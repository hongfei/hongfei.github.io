In her case, it also involved taking samples of tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Maria Waters had a hysteroscopy after experiencing unusual vaginal bleeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Right from the start, it was extremely painful, like I was being cut,’ says Maria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The toughest part was all the poking around as the hysteroscopist kept removing the scope and reinserting it – four times in all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I really struggled but I thought it would only last a few minutes longer and maybe I could bear it. Then I felt faint and nauseous.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the scope was inserted for a fourth time, she lost consciousness and came to with her legs being held up by staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I had collapsed due to shock – the ten-minute procedure lasted 35 minutes as the team had to wait for my blood pressure to return to normal. I had to spend about an hour in recovery before I was stable enough to leave.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the following days Maria says she bled ‘quite heavily’, and experienced abdominal cramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS does hundreds of thousands of hysteroscopies a year – it is the most common gynaecological procedure carried out in outpatient departments, with 263,572 performed in England alone, according to the latest figures. Most (68 per cent) were done in outpatients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The procedure is performed for many reasons – for example, to investigate infertility or abnormal bleeding, and to examine fibroids (benign growths in or around the womb) or polyps (growths of the inner lining of the uterus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A hysteroscopy is an examination of the inside of the uterus (womb) using a narrow telescope containing a camera&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hysteroscopies are also often combined with on-the-spot treatments, such as removal of polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Demand is growing steadily, mainly due to the rise in the proportion of older, post-menopausal women being investigated for abnormal bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other factors include rising rates of obesity (obesity is linked to endometrial cancer) and high numbers of women on HRT reporting abnormal bleeding (possibly due to oestrogen stimulating the lining of the uterus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years ago, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) published guidelines on outpatient hysteroscopy management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It said while most women tolerated the procedure, it could cause severe pain and even be traumatic – a third of women rated the pain as 7+ (on a pain scale out of ten), and this was something women should be told before having the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, the RCOG said hysteroscopists must stop the procedure at either the woman’s request or that of staff, if they considered she was in too much pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as encouraging women to take simple analgesia beforehand (ibuprofen and/or paracetamol) the guidance set out further options for pain control, such as a local anaesthesia injection into the cervix at the beginning of the procedure or inhaled sedation/analgesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if the procedure had to be stopped, it should be rescheduled, and the next time the woman should be offered intravenous sedation, an epidural or spinal anaesthesia or a general anaesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kathleen Ryan, 63, a retired nurse from Hall Green, Birmingham, opted to have a hysterectomy to avoid having hysteroscopies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet campaigners say too often these guidelines are being ignored, leaving women needlessly in excruciating pain during what should be a straightforward procedure. As a result, some are even saying they will no longer have these important investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Campaign Against Painful Hysteroscopy has collected data from thousands of women across the UK – and, as Good Health can reveal, the ongoing survey of almost 8,000 women shows the vast majority (83 per cent) were not told beforehand about the risk of severe pain and, alarmingly, 67 per cent said hysteroscopists didn’t immediately stop when they said they were in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the women (60 per cent) also said they continued with the procedure even though they were in pain, because they didn’t know there was an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-14ef4e60-f859-11ef-806d-61f62d901730" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14456067/women-warned-barbaric-procedure-leaves-traumatised-agony-no-longer-wanting-sex.html"&gt; &lt;font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;'WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SCREAMING, YOU START TO WORRY'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Until you’ve had a hysteroscopy, you do not know what pain is,’ says Kathleen Ryan, 63, a retired nurse from Birmingham. ‘It’s like somebody’s ripping your insides out. It’s torture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I’ve got a high pain threshold – I breezed my way through spiral fracture to my ankle, and it was a really bad break. I didn’t need any painkillers in the ambulance or after the operation.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she later had a hysterectomy, even then she didn’t need strong painkillers – ‘It is standard to take strong analgesia, but I just had a couple of paracetamol pills for a few days.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kathleen says she will never forget her first hysteroscopy in 2019 for post-menopausal bleeding, at Birmingham Women’s Hospital, where she had worked as a pain nurse until her recent retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s amazing to think now that I went along to the clinic never imagining what they would do,’ she says. ‘It’s only when you’re sat waiting when you can hear people screaming, that you start to worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I assumed there would be some sort of pain relief but there was absolutely none. I hadn’t been told to take any before either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There were two nurses either side of me who tried to distract me. When I gasped and said it was very painful, they said it’ll only last a minute or so. They made me feel like I was the only one who had found it painful; I thought I must be a real wuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When the gynaecologist removed the instruments, I felt like I was going to pass out. Then I sat up and saw the bucket under my legs full of blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I staggered to the day room, was given a cup of tea and a ginger biscuit, and then told I was ready to go. I was in such a state of shock, I was in the car park for an hour before I could even drive.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kathleen’s biopsies showed she had a pre-cancerous condition called complex atypical hyperplasia, and so would need regular hysteroscopies to monitor it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At her next appointment three months later, she says she pleaded for pain relief. ‘I was in agony and said: “You’ve got to stop!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was then given gas and air but it really didn’t help. As I was leaving, one of the nurses took my hand, and said: “Next time have a couple of gins before you come. It’ll help you relax.” I was stunned.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After that, the thought of having another procedure made Kathleen ‘a nervous wreck’. She was meant to have the procedures every three months but they were so horrendous she negotiated for them to be twice yearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘During one it was so painful, I flinched and said: “You have got to stop.” And the nurses got their elbows on my knee and pinned me down. It sounds medieval and it absolutely is.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On another occasion she took codeine and diazepam beforehand, as prescribed by her GP, but this made little difference. So the next time she requested a general anaesthetic but was told neither this nor sedation was possible as an outpatient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘With my next appointment looming in November 2021, I decided I wasn’t going back. I told a friend I didn’t care if I died – it seemed a better option.’ She saw a consultant privately and the following year had a full hysterectomy on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I thank God every day that I don’t need more hysteroscopies. But I can’t understand how in this day and age, something so brutalising is allowed. I would go as far as to say it’s a violent assault.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jocelyn Lewis, co-founder of the campaign, says most women (80 per cent) were unaware that they could even have a general anaesthetic or sedation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We simply want hysteroscopy without the pain,’ she says. ‘It is the only invasive procedure where women are guided – that’s the polite way of phrasing it – into outpatients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Despite what the guidance says, generally speaking, women are told that general anaesthetic and sedation aren’t available, and if they insist on wanting it they’ll have a long wait.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because it would involve them being admitted to a ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Most of these women, or a significant proportion, are having a hysteroscopy because they’ve got abnormal post-menopausal bleeding, so often they’re on the two-week cancer pathway as well,’ adds Jocelyn. ‘So they are faced with either the outpatient route, where they may suffer, or have a long wait. This is no choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So many women say the pain is worse than childbirth – some have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hysteroscopy also affects their personal relationships – some are just so traumatised by it, they no longer want to have sex.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Worryingly, most of the women say they will opt out of any future gynaecological checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Women refuse smear tests because they’ve gone for a hysteroscopy, and they are so unprepared for it being so painful that they lose trust in the gynaecological service,’ says Jocelyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So we risk the NHS not picking up gynaecological cancers.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alix Marijan, 53, an operations manager from Hanwell, West London, underwent a hysteroscopy last summer and found it so traumatic that she now says she would never repeat it without a general anaesthetic or at the very least sedation. The mother-of-three was referred for the procedure after unusual vaginal bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have never experienced pain like it,’ recalls Alix. ‘For the first five minutes, I gritted my teeth. But when it came to taking the biopsies, I began to feel sweaty and nauseous – the doctor kept removing the tube and reinserting it, about four times, and I remember the room spinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was told I could take paracetamol before if I wished, but I’ve always been fine with smear tests and I have quite a high pain threshold, so I didn’t bother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But I was arching my back with the pain – the nurse and an assistant held me in a position, but it felt like being pinned down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Surely, if a patient is in a great deal of pain, you should stop? The whole thing lasted about ten minutes, but it felt like longer. By the end of it, I was barely conscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When my partner Steve came to collect me, I was bent over double with horrendous cramping, and cold and shivering, with a headache. He was horrified and asked what had happened. We made it back home before I vomited.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many other women who’ve undergone a hysteroscopy, Alix assumed she was at fault for being unable to tolerate the pain, as she was led to believe most women get through the procedure without a fuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I now tell anyone I meet who needs a hysteroscopy not to be gaslighted into believing that you are just making a fuss by requesting pain relief,’ says Alix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I truly believe that if the procedure involved a tube and camera going up a man’s penis, a general anaesthetic would be standard.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Months on, she still feels traumatised by the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I would describe the procedure as barbaric and there was a complete failure to warn me about what was about to happen.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; The Campaign Against Painful Hysteroscopy’s objective is not to scare women off from having the procedure – because it’s important, says Jocelyn – ‘We want all women to be offered a real choice’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These horror stories – and I don’t think there’s an alternative way of describing them – are true and they have to be believed, but it is important to recognise they are not the majority,’ says Mary Connor, a gynaecologist from Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The practice wouldn’t have continued for 30 years if it was unacceptable for most women.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has trained thousands of doctors to perform the procedure and points to an audit in 2019 of more than 5,000 British women that found pain ‘for the majority was manageable’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But I suppose the thing that we forget is how vulnerable and disempowered people may feel when they are undergoing procedures. That’s why it’s so important with hysteroscopies to have a patient advocate, whose main job is to alert the hysteroscopist if the patient is in severe pain or distress and can’t, or is unable to, speak up.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last September, reports of women’s experiences prompted the RCOG to update its clinical guidance again. For instance, the advice includes using the narrowest possible hysteroscope and the lowest possible pressure of the fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It is disturbing to hear about some women’s negative experiences,’ says gynaecologist Geeta Kumar, vice president for clinical quality at the RCOG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If a procedure is traumatic, it can impact a woman’s life for ever. But the procedure is vital for many patients in order to diagnose and treat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘That is why the RCOG encourages all those carrying out hysteroscopies to read and follow our guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If we stopped doing outpatient hysteroscopies, it would be a massive disadvantage, not just because general anaesthesia carries additional risks, but because it takes away the choice of setting for many women and can lead to potential delay due to the current length of waiting lists for women waiting for procedures to be done in theatre. Right now, the NHS just doesn’t have the resources to increase that capacity.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A consultant gynaecologist at the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board in north Wales, Dr Kumar has been carrying out hysteroscopies for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The difficult thing is you can’t predict who will experience the most pain,’ she says. ‘There are certain features that can potentially predict a more painful procedure – if somebody gets very severe period pain or finds smears or speculum examinations painful, then those can be predictors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But it doesn’t always mean that they will not tolerate outpatient hysteroscopy – and it’s important to pre-warn all women and make sure that you discuss the options for pain relief beforehand.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maria Waters agrees that choice is key – and with the vantage point of a patient, she says: ‘I always used to tell women that the procedure may be painful, but is usually well-tolerated. I now add that it can be extremely painful for some, especially those who have not delivered a child vaginally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’m also extra careful to advise them to consider all their options and pain management ahead of their appointments as, during the consultation, there will be little time to discuss and weigh up options and alternatives.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An NHS spokesperson said: ‘While patients may feel some discomfort during intimate procedures like hysteroscopies, no one should have to experience pain, and all NHS trusts should be following the latest clinical guidance from the RCOG to deliver the best clinical and psychological care for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Different pain relief options should be discussed with a clinician before any procedure as part of NHS England’s standardised consent forms for hysteroscopy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 01:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0AFBVV95cUxQQ2pfYkF4MGV3Vk05RWVrSDRuTDVzbURybmhrNG01UXhhZlo2T0xPb0Zfd2ZZV0hTTzlCSlQ4bzd5QloxNF9SdDF2d2VPVmJSZHc0dzJ5NDI3U3JOU1k4Z3BIWmNXcmFPdU5YQ0hpR2lGRUlSYUJRWFlhbWlDQzY2S2hRU3pYZUloTTBEMnVzcl9NMzR6SjJVSGtuOVQ4eGFTWFFVMk9GLXktQXo2S2tWTzJ6TGFObjNnU1FzdDRXWm5GMW1UVGhIOHlJdHNoTjlY</guid></item><item><title>More than 50% of adults predicted to be obese by 2050 worldwide - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE50a3NxX3ZIV0pIUmdrRXpTbkN4SkJydnViRExOalNFNmo2V215d2hGQnM4NlBhTFlBa09UVUE2djFOOVVuY2tRT2w1ejBCSzlXV01obDljczV2d9IBX0FVX3lxTE1fOVROcXhNYWtxZnJfS25RZFRPaXV3S3NXbXZkVHZ6RVBvRVVBTkN5aFl5SC1mdXd0TmxLNS0xM2NMX3JJbmRqcTRsYTQ1amtLT1ZsTkgyY2lVdmN0cTlz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;More than half of all adults and a third of children, teenagers and young adults around the world are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The findings come in a new study of global data published in &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00355-1/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; journal, covering more than 200 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Researchers warn that obesity levels are predicted to accelerate rapidly during the remainder of this decade, particularly in lower-income countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, experts say that if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what they describe as a "profound tragedy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;By 2021, almost half the global adult population  - a billion men and 1.11 billion women aged 25 or older - were overweight or obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The proportion of both men and women living with these conditions has doubled since 1990. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If trends continue, global rates of overweight and obese adults would rise to about 57.4% for men and 60.3% for women by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In terms of raw numbers, China (627 million), India (450 million) and the USA (214 million) will be the countries with the biggest populations of overweight or obese people in 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, population growth means that forecasters are predicting the number in sub-Saharan Africa will rise by more than 250% to 522 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Nigeria, in particular, stands out, with the predicted number projected to more than triple - from 36.6 million in 2021 to 141 million in 2050. That would make it the country with the fourth-largest population of adults who are overweight or obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The authors acknowledge the study does not take into account the impact that new weight loss medications might have - and they could play a significant role in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Experts say if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what could be a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The research was led by Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), at the University of Washington in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said: "[Governments] can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A surge in rates of obesity is happening right now, particularly among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Rates of obesity in children and younger teenagers (from 8.8% to 18.1%) and younger adults (those under 25 - from 9.9% to 20.3%) more than doubled between 1990 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, by 2050 one in three young people will be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The co-lead author of the report, Dr Jessica Kerr of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia, says the figures present a real challenge to health care systems in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"But if we act now, preventing a complete transition to global obesity for children and adolescents is still possible," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Our estimates identify children and adolescents in much of Europe and south Asia living with overweight who should be targeted with obesity prevention strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We have also identified large populations, particularly adolescent girls, in North America, Australasia, Oceania, North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America that are expected to tip over to obesity predominance and require urgent, multifaceted intervention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This is essential to avoid intergenerational transmission of obesity and to prevent a wave of serious health conditions and dire financial and societal costs for future generations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 01:25:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE50a3NxX3ZIV0pIUmdrRXpTbkN4SkJydnViRExOalNFNmo2V215d2hGQnM4NlBhTFlBa09UVUE2djFOOVVuY2tRT2w1ejBCSzlXV01obDljczV2d9IBX0FVX3lxTE1fOVROcXhNYWtxZnJfS25RZFRPaXV3S3NXbXZkVHZ6RVBvRVVBTkN5aFl5SC1mdXd0TmxLNS0xM2NMX3JJbmRqcTRsYTQ1amtLT1ZsTkgyY2lVdmN0cTlz</guid></item><item><title>Senators question FDA nominee on canceled flu shot meeting amid severe flu season - KOMO News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxPUDM1RG5IT2RnOG5tQ1ExNzZzdWtiN2F5R1hZNFZaQWQtX0Z4dS01VDlrWDhGTllTOU5ydWRGWFlfX2xFN0ZTU2Q1NVE1cnlNWlJGYWVoMkRSbGUzUnZCX1IwcGVLd2x3WXNlTXBsUE9TM3hnSzFWZHlYNzdvWG5GQ1RIbmtiLWpvM2YwZkxGcHFjSkd6ejZIZVhuZzhfODFTS3lJYUJGQmQ5bWdFeEpTcVA1dnA3bkk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;WASHINGTON, D.C. (KATU) — &lt;/span&gt;U.S. Senators Patty Murray, Tammy Baldwin, and Angela Alsobrooks expressed grave concerns over the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision to &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/114399" target="_blank" title="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/114399" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;cancel &lt;/a&gt;a critical meeting amid the worst flu season in 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) meeting, originally scheduled for March 13, was intended to discuss and recommend influenza strains for the upcoming flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter sent on Friday to Dr. Marty Makary, President Trump's nominee for FDA Commissioner, the senators criticized the cancellation, pushing the importance of the annual meeting. "The cancellation of next week’s VRBPAC meeting is unprecedented," they wrote. "This Committee has met every year for the past 30 years to discuss the influenza virus vaccines for the upcoming flu season and make recommendations to the FDA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine efficacy for the 2024-2025 flu season was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;up to 78%&lt;/a&gt; against influenza-associated hospitalization. According to &lt;a href="https://www.flu.com/Articles/2024/2024-2025-Flu-Vaccine-Effectiveness" target="_blank" title="https://www.flu.com/Articles/2024/2024-2025-Flu-Vaccine-Effectiveness" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;flu.com&lt;/a&gt;, even vaccines, even with lower effectiveness, can mean the difference between a mild illness and a hospital stay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have suggested flu vaccination lowers the risk of flu-related hospitalization by 41% in young children and 82% in adults. People who who still get sick with flu even after getting the vaccine are also less likely to be admitted to the ICU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ ALSO: &lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/nation-world/san-antonio-texas-school-confirms-case-of-rubella-german-measles-as-measles-rubeola-outbreak-in-state-reaches-146-vaccinations-child-death-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-contagious-infection#" target="_blank" title="https://katu.com/news/nation-world/san-antonio-texas-school-confirms-case-of-rubella-german-measles-as-measles-rubeola-outbreak-in-state-reaches-146-vaccinations-child-death-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-contagious-infection#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Texas school confirms case of rubella as measles outbreak in state reaches 146&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has &lt;a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html" target="_blank" title="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;that the current flu season has resulted in at least 33 million illnesses, 430,000 hospitalizations, and 19,000 deaths as of Feb. 15, 2025. The senators warned that any delay in the VRBPAC meeting could impact the availability and effectiveness of flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the FDA canceling the meeting, the CDC also &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/fda-annual-flu-vaccine-meeting-and-cdc-s-wild-to-mild-campaign-canceled" target="_blank" title="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/fda-annual-flu-vaccine-meeting-and-cdc-s-wild-to-mild-campaign-canceled" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;canceled &lt;/a&gt;its "Wild to Mild" campaign which aims at promoting flu vaccinations. The campaign was revealed in the fall of 2023, aiming to "reset public expectations around the benefits of flu vaccination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from Cornell University showed better protection and broader immunity to various flu strains could be achieved by taking a COVID-flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter questioned Dr. Makary's stance on public health leadership, urging him to clarify his position on vaccine skepticism. "We intend to use your nomination hearing next week to understand whether you support this ill-informed measure to slow critical public health decision making," the senators stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Makary is scheduled to appear before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee on March 6 for his nomination hearing. The senators requested that he be prepared to address several questions regarding the rescheduling of the VRBPAC meeting and his commitment to accepting expert recommendations for vaccine development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO News</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:10:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxPUDM1RG5IT2RnOG5tQ1ExNzZzdWtiN2F5R1hZNFZaQWQtX0Z4dS01VDlrWDhGTllTOU5ydWRGWFlfX2xFN0ZTU2Q1NVE1cnlNWlJGYWVoMkRSbGUzUnZCX1IwcGVLd2x3WXNlTXBsUE9TM3hnSzFWZHlYNzdvWG5GQ1RIbmtiLWpvM2YwZkxGcHFjSkd6ejZIZVhuZzhfODFTS3lJYUJGQmQ5bWdFeEpTcVA1dnA3bkk</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. tells parents to consider MMR vaccine amid outbreak - The Hill</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNVHV5LUptdkc4U01aMHozUjVNNUp0bER1aEs4bDVSNmlxLUdBa0FjOW9Bb1VyQWV6UU55WnoyeTd2blFfcDNYaEtvQmZWR042b3R2aTJJR2FHTDN0c2RHUWtHRkhUSV96T1hRR3FXT2lsUUVEQXR0OU1ZSEZlYklhZ0d6NExUb0poQ0hBN0tfeGlQSjVEc2dxNXln0gGfAUFVX3lxTE9ac0xuV3dBdWpuOGRhVWNQVWpiTUdLYkIwTVJTNklRVWFRNFF1Nm5OQUdwRjB3czlHSmI0QTF4Vi03WC13blJOUnFhSEZzUGFaM1BZc1ZscW82LWZUZHQ0MVpLYjBzcDN2TmpFOHRjTzlfelQ3TjlHR1JaOUR2dmFHMEJpWWZOUjNiWnRkbk9vbVJId3l0ZVlQaGdGUmJzaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

I didn't know where it came from, and until they you know, then we had our meetings, and they told us it was like inherited from your parents," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynch Syndrome is caused by genetic mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes.

Just to break those promises before January is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, being able to develop and maintain a good habit is crucial to living a healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/noncommunicable-diseases#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;noncommunicable diseases&lt;/a&gt; (NCDs), including heart disease, stroke and diabetes, are collectively responsible for 74% of all deaths globally. While these diseases tend to be the result of a combination of genetic, physiological and environmental factors, behavioral factors also come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the biggest behavioral — and preventable — risk factors include: insufficient physical activity, unhealthy diets, harmful use of alcohol and tobacco use, according to a December &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/noncommunicable-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, there is one brain hack that could help keep a healthy habit: preaching. That's according to Nir Eyal, behavioral design expert and best-selling author of "Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-styles-makeit-subtitle--JP3GH"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Re-engineering tool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to use preaching as a tool to re-engineer or strengthen your identity. Doing so can help you become more consistent with a good habit, Eyal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ever heard the joke: How do you know someone's a vegetarian? Don't worry, they'll tell you," wrote Eyal in a recent LinkedIn &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nireyal_ever-heard-the-joke-how-do-you-know-someone-activity-7300665947911016448-GTGV?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=member_ios&amp;amp;amp;rcm=ACoAACX-esUBBGd-sekv3DVpZtEiopAyVK6q0jo" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This isn't just a joke — it reveals something powerful about behavior. The people who stick to a philosophy— whether it's vegetarianism, keto, or intermittent fasting — are the ones who talk about it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-container--Gwv2j" data-test="Pullquote"&gt;&lt;div class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-pullquote--yciaK Pullquote-styles-makeit-pullquoteBase--I6tb3"&gt;&lt;p class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-quotemark--wOJVx"&gt;&lt;span class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-quotemark1--_xuDE"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-quotemark2--Fbxk0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-wrapper--J7kni"&gt;&lt;p class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-quote--PKfrc"&gt;When you tell other people: 'keto is the way,' or 'I read this book and now I'm a follower of this methodology,' or whatever the case might be — by preaching about it, you're more likely to abide by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-sourceWrapper--_Vvz3"&gt;&lt;p class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-sourceAccentWrapper--Ubl5i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-source--S2oO1"&gt;Nir Eyal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Pullquote-styles-makeit-info--K2Jz_"&gt;Author, “Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because preaching can help reinforce identity, Eyal said. The same way a vegetarian probably wouldn't wonder whether or not to eat a steak for dinner, or someone who is kosher wouldn't wake up wondering if they should eat bacon for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you tell other people: 'keto is the way,' or 'I read this book and now I'm a follower of this methodology,' or whatever the case might be — by preaching about it, you're more likely to abide by it," Eyal told &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/"&gt;CNBC Make It.&lt;/a&gt; "What would otherwise just be an opinion, becomes an identity, and that's when it's very, very hard to shape."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with identity reinforcement, consistency bias is another reason why preaching could help with being consistent with a good habit, according to Eyal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at the work from the 1980s by &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/016502548901200305" target="_blank"&gt;Robert Cialdini&lt;/a&gt;, it's a well-known principle that we seek to be consistent with our past behavior, and in psychology, we call this a &lt;a href="https://advertising.sagepub.com/blog/the-consistency-bias/" target="_blank"&gt;consistency bias&lt;/a&gt;," Eyal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't want to be inconsistent because it makes us look like liars," he said. "So, if you say one thing, you seek to be consistent with what you said. Ironically, even if, deep down, you want to change your mind, it's difficult to do, because you were already committed to it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social pressure also plays a role. "When we declare something publicly, we are held accountable to it based on our social bonds," Eyal said. There's a fear that if we abandon our habits or publicly-stated beliefs, it can reflect poorly on us or ostracize us from our community, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're a very social species, so anything that threatens our group identity is very terrifying, so we're more likely to stay consistent," Eyal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an important caveat is that we shouldn't be a "jerk" about it, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is also a great way to lose friends. If people think you're putting yourself in one group and putting them in a different group — that can be harmful. So you want to make sure that [while] something is good for you, [it's] not alienating to others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to make extra money outside of your day job?&lt;/strong&gt; Sign up for CNBC's online course &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://cnb.cx/4a0v4qh" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Earn Passive Income Online&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plus, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it-newsletters/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 23:09:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxORzdwR29BTnVmMUdoRFp2VjktZVVRcGdHbE90blRXaVNWQkUzaW1vMXNPMTJXdFowQXFGc2RNdjlsQWVQdmVxWWkzeTR3OVVWN255bUdxTll1d0ppLURiMFI2QjR3NFZZbE1CZXBXVDBMc3c2ZF9WazQyb1lCdUpzUjd3Mm54TVdaV0ZZLVdpQ1pYbzBocUk1amVhVkZjTzJJ0gGmAUFVX3lxTFBabFhTWGdGSTFjazREcXR5YnhQcXByUVlpeTNhVzBKUGVVamMwVWV3YWZXWWxsMGVacXZtaG1IRHhSbEUwbXZPSDVleTZEWmhmZ01Zc0RSRjRtM1VpcDBfU0NZTkNmMVdXTVJTMThEU015dlY3SXhhSUY5MEY5WUpxdWlvMWJmWlc4NHFWSThDTC0tNko1aXVnZ1BxT2ljb3gxX213NVE</guid></item><item><title>Kennedy sends mixed vaccine messages amid Texas measles outbreak - The Hill</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQUWNnMEVBcHI4cWh6eHAwRVJqdHBBRTBNc3pPTloyZzladXlMQTVVd1BSZUszUTh1VHBEcnE0eUZuLVN4SGdhT1lfTmpmMlo3TS1uY0xJS3dqQ0hpQjFQbVduWXhRbldfbTlobmNLd2RNMEJ6TzdiZTRYRGtFWFRJczVGcDhrLUFQV1ExYdIBkgFBVV95cUxNYW5nVXFGZnExdEdHWlV0S3hQSFhrcDZFcVJFZmZ6LV8tMy1HQ1A1OEd3WkNEazlLZ3lVWnVnVnBLVXFtN1g3T3ZvUEpTR0Z3RW5KSU1uWDk1djBoejhwS1BNVG55dEQweTU4bURZT01XcXZDeG8tcDJVbnY0QmJyTXQxNXMycFhBenRXR3VaQ1Zfdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Even small shifts toward a Western diet correlated with a 66% higher risk of ADHD and a 122% higher risk of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest associations were observed during the first and second trimesters, suggesting that early fetal brain development is particularly sensitive to maternal nutrition. Researchers identified specific blood metabolites linked to diet that may explain this connection, highlighting the potential for dietary interventions to support neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; A Western diet during pregnancy was linked to a 66% higher risk of ADHD and a 122% higher risk of autism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Window:&lt;/strong&gt; The strongest associations were found in the first and second trimesters, emphasizing early fetal brain sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for Intervention:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings suggest that even small dietary improvements may help reduce neurodevelopmental risks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoking, alcohol, and unhealthy diets have long been known to influence fetal development. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a comprehensive clinical study from the University of Copenhagen and the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC) at the Danish Paediatric Asthma Centre, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, has found an association between maternal diet during pregnancy and the development of ADHD and autism in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The greater a woman’s adherence to a Western diet in pregnancy – high in fat, sugar, and refined products while low in fish, vegetables, and fruit—the greater the risk appears to be for her child developing ADHD or autism,” says lead author, Dr David Horner, MD, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108029"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two pregnant women and food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study finds a strong association between a Western dietary pattern during pregnancy and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD and autism. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified a Western dietary pattern using data-driven analysis. Even moderate shifts along this dietary spectrum were associated with a markedly increased risk. For example, slight deviations towards a more Western diet were linked to a 66% increased risk of ADHD and a 122% increased risk of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this also presents an opportunity: even small dietary adjustments away from a Western pattern could potentially reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over 60,000 Mother-Child Pairs Analysed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reach these findings, researchers analysed dietary patterns, blood samples, and ADHD diagnoses across four large independent cohorts in Denmark and the United States, encompassing more than 60,000 mother-child pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood samples were analysed using metabolomics, providing insights into the biological mechanisms linking diet to neurodevelopmental disorders and serving as a validation method for the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between Western dietary patterns and ADHD was observed across all four cohorts and validated in three of them using three different methods, reinforcing the study’s credibility, according to David Horner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study draws on a highly detailed and robust dataset where nearly 600 children were clinically assessed for neurodevelopmental disorders at age 10. To ensure the reliability of the findings, researchers accounted for a range of factors, including genetics, which is known to play a major role in neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, a clear association between a maternal Western diet and the risk of ADHD and autism remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “A Western dietary pattern during pregnancy is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood and adolescence,” has been published today in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greatest Risk in Early Pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key strengths of this study is the high quality of the biological samples, which included repeated metabolomic measurements throughout pregnancy and childhood. This allowed researchers to demonstrate that the association of diet on ADHD risk was strongest in early and mid-pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When comparing across cohorts, we observed the strongest associations in the first and second trimesters, suggesting that brain development during this period is particularly sensitive to maternal nutritional influences,” explains senior author Professor Morten Arendt Rasmussen from the University of Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers identified 43 specific metabolites in maternal blood that were linked to a Western diet and could help explain the connection between diet and neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that 15 of these 43 metabolites were particularly linked to the increased risk of ADHD. Many of these metabolites are derived from dietary intake and play key roles in regulating inflammation and oxidative stress—factors believed to be critical in early neurodevelopment,” says David Horner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are Current Dietary Guidelines for Pregnant Women Effective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to David Horner, this study raises important questions about whether current dietary guidelines for pregnant women are sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Denmark, dietary recommendations for pregnant women largely mirror those for the general population, emphasising a balanced diet rich in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and fish rather than red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that nutritional demands increase during pregnancy, and our study highlights just how crucial dietary composition is for foetal development. While the Nordic diet is often considered healthy, our data show that many pregnant women follow dietary patterns that could be optimised to better support their child’s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study raises the question of whether existing dietary recommendations are sufficiently followed during pregnancy—and whether they have the desired impact on child health,” says David Horner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that the study not only demonstrates an association between diet and ADHD risk but also provides insights into specific nutrients and food groups that could play a vital role in foetal brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our analysis not only confirms a strong link between diet and ADHD risk but also identifies specific nutrients and foods that could serve as the foundation for improved dietary guidelines and preventative strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By understanding how maternal diet influences foetal development, we can better identify the key nutrients and dietary adjustments needed to reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. This opens new possibilities for refining dietary recommendations and promoting healthier outcomes for future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by COPSAC and the University of Copenhagen, in collaboration with the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) and the VDAART cohort in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study finds a strong association between a Western dietary pattern during pregnancy and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings for ADHD were validated in 3 independent mother-child cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest associations between a Western diet and ADHD risk were observed in the first and second trimesters, suggesting that foetal brain development during this period is particularly sensitive to maternal nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used a combination of dietary records, blood analyses, genetic data, and clinical diagnoses from four large mother-child cohorts to investigate whether a Western diet during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of ADHD and autism in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Four Cohorts Analysed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;COPSAC2010 (Denmark, 508 mother-child pairs) – Primary cohort with detailed neurodevelopmental clinical assessments at 10 years, and five metabolomics time points in both mother and child, as well as foetal dry blood spot metabolomics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC, Denmark, 59,725 mother-child pairs) – Large population-based study used to validate FFQ-based dietary patterns against ADHD diagnoses in national registers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;VDAART (USA, 656 mother-child pairs) – Used to validate dietary patterns and blood metabolites from both pregnancy and childhood in relation to ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;COPSAC2000 (Denmark, 348 mother-child pairs) – Used to analyse fetal dry blood spot metabolomes to identify a metabolic signature of a Western dietary pattern and validate its link to ADHD symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an observational study, meaning it shows a strong statistical association but does not conclusively prove that a Western diet causes ADHD or autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary information was collected through self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), which may introduce recall bias and inaccuracies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;However, dietary patterns were identified using data-driven methods (minimising bias), and machine learning models were employed to identify metabolite scores as an objective biomarker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetics also play a major role. ADHD and autism have a high genetic component (up to 80% heritability).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women with a more Western diet often had higher BMI, smoked during pregnancy, and used more antibiotics, which may independently effect child development. The study adjusted for these factors but cannot fully rule out other lifestyle influences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pregnancy, diet, and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e0ad938aa0938389858e8385ce8b95ce848b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Michael Jensen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ku.dk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Michael Jensen – University of Copenhagen&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01230-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A western dietary pattern during pregnancyis associated with neurodevelopmentaldisorders in childhood and adolescence&lt;/a&gt;” by David Horner et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A western dietary pattern during pregnancyis associated with neurodevelopmentaldisorders in childhood and adolescence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the high prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders, the influence of maternal diet during pregnancy on child neurodevelopment remains understudied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that a western dietary pattern during pregnancy is associated with child neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyse self-reported maternal dietary patterns at 24 weeks of pregnancy and clinically evaluated neurodevelopmental disorders at 10 years of age in the COPSAC2010 cohort (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 508).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We find significant associations with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We validate the ADHD findings in three large, independent mother–child cohorts (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 59,725, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 656 and &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 348) through self-reported dietary modelling, maternal blood metabolomics and foetal blood metabolomics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolome analyses identify 15 mediating metabolites in pregnancy that improve ADHD prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal blood metabolome analyses, incorporating five time points per cohort in two independent cohorts, reveal that associations between western dietary pattern metabolite scores and neurodevelopmental outcomes are consistently significant in early–mid-pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the potential for targeted prenatal dietary interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental disorders and emphasise the importance of early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 22:52:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBfVk5xckJMczJ5WGhTTG9HdURXdG5wdEdvX1k0aFltRlJkbTMtYXhEVnl1QkVaeGZRaUZ2WjZyNmJoMFctU1d4b20xTHBLaFJNUHNCNUVva19za3VzT0FUcXY4LWY2Mk01dVI0</guid></item><item><title>Brain Changes From Early-Life Stress May Be Reversible - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTFBqVXJBTDNkdlFiVDNrQmh4Y0xYekxSTW1kVlRVTlRSUExhekIwU21kWWZkQ3F4bXBQNUNqeVZWMW9jNGVrU3FoMnhPajZ0c3FvSGdKaDVUMzYtM21RTkpIV0p2VUlzM1MzV0ZYSUVZNHlpZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals how prenatal infections followed by early-life stress—known as “two-hit stress”—can lead to brain dysfunction and psychiatric-like behaviors. Researchers found that affected mice showed abnormal cerebellar activity, increased microglial turnover, and impaired brain-wide connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, microglia replacement therapy successfully reversed these effects, offering a potential new approach for mental health treatments. The findings suggest that sex differences may influence stress resilience, highlighting the need for personalized treatments for psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two-Hit Stress Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Prenatal infection and early-life stress disrupt cerebellar function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microglia’s Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased microglial turnover and neuronal loss contribute to brain dysfunction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Therapy:&lt;/strong&gt; Microglia replacement reversed stress-induced abnormalities in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Kyoto University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having one traumatic experience is bad enough. If you’ve constantly experienced stress since before birth, you may be in for an especially tough time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our emotions may be influenced by infections experienced in the mother’s womb. This can result from &lt;em&gt;two-hit stress&lt;/em&gt;, where an infection during pregnancy is followed by social stress during postpartum development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108025"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/microglia-therapy-early-stress-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study also revealed neuronal loss in the cerebellum, a reduction in the action potential firing of remaining cerebellar neurons, and a decrease in brain-wide functional connectivity. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at Kyoto University recently set out to understand the mechanisms behind which two-hit stress contributes to brain dysfunction and mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They conducted a comprehensive investigation of the social and cognitive behaviors of mice that have been exposed to such stress, paying particular attention to anxiety-like behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, this team demonstrated that acute inflammation in the cerebellum caused by a bacterial infection induces &lt;em&gt;neural plasticity&lt;/em&gt;, which in turn may lead to hyper-excitability in the brain and the onset of depressive and autism-like symptoms. Yet exactly how two-hit stress contributes to changes in the brain had remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subject mice in the current investigation were allowed to freely explore, revealing extensive behavioral differences in two-hit mice, correlating with abnormalities in the cerebellum. In particular, the researchers observed a significant increase in the number and turnover of &lt;em&gt;microglia&lt;/em&gt;, the primary immune cells found in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed neuronal loss in the cerebellum, a reduction in the action potential firing of remaining cerebellar neurons, and a decrease in brain-wide functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results indicate cerebellar cognitive dysfunctions in animals exposed to two-hit stress,” says team member Momoka Hikosaka. The exposure to such stress altered the microglial reactivity in the cerebella of both male and female mice, leading to cerebellar dysfunction and behaviors resembling psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not all bad news. To rescue the exposed mice, the researchers used &lt;em&gt;microglia replacement&lt;/em&gt; to ameliorate the effects of two-hit stress. Suppressing microglia can also be effective, but systemic depletion of microglia typically weakens immunity, making the body more susceptible to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To address this limitation, our team performed cerebellum-specific microglia replacement, which worked remarkably well,” says corresponding author Gen Ohtsuki, adding, “We were impressed to observe that the female mice showed notably higher stress resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that in some animals, sex differences in response to chronic inflammatory stress emerge in the cerebellum under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, personalized medicine for mental health may require considering sex differences as an important factor, which could also be applied to neurodegenerative diseases and aging treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these findings provide new pathways for understanding the biological mechanisms behind mental disorders, and have the potential to transform both scientific approaches and societal attitudes toward helping those affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and stress research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#650d1007070009094b120d0c110b001c4b5104250e1c0a110a48104b04064b0f15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Whitney Hubbell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyoto-u.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kyoto University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Whitney Hubbell – Kyoto University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-07566-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Maternal immune activation followed by peripubertal stress combinedly produce reactive microglia and confine cerebellar cognition&lt;/a&gt;” by Momoka Hikosaka et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maternal immune activation followed by peripubertal stress combinedly produce reactive microglia and confine cerebellar cognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The functional alteration of microglia arises in brains exposed to external stress during early development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathophysiological findings of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder suggest cerebellar functional deficits. However, the link between stress-induced microglia reactivity and cerebellar dysfunction is missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we investigate the developmental immune environment in translational mouse models that combine two risk factors: maternal infection and repeated social defeat stress (2HIT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find the synergy of inflammatory stress insults, leading to microglial increase specifically in the cerebellum of both sexes. Microglial turnover correlates with the Purkinje neuron loss in 2HIT mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly multiplexed imaging-mass-cytometry identifies a cell transition to TREM2(+) stress-associated microglia in the cerebellum. Single-cell-proteomic clustering reveals IL-6- and TGFβ-signaling association with microglial cell transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduced excitability of remaining Purkinje cells, cerebellum-involved brain-wide functional dysconnectivity, and behavioral abnormalities indicate cerebellar cognitive dysfunctions in 2HIT animals, which are ameliorated by both systemic and cerebellum-specific microglia replacement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 22:37:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBqVXJBTDNkdlFiVDNrQmh4Y0xYekxSTW1kVlRVTlRSUExhekIwU21kWWZkQ3F4bXBQNUNqeVZWMW9jNGVrU3FoMnhPajZ0c3FvSGdKaDVUMzYtM21RTkpIV0p2VUlzM1MzV0ZYSUVZNHlpZw</guid></item><item><title>2 in 3 people with Sjögren’s disease have challenges in sexual relationships - Sjogren's Syndrome News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxQdmZ4dnZENGh5UWdDc2s5alRWM3otX3ZfbHBOQmp4ZGU3bFJOeW9sTVRTeDFMUk14S19lYVpLZG9ERXpRUzhtSjZta0tDMUt0Smlrd0UzYUJIbUV6N1hfNVhaVzFxaVRzbmN0THJXTU9BSmZsNXM0cExwNGstYlZJY3hUbzJlQUF0eE0tNWU5Z0E4Q0hDc0g4UE0tRDVEV0U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 2 in 3 women and men with &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/what-is-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s disease&lt;/a&gt; experience challenges in their sexual lives that go beyond physical symptoms, such as vaginal dryness or difficulty getting and keeping an erection, and these may include stress, social taboos, and poor body image, a study finds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical and emotional challenges “interact with each other and together shape the sexual experience,” wrote researchers in the Netherlands, who noted that “future research should focus on the patient as a whole person, and not solely on physical sexual functions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/11/1/e004990"&gt;Sexual experience and functioning in male and female patients with Sjögren’s disease: a qualitative study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;RMD Open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sjögren’s is an autoimmune disease wherein the immune system mistakenly launches an attack against moisture-producing glands, such as those that produce tears and saliva. The most common &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/symptoms-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; is unusual dryness in the eyes and mouth. But the disease can cause fatigue and other symptoms that &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/news/mental-physical-health-decline-sjogrens-syndrome-symptoms-daily-activities/"&gt;interfere with daily activities&lt;/a&gt;, including sexual relations. In women, vaginal dryness can make sexual intercourse painful, while erectile dysfunction is a common complaint among men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the problem “has received limited attention in both research and clinical practice,” wrote the researchers, who interviewed 11 women and nine men, ages 24-65, to learn how Sjögren’s impacted their sexual lives. Seven (63.6%) of the women scored less than 26.55 points on the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire, indicating sexual dysfunction, which can be defined as having difficulty during any stage of normal sexual activities. Two-thirds (66.7%) of the men scored less than 25 points in the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), indicating sexual dysfunction, in this case, difficulty getting and keeping an erection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Sexual challenges with Sjögren’s disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the interviews, which lasted an average of 1.5 hours, both women and men mentioned &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/symptoms-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;symptoms of Sjögren’s&lt;/a&gt;, stress, the fact that their disease isn’t visible, how they see and cope with their disease, the quality of their sexual relationships, and social taboos as factors that affect their sexual functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women experienced vaginal dryness and pain during sex, while men experienced erectile dysfunction. Even with treatments such as lubricants, these symptoms made some patients develop a poor body image and feel insecure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many faced trauma or long-term stress before their &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/diagnosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;diagnosis of Sjögren’s&lt;/a&gt;, including divorce, abuse, or losing loved ones. Some shared these experiences openly, while others revealed them later. Many believed stress triggered their disease, making coping more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said symptoms like fatigue and pain caused discomfort and made physical intimacy difficult. Dry mouth made kissing painful and talking difficult, which affected being able to develop emotional bonds. The severity of symptoms also affected sexual satisfaction, leading some to focus on nonsexual intimacy instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Sjögren’s is an “invisible” disease, many patients felt misunderstood and alone, and didn’t share details at work or with loved ones. Those who stayed silent felt pressured “to live their life as ‘normal’ as possible,” while those who spoke up felt unheard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the participants viewed their disease affected how they coped with sexual challenges. Some ignored their symptoms, while others used lubricants or adapted their sexual practices. Those who accepted their diagnosis coped better and felt more satisfied with their sex lives. Women were generally more open to finding solutions than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most patients found it difficult to talk about sexuality due to social taboos, especially those who had little emotional support growing up. Many felt alone and avoided discussing their challenges with doctors, fearing it was inappropriate. A lack of awareness among healthcare providers only made this worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even within strong and stable friendships, participants reported hesitance in addressing issues concerning their sexual problems and doubts because they considered this to be a too personal subject to discuss and/or they experienced shame and insecurity about the problems,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the study included only a small number of patients, it showed that “sexual experience in both female and male patients with [Sjögren’s disease] is shaped by far more factors than physical sexual functioning alone,” the researchers wrote. “Many of the interviewed patients reported an unmet need for support, advice, and treatment of sexuality-related symptoms related to [Sjögren’s disease] within healthcare,” showing there’s a need for better medical support and open discussions about sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;

That end-of-the-year number likewise represented a 62-case increase between 2024 and 2023 (96 infections.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Multnomah County Health Department did not immediately respond to request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt"&gt;Housing is a major factor in the spread, say Portland health officials&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The dysentery infection currently spreading most prominently among Multnomah County is shigellosis, the most common form of dysentery infection caused by the shigella bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/about/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; that in the U.S., approximately half a million people per year become infected with shigellosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the Portland area, health officials said 56% of cases were among people experiencing homelessness and 55% of cases reported methamphetamine and/or opiate usage. The spread is more prominent amongst drug users and men who have sexual contact with other men, as anal contact is more likely to spread the disease via infected fecal particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The rising rate of people with unstable housing situations in the metro area – and therefore less access to plumbing and other hygiene needs – has likely been a major contributor to the spread, something the city&lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2025/02/public-toilets-could-help-stop-the-spread-of-dysentery-yes-dysentery-in-portland.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; previously tried to address&lt;/a&gt; by maintaining public toilets near areas with a high unhoused population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Housing is related to nearly all aspects of health, including infectious diseases,” the Multnomah County Health Department told KOIN in a statement. “Lacking housing creates a context that can increase the risk of multiple kinds of infectious disease. When you don’t have housing, it is harder to prevent infectious disease and harder to access care to treat disease compared to if you are housed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dr. John Townes, medical director for infection prevention and control at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University, told &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2025/02/public-toilets-could-help-stop-the-spread-of-dysentery-yes-dysentery-in-portland.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;The Oregonian&lt;/a&gt; the trend can be curbed by simple, increased access to public toilets and handwash stations year-round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If you want to stop an outbreak of shigella, you give people toilets and soap and water,” Townes told the outlet. “And you train them in how to wash their hands.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The local health department is working to provide temporary housing for those who do test positive, both local outlets reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt"&gt;What is dysentery?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dysentery is a gastrointestinal disease caused by an infection that is most commonly recognized by the trademark symptom of bloody diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are two main types, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23567-dysentery" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;: Amoebic dysentery (amoebiasis), which is caused by a parasite, most commonly one called Entamoeba histolytica. People in the U.S. are more likely to become infected with this form of dysentery if they recently traveled to a country with poorer water sanitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The second type, Bacillary dysentery, is caused by a bacterial infection and is the most common type of dysentery. Some of the most common bacteria that cause this form of dysentery include shigella, salmonella, campylobacter and E. coli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The most common form is dysentery caused by the shigella bacteria, in which case the infection is called shigellosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dysentery of any kind is most commonly spread via the ingestion of food or water that has been handled by an infected person. Because it spreads through trace fecal particles, unwashed hands can often be the culprit for the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/03/USAT/81175745007-getty-images-2156313024.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=372&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/03/USAT/81175745007-getty-images-2156313024.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=744&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Dysentery is often spread via contaminated water and food."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Dysentery is often spread via contaminated water and food." data-c-credit="Tomas Vynikal, Getty Images"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt"&gt;Symptoms of dysentery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Some major symptoms, like diarrhea, are consistent across infection types.

However, mild symptoms may occur and include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;High fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Nausea and vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Upset stomach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;In rare cases, an abscess may form as a result of the parasite moving&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Dehydration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Bacillary dysentery&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Symptoms of bacillary dysentery often occur 1-3 days after infection and may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Diarrhea containing blood or mucus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;High fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Nausea and vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Painful stomach cramps (abdominal pain)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Dehydration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;In severe cases, it may cause extreme inflammation, widening (dilation) of your large intestine and acute kidney disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While many of these symptoms may sound relatively common, dysentery is not only highly contagious but can and does result in death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In fact, diarrhoeal disease, which includes dysentery and cholera, is the third leading cause of death in children under 5 worldwide and is responsible for killing around 443,832 children every year, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diarrhoeal-disease" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Most people can recover on their own with basic care like drinking plenty of water within 7-14 days.

&lt;p&gt;Allison Burk’s daughter was struggling. The American &lt;strong&gt;teenager &lt;/strong&gt;had uncontrolled emotions, a decreased ability to pay attention and trouble completing work on time. A family doctor suggested testing for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led to an unexpected discovery: The teen had ADHD, and her mother, Allison Burk, did too. During her daughter’s testing, Burk thought, “Wait a minute. This sounds &lt;strong&gt;familiar&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was able to piece together that this might be something I was experiencing,” said Burk, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. She sought testing for herself and was &lt;strong&gt;diagnosed&lt;/strong&gt; with ADHD — at 42 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More adults are being diagnosed with ADHD. Diagnoses have been rising for at least 20 years but seem to have increased sharply in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent government study suggested that more than 15 million adults in the United States — about 1 in 17 — have been diagnosed with ADHD. The condition starts in childhood, but about half of adults with ADHD are diagnosed when they are 18 or older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some doctors say the number of people seeking ADHD testing is sharply increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just in our &lt;strong&gt;clinic&lt;/strong&gt;, requests for &lt;strong&gt;assessments&lt;/strong&gt; have doubled in the last two years,” said Justin Barterian. He is a &lt;strong&gt;psychologist &lt;/strong&gt;based at Ohio State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signs of ADHD in adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD makes it hard for people to pay attention and control their behaviors. The disorder can be genetic. Doctors often treat the disorder with drugs, behavioral therapy, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judy Sandler is 62 years old and lives in the U.S. state of Maine. She was diagnosed in her 50s. Sandler describes what ADHD feels like for her. “It’s like there’s an engine in you and you feel like it’s always running, and you can’t turn it off except with medication,” Sandler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wsw__embed"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD has been called the most commonly diagnosed mental health disorder in American children. More than 7 million children in the U.S. have been diagnosed. The disorder was once thought to be something that resolved as children became adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, experts say they believe that many people are not diagnosed as kids and that the disorder continues into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults with the condition talk about having trouble &lt;strong&gt;focusing&lt;/strong&gt; on immediate responsibilities and planning their time. Some say the disorder has led to problems in their personal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnoses have been rising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnoses have been increasing in both kids and adults. The recent government report also found adult ADHD was more common than earlier estimates had suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t had (federal) adult ADHD data in a long time,” said Angelika Claussen. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researcher was one of the study’s writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were signs of the rise, she added. Increasing demand for ADHD medication led to severe shortages after the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020. A 2023 study showed the rise in prescriptions, or doctors’ orders for such medication, was notable in adults — especially among women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD diagnoses and medication were increasing before the pandemic. This is partly because of a change in general diagnostic measures in 2013. Those changes expanded the definition of ADHD and reduced the number of signs, or symptoms, required for diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But cases really seemed to increase in 2020, when schools closed and many adults were forced to work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very difficult to focus when you are home and you have kids,” Claussen said. She said such conditions may have worsened ADHD symptoms in people with less severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How ADHD is diagnosed in adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say that it was long believed that ADHD was underdiagnosed in adults. Now, experts debate about whether it has become over-diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no blood or brain test for the disorder. Experts say it is diagnosed when symptoms cause ongoing problems in more than one area of life, and when those symptoms began in early childhood. Experts say the best way professionals diagnose ADHD is by getting careful histories from patients and from people who know them. They also might test a patient’s memory and ability to focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But getting an appointment with a mental health professional can take months. And assessments can cost thousands of dollars. Many people turn to family doctors. People also take online diagnostic tests, some of which are linked to health companies that &lt;strong&gt;prescribe&lt;/strong&gt; medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a wide &lt;strong&gt;variability&lt;/strong&gt; in this country in how people diagnose, how &lt;strong&gt;strict&lt;/strong&gt; they are, and who they diagnose,” said Margaret Sibley. She is psychologist at University of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Professional Society of ADHD and Related Disorders is preparing a set of diagnosis and treatment guidelines for American health professionals who treat adults. Sibley is leading the work on the guidelines, which the organization expects to release later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We spend a third of our lives asleep. And a quarter of our time asleep is spent dreaming. So, for the average person alive in 2022, with a life expectancy of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy"&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;, that clocks in at just over six years of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, given the central role that dreaming plays in our lives, we still know so little about why we dream, how the brain creates dreams, and importantly, what the significance of our dreams might be for our health – especially the health of our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 2022 study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet's&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt; journal&lt;/a&gt;, showed that our dreams can reveal a surprising amount of information about our brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, it showed that having frequent bad dreams and nightmares (bad dreams that make you wake up) during middle or older age, may be linked with an increased risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dementia/symptoms/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, I analyzed data from three large US studies of health and aging. These included over 600 people aged between 35 and 64, and 2,600 people aged 79 and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the participants were dementia-free at the start of the study and were followed for an average of nine years for the middle-aged group and five years for the older participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study (2002-12), the participants completed a range of questionnaires, including one which asked about how often they experienced bad dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg" alt="man in bed surrounded by hands" class="wp-image-143068 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands-600x325.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Frequent nightmares could be a sign of declining mental health. (Kirk Marsh/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I analyzed the data to find out whether participants with a higher frequency of nightmares at the beginning of the study were more likely to go on to experience cognitive decline (a fast decline in memory and thinking skills over time) and be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weekly nightmares&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that middle-aged participants who experienced nightmares every week, were four times more likely to experience cognitive decline (&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12704"&gt;a precursor to dementia)&lt;/a&gt; over the following decade, while the older participants were twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the connection between nightmares and future dementia was much stronger for men than for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, older men who had nightmares every week were five times more likely to develop dementia compared with older men reporting no bad dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In women, however, the increase in risk was only 41 percent. I found a very similar pattern in the middle-aged group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, these results suggest frequent nightmares may be one of the earliest signs of dementia, which can precede the development of memory and thinking problems by several years or even decades – especially in men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, it is also possible that having regular bad dreams and nightmares might even be a cause of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of this study, it is not possible to be certain which of these theories is correct (though I suspect it is the former).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, regardless of which theory turns out to be true – the major implication of the study remains the same, that is, that having regular bad dreams and nightmares during middle and older age may be linked to an increased risk of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that recurring nightmares are &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.7178"&gt;treatable&lt;/a&gt;. And the first-line medical treatment for nightmares has already been shown to decrease the build-up of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458012004666?via%3Dihub"&gt;abnormal proteins&lt;/a&gt; linked to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Illustration of yellow clumps on pink nerve cells" class="size-full wp-image-143082" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Abnormal clumps of amyloid-beta proteins are linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="153762" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3y9cbGY/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have also been &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.803220/full"&gt;case reports&lt;/a&gt; showing improvements in memory and thinking skills after treating nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that treating nightmares might help to slow cognitive decline and to prevent dementia from developing in some people. This will be an important avenue to explore in future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next steps for my research include investigating whether nightmares in young people might also be linked to increased dementia risk. This could help to determine whether nightmares cause dementia, or whether they are simply an early sign in some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also plan to investigate whether other dream characteristics, such as how often we remember our dreams and how vivid they are, might also help to determine how likely people are to develop dementia in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research might not only help to shed light on the relationship between dementia and dreaming, and provide new opportunities for earlier diagnoses – and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"&gt;earlier interventions&lt;/a&gt; – but it may also shed new light on the nature and function of the mysterious phenomenon that we call &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-do-we-dream/"&gt;dreaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/191016/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrer-policy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Researchers tracked brain activity in epilepsy patients with implanted electrodes and found that this region encodes pitch accents as meaningful linguistic signals, separate from word sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery challenges long-held assumptions that prosody processing occurs later in the brain and suggests that humans uniquely extract meaning from pitch variations. The findings could improve speech therapy, AI voice recognition, and our understanding of language disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Prosody Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; Heschl’s gyrus encodes pitch accents before higher speech centers process meaning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Human Ability:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike non-human primates, humans abstract pitch changes into meaningful language cues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-World Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; These insights could advance speech therapy, AI voice recognition, and linguistic research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve probably heard the phrase, “It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it,” and now, science backs it up. A first-of-its-kind study from Northwestern University’s School of Communication, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Wisconsin-Madison reveals a region of the brain, long known for early auditory processing, plays a far greater role in interpreting speech than previously understood. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multidisciplinary study being published Monday, March 3 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications &lt;/em&gt;found a brain region known as Heschl’s gyrus doesn’t just process sounds — it transforms subtle changes in pitch, known as prosody, into meaningful linguistic information that guides how humans understand emphasis, intent and focus in conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108010"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman talking." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The brain encoded pitch accents separately from the sounds that make up words. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists believed that all aspects of prosody were primarily processed in the superior temporal gyrus, a brain region known for speech perception. Bharath Chandrasekaran, the study’s co-principal investigator and professor and chair of the Roxelyn and Richard Pepper Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders at Northwestern, said the findings challenge long-held assumptions about how, where and the speed at which prosody is processed in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results redefine our understanding of the architecture of speech perception,” Chandrasekaran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve spent a few decades researching the nuances of how speech is abstracted in the brain, but this is the first study to investigate how subtle variations in pitch that also communicate meaning is processed in the brain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rare set of research participants &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chandrasekaran partnered with Dr. Taylor Abel, chief of pediatric neurosurgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine to study auditory information processing in 11 adolescent patients who were receiving neurosurgery treatment for severe epilepsy. They all had electrodes implanted deep in the cortex of the brain that is critical for key language function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically, communication and linguistics research rely on non-invasive recordings from the surface of the skin, which makes it accessible but not very precise,” Abel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A collaboration between neurosurgeon-scientists and neuroscientists, like ours, allowed us to collect high-quality recordings of brain activity that would not have been possible otherwise, and learn about the mechanisms of brain processing in a completely new way.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore how the brain deciphers the melody of speech, researchers worked with the rare group of patients who had electrodes implanted in their brains as part of epilepsy treatment. While these patients actively listened to an audiobook recording of “Alice in Wonderland,” scientists tracked activity in multiple brain regions in real time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What researchers found &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the intracerebral recordings from the electrodes deep in the patient’s brain, researchers noted the Heschl’s gyrus section processed subtle changes in voice pitch — not just as sound, but as meaningful linguistic units. The brain encoded pitch accents separately from the sounds that make up words. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study challenges the long-standing assumptions how and where the brain picks up on the natural melody in speech — those subtle pitch changes that help convey meaning and intent,” said G. Nike Gnanataja of UW-Madison’s Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders and co-first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though these pitch patterns vary each time we speak, our brains create stable representations to understand them.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gnanataja says the research also revealed that the hidden layer of meaning carried by prosodic contours — the rise and fall of speech — is encoded much earlier in auditory processing than previously thought.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar research was conducted in non-human primates, but researchers found those brains lacked this abstraction, despite processing the same acoustic cues.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By unlocking the hidden layer of speech, Chandrasekaran and his team discovered how the brain processes pitch accents, revealing profound implications for various fields.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings could transform speech rehabilitation, AI-powered voice assistants, and our understanding of what makes human communication unique,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding early prosodic processing could lead to new interventions for speech and language disorders, such as autism, dysprosody in patients who have had a stroke, and language-based learning differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the unique role of linguistic experience in human communication, as non-human primates lack the ability to process pitch accents as abstract categories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these findings could significantly enhance AI-driven voice recognition systems by enabling them to better handle prosody, bringing natural language processing closer to mimicking human speech perception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research is supported by NIH grant 5R01DC13315-11 awarded by the National Institute of Health and is a product of an ongoing research project titled “Cortical contributions to frequency-following response generation and modulation,” co-principal investigators Bharath Chandrasekaran, Taylor Abel, Srivatsun Sadagopan, Tobias Teichert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was also supported by NIH grant R21DC019217-01A1 awarded to Taylor Abel; and the Vice-Chancellors Research and Graduate Education, and College of Letters and Sciences UW Madison Funds to G.

In the non-human primate, pitch accents were not abstractly encoded, despite robust spectrotemporal processing, highlighting the role of experience in shaping abstract representations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings emphasize a key role for the HG in early prosodic abstraction and advance our understanding of human speech processing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 21:42:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5GM0w3RG1iZzdnYjhVMXNmWkdidjlQMUFTT2NlQk9kNzNDQjFjcThIYjc1VGxpenRPVUM4SnVJeFh1bnFLRXFwYVRaOWZmZk1qbWdibFVtZWE0ekQ2SnJKN3ZCUWxySjNx</guid></item><item><title>The number of foods to feed your 9-month-old baby to slash allergy risk by 45% - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxOM3BBa1lRRHhid2ZVLVg5aHhrZFN1aVdLV21xTnR6dHllRlhzenpTUGNMTzBLb3pIZk1pMnh5Mnh6R3NNaFBOVGxrMUNFcHRvYXE5RFFuaUN2N0RjNlhCZGRSTS1jVGhhbjVzTGdNdG5raHpycEM4UFZqdHlGaHhxdlpUdS0wSFQtODV5bXBWb3lEUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Food allergies now affect approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/school-health-conditions/food-allergies/index.html#:~:text=Why%20it's%20an%20issue,department%20for%20food%20allergy%20reactions." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1 in 13 children&lt;/a&gt; in the US, representing an increase of 50% in the prevalence of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/19/health/drug-to-treat-severe-food-allergies-including-nuts-gets-fda-approval/"&gt;food allergies&lt;/a&gt; between 1997 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts attribute the rise to several factors, including a shift to more refined diets, vitamin D deficiencies due to a lack of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/27/health/4-common-medications-that-can-increase-skin-cancer-risk/"&gt;sun exposure&lt;/a&gt; and the “hygiene hypothesis” — which posits that our cleaner contemporary environment exposes children to fewer microbes, causing their immune system to overreact to certain foods. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pai.70035"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; performed in Sweden and published in the journal Pediatric Allergy and Immunology adds to a growing body of research that suggests one of the factors may be the delayed introduction of allergenic foods. &lt;/p&gt;

1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;At 18 months, 100 of the children in the study were diagnosed with a food allergy, the most common ones being cow’s milk and eggs.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed the data of 2,060 babies and found that introducing them to a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/08/health/twins-tried-different-diets-for-12-weeks-one-had-more-energy/"&gt;diverse diet&lt;/a&gt; — categorized as consisting of 13 or 14 different foods — at 9 months of age was associated with a 45% decrease in the risk of food allergies by the time the infant reached 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the study suggests that the same protective effect does not seem to occur when implementing a diverse diet at an earlier age, such as 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;This association held strong even after adjusting for factors like family history of allergies, breastfeeding duration and the mother’s education levels — although the researchers noted that “children with a history of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/06/health/salt-may-increase-your-risk-for-dry-itchy-skin-by-22-study/"&gt;eczema&lt;/a&gt; may benefit the most from eating a diverse diet early in life for food allergy prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were obtained by asking parents to fill out a questionnaire that measured their infant’s diet diversity at 6 and 9 months based on how often they consumed 14 foods, including six that are common allergies: wheat, egg, fish, dairy, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/health/a-handful-of-this-snack-can-boost-mood-and-reduce-cancer-risk/"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt; (especially peanuts) and soy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At 18 months, 100 of the children in the study were diagnosed with a food allergy, the most common ones being cow’s milk (69 cases) and eggs (35 cases). &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While food allergies are predominantly genetic, this study indicates that a baby’s diet at 9 months could also have a significant impact on their likelihood of developing food allergies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Repeated exposure to foods in infancy is important both for tolerance development and maintenance,” the researchers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One could assume that frequent consumption of plant-based foods including fruit, vegetables, and legumes which are rich in fiber and vitamins are especially important for reducing food allergy risk, in line with existing guidelines,” they concluded.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These findings align with previous studies emphasizing the benefits of early introduction of allergenic foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, a &lt;a href="https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2019.5780?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; found that introducing peanut-containing foods to babies between 4 to 6 months of age was associated with a reduced risk of peanut allergy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/29/health/introducing-peanuts-early-reduces-kids-allergy-risk-study/"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; replicated those findings last year, finding that kids who ate peanuts as a paste or puree until age 5 were 71% less likely to develop a peanut allergy than those who didn’t have peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1555415523001708"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; “supports that the method and timing of food introduction can impact the likelihood of developing an allergy or sensitivity to the food.”&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;A Dare County resident had
to sacrifice their backyard chickens after the birds tested positive for the
bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said Monday that wild birds
that carry the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, known commonly as bird
flu, can infect domesticated birds. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;This type of HPAI virus is
considered a low risk to people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control. However, it is highly contagious to other birds. The virus is also not
considered a food safety threat and infected birds do not enter the food
supply. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It is likely that HPAI remains in our
resident wild bird population and in migratory waterfowl, so reports of
positive backyard flocks will likely happen on occasion,” said Dr. Mike Martin,
state veterinarian. “I encourage our commercial and backyard flock owners to
continue to follow strict biosecurity measures and if your flock is
experiencing a sudden higher-than-normal mortality rate, report it right away
to your local veterinarian or to the N.C. Department of Agriculture Veterinary
Division at 919-707-3250.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state said the flock of chickens
that tested positive for bird was euthanized to prevent its spread.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In February, a &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/bird-flu-detected-wake-county-owl-2025/"&gt;great horned owl tested positive for bird flu in Wake County&lt;/a&gt;, according to the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. A spokesperson for the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission confirmed the case and said one hawk and multiple geese were found dead in the same area. It marked the first case of bird flu detected in Wake County since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In January, the state said bird flu
was found in two commercial turkey operations in Sampson County and a layer
operation in Hyde County. &lt;/p&gt;

As of late February, more than 166 million birds had been slaughtered
nationwide to limit the virus' spread when cases are found. Most were
egg-laying chickens.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis is a disease that results when the immune system mistakenly attacks the brain and spinal cord. It affects &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000007035"&gt;nearly one million people in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and over &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458520970841"&gt;2.8 million worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. While genetics play a role in the risk of developing multiple sclerosis, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.50862"&gt;environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; such as diet, infectious disease and gut health are major contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The environment plays a key role in determining who develops multiple sclerosis, and this is evident from twin studies. Among identical twins who share 100% of their genes, one twin has a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm198612253152603"&gt;roughly 25% chance&lt;/a&gt; of developing MS if the other twin has the disease. For fraternal twins who share 50% of their genes, this rate drops to around 2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long suspected that gut bacteria may influence a person’s risk of developing multiple sclerosis. But studies so far have had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2024.2387794"&gt;inconsistent findings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address these inconsistencies, my colleagues and I used what researchers call a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/podcasts/neuro-pathways/bedside-to-bench-to-bedside-the-keys-to-successful-collaboration-in-neuroscience-research"&gt;bedside-to-bench-to-bedside&lt;/a&gt; approach: starting with samples from patients with multiple sclerosis, conducting lab experiments on these samples, then confirming our findings in patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our newly published research, we found that the ratio of two bacteria in the gut can &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413953122"&gt;predict multiple sclerosis severity&lt;/a&gt; in patients, highlighting the importance of the microbiome and gut health in this disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/652207/original/file-20250228-38-sko32o.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; is commonly found in the human gut microbiome.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.13410"&gt;Zhang et al/Microbial Biotechnology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bedside to bench&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we analyzed the chemical and bacterial gut composition of patients with multiple sclerosis, confirming that they had gut inflammation and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2024.2387794"&gt;different types of gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; compared with people without multiple sclerosis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we showed that a group of bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Blautia&lt;/em&gt; was more common in multiple sclerosis patients, while &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007114519000680"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prevotella&lt;/em&gt;, a bacterial species&lt;/a&gt; consistently linked to a healthy gut, was found in lower amounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a separate experiment in mice, we observed that the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413953122"&gt;balance between two gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt;, was critical in distinguishing mice with or without multiple sclerosis-like disease. Mice with multiple sclerosis-like symptoms had increased levels of &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; and decreased levels of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; in their stool or gut lining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bench to bedside&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore this further, we treated mice with antibiotics to remove all their gut bacteria. Then, we gave either &lt;em&gt;Blautia&lt;/em&gt;, which was higher in multiple sclerosis patients; &lt;em&gt;Prevotella&lt;/em&gt;, which was more common in healthy patients; or a control bacteria, &lt;em&gt;Phocaeicola&lt;/em&gt;, which is found in patients with and without multiple sclerosis. We found that mice with &lt;em&gt;Blautia&lt;/em&gt; developed more gut inflammation and &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413953122"&gt;worse multiple sclerosis-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before symptoms appeared, these mice had low levels of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and high levels of &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt;. This suggested that an imbalance between these two bacteria might not just be a sign of disease, but could actually &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413953122"&gt;predict how severe&lt;/a&gt; it will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then examined whether this same imbalance appeared in people. We measured the ratio of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium adolescentis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; in samples from multiple sclerosis patients in Iowa and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.08.021"&gt;participants in a study&lt;/a&gt; spanning the U.S., Latin America and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings were consistent: Patients with multiple sclerosis had a lower ratio of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt;. This imbalance was not only linked to having multiple sclerosis but also with worse disability, making it a stronger predictor of disease severity than any single type of bacteria alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/652204/original/file-20250228-32-hj7pci.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; both produces and consumes mucin, a glycoprotein that protects the gut lining.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/92803392@N02/9511080418"&gt;Paola Mattarelli and Monica Modesto/Katz Lab via Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-NC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How ‘good’ bacteria can become harmful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting findings from our study was that normally beneficial bacteria can turn harmful in multiple sclerosis. &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; is usually considered a helpful bacterium, but it became problematic in patients with multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A previous study in mice showed a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2022.2127446"&gt;similar pattern&lt;/a&gt;: Mice with severe disease had a lower &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-to-&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; ratio. In that study, mice fed a diet rich in phytoestrogens – chemicals structurally similar to human estrogen that need to be broken down by bacteria for beneficial health effects – developed milder disease than those on a diet without phytoestrogens. Previously we have shown that people with multiple sclerosis lack gut bacteria that can metabolize phytoestrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the precise mechanisms behind the link between the &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-to- &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; ratio and multiple sclerosis is unknown, researchers have a theory. Both types of bacteria consume &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/slime-is-all-around-and-inside-you-new-research-on-its-origins-offers-insight-into-genetic-evolution-189278"&gt;mucin, a substance&lt;/a&gt; that protects the gut lining. However, &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; both &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11819-z"&gt;eats and produces mucin&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; only consumes it. When &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; levels drop, such as during inflammation, &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; overconsumes mucin and weakens the gut lining. This process can trigger more inflammation and potentially contribute to the progression of multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our finding that the &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-to-&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; ratio may be a key marker for multiple sclerosis severity could help improve diagnosis and treatment. It also highlights how losing beneficial gut bacteria can allow other gut bacteria to become harmful, though it is unclear whether changing levels of certain microbes can affect multiple sclerosis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While more research can help clarify the link between the gut microbiome and multiple sclerosis, these findings offer a promising new direction for understanding and treating this disease.&lt;/p&gt;

This sickness has killed over 60 people and sickened more than a thousand, and it is occurring at the same time as an Ebola outbreak in neighboring Uganda, as well as increasing political violence within the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Experts say that Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has stymied the response to this unidentified disease, delaying further investigations and containment efforts of additional disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Medical staff along the Uganda–DRC border have been terminated. Soldiers are everywhere. The laboratory built to deal with zoonotic diseases with US funding is empty,” says Tim Allen, a London School of Economics professor and tropical-disease-control expert on the ground at the border of Uganda and the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Nidhi Bouri, the former deputy assistant administrator for global health at USAID during the Joe Biden administration who previously led disease preparedness and response efforts, says the aid cuts have created a gap in the on-the-ground response. “We don’t have the in-country presence,” she says. USAID previously provided key infrastructure and support for disease surveillance and prevention; it worked in tandem with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on complementary tasks, Bouri says. “Once a pathogen is identified, USAID was able to, historically, identify rapid ways to mitigate further spread.” By abruptly gutting USAID, the Donald Trump administration has created a vacuum that other agencies will struggle to completely fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The US State Department did not respond to requests for comment. “CDC is monitoring the situation closely and engaging with DRC officials on what support the agency can offer,” says Centers for Disease Control spokesperson Melissa Dibble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While the disease in the DRC is still officially unidentified, there are some conflicting theories emerging about its cause. The World Health Organization &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mystery-disease-congo-what-we-know/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mystery-disease-congo-what-we-know/"}' href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mystery-disease-congo-what-we-know/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now suspects&lt;/a&gt; that the unidentified illness could in fact be a mass-poisoning incident rather than a virus, with contaminated water as a likely source. Or, if it is a virus, it may not be novel at all; last year in the DRC, an outbreak of an unknown illness was discovered to be respiratory infections &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON547"&gt;combined with malaria&lt;/a&gt;. Local health officials, including experts at the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q94_f039QKM"&gt;hypothesize&lt;/a&gt; that this may be the case again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In 2024, the United States Congress &lt;a data-offer-url="https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/President%E2%80%99s%20Malaria%20Initiative%20in%20Africa%20USAID%20Did%20Not%20Implement%20Its%20Strategy%20to%20Prioritize%20High-Burden%20Countries%20%28Task%20No.%20441M0322%29.pdf" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/President%E2%80%99s%20Malaria%20Initiative%20in%20Africa%20USAID%20Did%20Not%20Implement%20Its%20Strategy%20to%20Prioritize%20High-Burden%20Countries%20%28Task%20No.%20441M0322%29.pdf"}' href="https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/President%E2%80%99s%20Malaria%20Initiative%20in%20Africa%20USAID%20Did%20Not%20Implement%20Its%20Strategy%20to%20Prioritize%20High-Burden%20Countries%20%28Task%20No.%20441M0322%29.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;appropriated&lt;/a&gt; $795 million for malaria control, most of which was intended to serve sub-Saharan Africa, which weathers the bulk of global malaria infections.

stimuli such as their doctor talking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/columbia-university/index.html" id="mol-66acc6d0-f861-11ef-8b5c-1b3d67a7ff59" class=""&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; analyzed 226 recent comatose patients, observing a third displayed the unique bursts - a phenomenon scientists call 'sleep spindles.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain circuits that&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14442711/The-five-clues-afterlife-really-DOES-exist.html"&gt; are fundamental for consciousness&lt;/a&gt; are also key to how we sleep, the Columbia team explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moreover, scientists said comatose patients with this type of 'hidden consciousness' showed signs they were already on the road to recovery from their brain injuries and many dealt with fewer disabilities later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among those displaying sleep spindles, 76 percent showed some level of consciousness before leaving the hospital and over 40 percent recovered some of their neurological function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Jan Claassen, an associate professor of neurology, said that this discovery provides new hope for families with critically injured loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're at an exciting crossroad in neurocritical care where we know that many patients appear to be unconscious, but some are recovering without our knowledge,' said Claassen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're starting to lift the lid a little bit and find some signs of recovery as it's happening,' the lead study author continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists have discovered unique signals in the sleep patterns of comatose patients, revealing that they have a 'hidden' level of consciousness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The connection between certain brain circuits and sleep is&lt;span&gt; important for explaining a condition called cognitive motor dissociation, where unconscious patients still show evidence of consciousness during brain scans but have no detectable ability to respond to outside stimuli - like someone talking to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Until now, scientists have mainly focused on EEG recordings to tell if comatose patients were still conscious in some way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These recordings test to detect abnormalities in brain waves, based on how well the person undergoing the EEG responds to a doctor's instructions, such as opening and closing their hand. However, Claassen noted that these recordings can lead to false-negative results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, the Columbia team shifted their focus to tracking the activity present in brain wave patterns during normal sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The electrical activity during sleep looks relatively chaotic, and then occasionally in some patients, these very organized, fast frequencies appear,' Claassen explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The associate professor noted that these unique bursts in the middle of all that chaos are the sleep spindles displaying hidden consciousness inside the comatose mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Spindles happen normally during sleep and they're showing some level of organization in the brain, suggesting circuits between the thalamus and cortex needed for consciousness are intact,' Claassen detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thalamus acts like your brain's information relay station, while the cortex contributes to higher brain functions like memory, thinking, learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The brain activity are sleep spindles and researchers said it shows unconscious patients can still hear and understand what is happing around them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22652-thalamus"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, all of the information coming in from your body's senses (except smell) has to be processed by the thalamus before it's sent to the brain's cortex for interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the patients in Claassen's study, the spindles show that they're still hearing people talk and feel them squeeze their hand, and those sensations are still traveling to the brain's cortex where the mind reacts to what's happening - even if people sitting next to them can't see a noticeable reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the study, researchers examined the overnight EEG recordings of 226 comatose patients. This group also underwent more complex testing for cognitive motor dissociation. The team noted that all of these injuries were recent and their findings likely don't apply to those with long-term disorders causing unconsciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03578-x"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; focused specifically on sleep among patients in a coma after a recent brain injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results revealed that 87 patients displayed signs of both sleep spindles and cognitive motor dissociation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with clear signs of the sleep spindles in their brain waves were significantly more likely to regain consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were also more likely recover from their severe brain injury with only minor neurological deficits or a moderate disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, just 19 of the 139 comatose patients who did not experience sleep spindles or cognitive motor dissociation regained any level of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I see these spindles as a way to direct more sophisticated testing to the patients most likely to benefit,' Claassen said. 'The techniques are not ready for use in clinical practice yet, but this is something that we're actively working on right now.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lead study author added their study doesn't prove that inducing sleep spindles could help brain injury patients regain consciousness, but there are signs that moving these patients to areas which promote better sleep could improve their chances of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you think about the ICU environment, it is rather disruptive for a good night's sleep. There is noise everywhere, alarms going off, clinicians touching them, 24/7. This is all for a good reason, but it's hard to sleep in that environment,' Claassen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 19:17:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNMXpDWi1mTDNWUlRvWVBDc0RkX2hKUTAzanQwQkJYc010dmJIa0J4Y25maUtDSzFOb0x6eWZQbndDNGJ5eDNuUHhRX3pYYlVGY0pPd0VZek9mUnF4ekFVbGFoajFvRnhLSEJPb2Qtb3RTTHdHSzhza19RVGJLUVJ0cXNnV3JzUTd6R1lKTkxYTjQ3VFFLMnA1WUIyWWpFZXNGc25qa2JDZ9IBrAFBVV95cUxNMmlJS1A2c1lvUDA1OHV1ZlgwTm5JUW9zZzJoczdCYkV1ZDdxa0NpRFlFZGJtTlZVRURPcmFuUHF3cFJTb3VkSExWdkEtaGg4WFdDdGpXLTRERWVkR3FULVdISURLWFZVYzFWUUxzSjd1alR0cXpiWkw2T0hoZTlic2VFelo3QTc2TTdRdFdZelZnYS1pYWNOTVA3Tk9NZ0pkR2cxMHdaVnlVM1M0</guid></item><item><title>Woman notices unusual symptom after a manicure... it saved her life - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxQYUh4dGtzeG5GMkZkS0pQaHZGMHBZM3YyWTR1LXRqVTJBTzhZcnV2LVYyaFdCQjRnSW10bndGWUJkLUpnUmxya1Rjc2xQak1qVmdUQ1ZzRXZ3c3Vna011aXdtMUZUNC0wbElVN1p3MFU2UWVFUTNUVV9mSWZQb1ZUNUc5czVBTFB3elE3VDE1aFNlbGdEUFZ6OFF4VjNRTGkycEJKUVZB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9ZQ0I2bVFJcnBDLU04YmNiZGtsYUtjakV3U0ZQTHNMNW13ZjdPdHJ3a3VjeXc2cXdZNl9ST2szOUFOWldhT1cyQ1VXLXFWN2hNS2w1UVYxd3hUM1lKbktkaTJ1bHlZVHJyNFF0UlVIeVZZa1JUSTZJdTFBcTd1S0xUSEFWM3NDd0JQZXNoOFdYc3d5Y3FLdnpMTm5qYVlKUktCNXhQWXBDQ0NuQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ohio/index.html" id="mol-2795e580-f84d-11ef-9b24-a7fd1b4ae0a6"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; mother-of-two made a life-saving discovery after she noticed black lines on her thumb while at a nail appointment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Michelle Tagliamonte, 58, first noticed the faint lines running across her right thumb in September 2024 shortly before getting monthly  manicure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The health coach and nutrition educator recalled: 'The first time I noticed it [the mark] was in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I usually get my nails done every four weeks so I don't know how long it has been there but my nails grow pretty quickly because I have really good nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It could have been in there for six months, it could have been in there for longer, I have no idea.

This stage is when the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-2ce083a0-f853-11ef-9b24-a7fd1b4ae0a6" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells are contained just to the epidermis - the very outer layer of the skin - and have not yet moved into the deeper layers of skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stage zero melanoma, diagnosed in about 89,000 people in 2023, is considered a non-invasive cancer, meaning it has spread to other tissues.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With a very high survival rate - 98 percent - the cancerous area is removed surgically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, treatments such as  chemotherapy are not required, but if not cured but surgery, some doctors may suggest undergoing radiation therapy to kill the cancerous cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On January 17, Tagliamonte underwent a four-hour operation during which her right thumbnail was removed and a plastic surgeon took a skin graft from the bottom of her thumb to place over the bone and tendon where her missing nail now left them exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was left with a large incision and stitches running down the side of her hand following surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She first noticed the faint lines running across her right thumb in September 2024. Images show her thumb bloodied with a large incision and stitches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On January 17, Tagliamonte underwent a four-hour operation to remove the cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: '&lt;span&gt;What the dermatologist was seeing was discoloration at the base of my thumb nail and whatever was causing this black line in my nail was coming from inside the growth plate down from inside my nail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The melanoma was in the growth plate [in my thumb] down to my first knuckle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is where they had to cut out and they had to create a skin graft so when they had to dig out the melanoma, the bone and the tendon was exposed so they had to put some flesh back in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The skin graft was pretty invasive. I will never have a thumb nail ever again but if I had let it go, I might have lost the tip of my thumb or worse so I am very grateful and it is healing well.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She will now be left without a right thumbnail for life but says there is no permanent nerve damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Tagliamonte said: 'I was more worried about what they were going to have to do to get rid of it and the surgery itself. This was scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Since surgery], there is no permanent nerve damage. I have a scar that runs down my thumb and the skin is still healing and new skin is forming under the skin graft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She will now be left without a right thumbnail for life  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She has since spent her time healing and is now urging others to trust their own intuition and get themselves checked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm right-handed so the worst part was not being able to use this hand. For the first couple of weeks I couldn't button my own pants or put on my own bra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has since spent her time healing and is now urging others to trust their own intuition and get themselves checked if they notice any changes in their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am very grateful that I caught it at stage zero and it was localized. I think it's just a matter of being diligent to get myself checked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would just say don't take anything for granted. I would definitely say that if you see something that is odd or different, listen to your own intuition and get it checked out,' she gratefully said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have warned of the dangers of the use of UV light used to seal some nail polish during professional manicures, saying it can potentially increase the risk of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some nail lamps are called 'UV' lamps and some are called LED lamps, both emit UV radiation that produce UVA rays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excessive exposure to UV rays can damage the DNA in skin cells, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and the development of tumors, including melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While both UVA and UVB rays contribute to skin cancer, with UVB being more directly linked to sunburn while UVA can penetrate deeper into the skin and contribute to long-term damage and aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 19:11:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQYUh4dGtzeG5GMkZkS0pQaHZGMHBZM3YyWTR1LXRqVTJBTzhZcnV2LVYyaFdCQjRnSW10bndGWUJkLUpnUmxya1Rjc2xQak1qVmdUQ1ZzRXZ3c3Vna011aXdtMUZUNC0wbElVN1p3MFU2UWVFUTNUVV9mSWZQb1ZUNUc5czVBTFB3elE3VDE1aFNlbGdEUFZ6OFF4VjNRTGkycEJKUVZB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9ZQ0I2bVFJcnBDLU04YmNiZGtsYUtjakV3U0ZQTHNMNW13ZjdPdHJ3a3VjeXc2cXdZNl9ST2szOUFOWldhT1cyQ1VXLXFWN2hNS2w1UVYxd3hUM1lKbktkaTJ1bHlZVHJyNFF0UlVIeVZZa1JUSTZJdTFBcTd1S0xUSEFWM3NDd0JQZXNoOFdYc3d5Y3FLdnpMTm5qYVlKUktCNXhQWXBDQ0NuQQ</guid></item><item><title>75 Extremely Rare Mind-Blowing Pictures I Found Last Month That Might Just Completely And Totally Change Your Perspective On The World - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTFA2WmtpM2JPaXNXemZRZV9FTzdQX3ByZmFSY2cwcDVrdnE5SzNybTlpVks0eFotYkVEYUdKZ2NqV21GanZDQkdWQ21qOVBzNmVZbnhZVVc0UmVzdFM3cnhnWWF4SU1UUWFKRFpGMkhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz__description

But there’s nothing inherently unsafe about genetically modified crops. What should give you pause, instead, is the potential risk of herbicide exposure — which can be an indirect result of modern GMO farming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AVW7GYNRVNBW3PBLZHT25YNJCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-united-states" target="_blank"&gt;most commonly grown&lt;/a&gt; GMO crops in the United States are soy and corn that are resistant to the herbicide glyphosate, which the International Agency for Research on Cancer has labeled a probable &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(15)70134-8/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;human carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L2BXJHE3R5GBFIIPA3UXP4JIFU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Several studies have shown that consuming GMOs is not associated with elevated health risks, including cancer. But glyphosate use has &lt;a href="https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-016-0070-0" target="_blank"&gt;risen dramatically&lt;/a&gt; in the United States since the 1990s, and we lack long-term epidemiological data about what this may — or may not — mean for our health. There is also some emerging data regarding glyphosate exposure, especially among younger children, worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RJJBTYOYOVGKZEASGFO5SDFWTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As we take into account what we do know, here’s my advice: GMOs are likely fine for adults to consume, especially if you minimize ultra-processed foods, which are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/05/08/ultraprocessed-junk-food-health-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;generally linked&lt;/a&gt; to adverse health outcomes and are a common source of GMO corn and soy. For pregnant women and young children, it would be very reasonable to minimize consuming GMOs and ultra-processed foods whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="6N22GIGFJNFMBPL4T6EPH7II5A" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="6N22GIGFJNFMBPL4T6EPH7II5A"&gt;What are GMOs?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MXKTOIB2MREQJJMFUQ3CPLPLBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A GMO is an organism, such as a crop, whose genes have been selected for a superior trait. A GMO is not a modern concept. Farmers have been selectively breeding plants chosen for desired traits for thousands of years. The &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2201327119" target="_blank"&gt;entire field of Mendelian genetics&lt;/a&gt; was born from experiments crossbreeding peas to learn about gene inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3PANSPR3INA7LNJRQW57RYXJLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For instance, have you ever found it odd that an eggplant, that large deep-purple blob, was named for an egg? It was selectively bred this way. The common &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/18/fruits-and-vegetables-used-to-look-so-different-you-might-not-even-recognize-them/" target="_blank"&gt;eggplants of centuries ago&lt;/a&gt; were actually more like small white ovals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U4I76ZWSRZANVO3ANS2XDNYEDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Of course, our modern techniques are very different: GMOs may undergo an accelerated process of gene engineering in a laboratory to insert a new gene from another organism into the DNA. Today, the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado9340?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank"&gt;most common traits&lt;/a&gt; that have been widely selected in GMOs are tolerance to herbicides and insect resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J5JJP4SKRZAI5LYQ5PSJZFHOB4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;With these GMOs, rather than having to rely heavily on mechanical weeding, farmers have used increasingly larger amounts of herbicides that don’t harm their crops. As a result, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38073334/" target="_blank"&gt;measurable quantities&lt;/a&gt; of herbicides like glyphosate have been detected in GMO grains intended for our food, animal feeds and in some areas’ drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="H6BEJU7HNZE5HKVNJ7JYI352UM" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="H6BEJU7HNZE5HKVNJ7JYI352UM"&gt;What are the health risks with GMOs?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YULCYOM5EVHAFF3KP66LJ6O7KM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4866614/" target="_blank"&gt;Human studies&lt;/a&gt; that have linked glyphosate to cancers like Hodgkin’s lymphoma predominantly evaluated farmers with high levels of occupational exposure, not people exposed via GMO consumption in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BT6ZOOARB5BDBHLHGUJEIM6RTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The National Academies of Medicine &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/23395/chapter/1" target="_blank"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; over 900 studies in 2016 on GMOs and did not find any evidence of elevated health risks, including cancer.

A large &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39808655/" target="_blank"&gt;retrospective study&lt;/a&gt; published this January in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) looked at U.S.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;rural birth records between 1990 and 2013. Researchers from the University of Oregon found that babies with higher glyphosate exposure, particularly in the rural South and Midwest, were more likely to be born with lower birth weights — a change that they found occurred around the rollout of GMOs after accounting for confounders like use of other pesticides, local income, employment rates and demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="W55QPVDPQVBIZFC7RPYOAURABQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The prospective studies are small and limited, but the findings still warrant pause: A 2021 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34009015/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 250 pregnant women in Puerto Rico — the largest &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8312484/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of its kind — found that prenatal exposure to glyphosate (measured objectively in urine samples) was associated with a 35 percent increased odds of preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="4JPC3XCUZVD4HIJCK65H2W3TMQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="4JPC3XCUZVD4HIJCK65H2W3TMQ"&gt;What crops are allowed to be GMO?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WW75K3YBCNEQJD5TBJ2HZ6QI6M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;GMOs are not as ubiquitous as many think.

You see, &lt;strong&gt;your gut is filled with trillions of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes that feed on the food you put in your body. If they’re fed well, that can be a boon for your overall health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The gut microbiome is crucial for overall well-being due to several functions like the development of the immune system, human metabolism and even cognitive function,” says &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/alma-simmons" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alma Simmons;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alma Simmons&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, LD, CDCES, a registered dietitian nutritionist at &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;. “One of the most important functions of the microbiota is to protect the intestine against colonization by exogenous pathogens and potentially harmful microorganisms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, not every food is good for your gut and the microbes that live within it. “Gas, bloating, cramping, diarrhea and constipation are no fun,” says &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/anish-sheth" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anish A.

Plus, “intestinal cramping and diarrhea can occur in those with fructose intolerance,” says Dr. Sheth. The interesting thing about sugar is that it's often hiding in foods you may not suspect such as condiments, granola, jarred sauces and flavored yogurts, so it's important to read labels so you're aware of how much sugar you're really eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Photo by Cathy Scola&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fried foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dishes like the fish and chips you love at the local diner or funnel cakes at the county fair tend to be high in unhealthy fats.

And while insulin does not directly interact with caffeine, it can still clash with your morning coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's more like, when you drink coffee, it increases your blood sugar, especially if there's cream and sugar in it too,' Dr Ngo-Hamilton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your blood sugar will spike, and that is making your medication less effective.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, drinking anything with caffeine can increase insulin and blood sugar levels, according to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/27/8/2047/23381/Caffeine-Impairs-Glucose-Metabolism-in-Type-2"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from the American Diabetes Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to insulin, Dr Ngo-Hamilton said people should also be mindful of the blood sugar drug metformin, which is taken by over 20 million Americans, according to the latest available data from 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ngo-Hamilton recommended keeping track of your blood sugar to determine if you should drink coffee with your medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Antibiotics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotics are prescribed for a wide variety of infections, with the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-979a8d90-4b50-11ef-92e4-174ea717279c"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; estimating that more than230 million such prescriptions were written in 2022 alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, these drugs can inhibit the metabolism of caffeine, leading to increased caffeine levels in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bourgeois specifically pointed to ciprofloxacin, also known as Cipro, which is typically used for bacterial infections such as UTIs and bladder infections, infectious diarrhea, and sinus infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As with cold and allergy meds, 'this antibiotic can inhibit the metabolism of caffeine, leading to increased caffeine levels in the blood,' she warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And just like with OTC meds, taking this drug with coffee could lead to a racing heart and feeling jittery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Blood thinners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Warfarin is the oldest and most popular blood thinner in America. However, taking it with coffee could lead to excessive bleeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A survey by the National Blood Clot Alliance suggested that eight million Americans &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14185895/blood-clot-drug-ticagrelor-brilinta-death-strokes-heart-attack.html"&gt;take blood thinners, which are used to prevent blood clots&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warfarin is both the oldest and most common, accounting for about a quarter of US blood thinner prescriptions, according to the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ngo-Hamilton said caffeine can inhibit the breakdown of blood thinners, leading to more of the drug lingering in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is particularly dangerous because having too much of the drug could result in excessive bleeding, even from minor injuries like a paper cut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For warfarin specifically, Dr Ngo-Hamilton recommends waiting 'at least six to eight hours' after taking the medication to have some coffee since there is 'a very significant drug interaction between warfarin and caffeine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newer blood thinners like Eliuis should not cause the these interactions, she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Blood pressure medications &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy estimated that 117 million prescriptions for beta blockers have been doled out to 26 million Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are meant to lower blood pressure and block the effects of the hormone epinephrine, or adrenaline. This helps improve blood flow and lower heart rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Beta blockers work to reduce your heart rate so that your heart doesn't have to work as hard,' Dr Ngo-Hamilton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But then when you drink coffee, or any caffeinated beverages, it increases your heart rate and ultimately increases your blood pressure. This is not a direct drug interaction, but it's more like counteracting the beta blocker.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She suggested taking these medications two hours before or four hours after a cup of coffee or other caffeinated drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Thyroid medications &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levothyroxine, which is designed to treat an underactive thyroid - hypothyroidism - is one of America's most prescribed drugs, totaling 23 million prescriptions per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Ngo-Hamilton cautioned that taking these drugs with any type of food or water - coffee included - can reduce the amount of medication absorbed by the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7397437/"&gt;review from 2020&lt;/a&gt; found that caffeine reduced this absorption rate by as much as 50 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr William Franklin, founder and medical director of &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.victorymed.com/"&gt;Victory Medical&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, told the Daily Mail that people with levothyroxine prescriptions should take the drug 'on an empty stomach with water and wait 30 to 60 minutes before having caffeine'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Alzheimer's medications &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts estimated that one in 10 US adults over the age of 65 have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medications to treat symptoms, called cholinesterase inhibitors, prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine - a chemical that helps with memory formation and thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking these drugs with coffee tightens the blood-brain barrier, making it more difficult for the medication to reach the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultimately, it reduces the effectiveness,' Dr Ngo-Hamilton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She pointed to Donepezil and Rivastigmine as the most likely culprits to cause this effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also noted that someone on these drugs should take them two hours before or four hours after coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Osteoporosis medications &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Taking osteoporosis drugs like risendronate and ibandronate with coffee could increase the risk of fractures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Osteoporosis is where bones become weak or brittle over time, causing even minor stressors like coughing to fracture them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC estimated that 10million Americans aged over 50 live with the condition and take medications like risendronate and ibandronate to slow bone breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, as with thyroid medications, taking these drugs with coffee can stop them being properly absorbed by the body, making them less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ngo-Hamilton recommended waiting about two hours after taking the medication to drink coffee or eat food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Asthma medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the 25 million Americans living with asthma rely on bronchodilators, a class of prescription medications that relax and widen the airways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, mixing bronchodilators such as aminophylline and theophylline with coffee could exacerbate the side effects of these drugs - like irritability and restlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're new on the medication, wait and see how you're doing on the medication first before you start drinking coffee because it can worsen the side effects,' Dr Ngo-Hamilton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you do still want to drink coffee, she suggested taking these medications four hours before or after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;ADHD medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Close to one in 10 Americans under the age of 17 have been diagnosed with ADHD, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10764003/Adult-ADHD-sufferers-10-likely-employed-prescription-medication.html"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, and about 41million prescriptions have been doled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These drugs help regulate neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine to improve focus, attention and impulse control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking drugs such as Adderall and Ritalin with coffee could make them less effective and lead to increased hyperactivity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Both ADHD medications and caffeine are stimulants. When combined, they can amplify each other’s effects, leading to overstimulation,' Dr Bourgeois said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Antipsychotics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly four million Americans take some form of antipsychotic medication, according to the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the most common examples include clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, which are typically prescribed for severe mention health conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These work by regulating neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin to mitigate symptoms that include hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Ngo-Hamilton warned that coffee can reduce how much of the medication is absorbed by the body. And if a person is suffering from mania, the drugs would then be unable to pull them out of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recommended staying away from coffee altogether if a patient is having a manic episode.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s quite clear it affirms that MMR vaccines are critical for protecting not only ourselves, but our broader community, and I’d like to see more of that,” said Nuzzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, the decision to get vaccinated has to do with protecting the vulnerable people in their community, and, for others, it’s to protect themselves, said Nuzzo.

The time for this messaging was on the day we lost a child to this vaccine-preventable disease rather than weak arguments that this current measles outbreak is normal. The time for this messaging was before the Children’s Health Defense tried to push ‘natural immunity to measles’ as superior to vaccine-induced immunity,” Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what still worries medical experts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy, increasing measles spread and questionable decisions from the current administration concern medical professionals. Below, they share their thoughts on the current measles outbreak in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles is known as a “herald infection” because it’s the first disease that shows up when vaccination rates are low.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is what experts call a “herald infection,” because “typically, when we see an outbreak of measles, that heralds the fact that vaccine rates have dropped enough that we’re starting to see these,” Meade said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then we may start to see other things, like polio, like mumps, other things that we haven’t seen in this country for quite some time,” added Meade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuzzo noted that a school in &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/san-antonio-texas-school-confirms-case-of-rubella-german-measles-as-measles-rubeola-outbreak-in-state-reaches-146-vaccinations-child-death-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-contagious-infection" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Texas reported a rubella case" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c1e1e8e4b0bf5486407bf8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/san-antonio-texas-school-confirms-case-of-rubella-german-measles-as-measles-rubeola-outbreak-in-state-reaches-146-vaccinations-child-death-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-contagious-infection" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;Texas reported a rubella case&lt;/a&gt;, which is pertinent because the measles vaccine, which is known as the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine also prevents rubella infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason that measles shows up first is because it’s highly contagious, said Meade. It’s more contagious than both COVID and the flu. “It’s one of the most contagious illnesses that we see,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just to put things in perspective for people, if someone has measles and they cough or sneeze in a room, and then they leave the room, and you walk into the room two hours later, you can become infected with measles,” explained Meade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pediatricians across the country have a very deep understanding of infectious diseases and how something like measles can actually really herald a bigger problem,” said Meade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of measles patients in Texas are hospitalized, which is worrisome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a lot of people in the hospital, and I have to say that is also deeply concerning, one because measles is very tough for hospitals because of the isolation that’s required [since] it’s such a contagious disease, [and] there’s so many vulnerable people in hospitals,” said Nuzzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="According to data" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c1e1e8e4b0bf5486407bf8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;According to data&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas Health and Human Services department, 20 of 146 people are currently hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. suggested in last week’s cabinet meeting that people are in the hospital for quarantine and isolation, which isn’t true, Nuzzo noted. They’re in the hospital because they’re sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, just to say that, yes, we have had a death, but we also have a lot of people in the hospital, and that means that they are ill enough to be in the hospital,” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jan Sonnenmair via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jan Sonnenmair via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;"We are seeing comments that this is 'normal,' or it's expected, and a death of a child from measles in the United States should never be expected because we have a way to prevent this," said Dr. Elizabeth Meade.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They worry this outbreak could impact the country’s ability to maintain our measles elimination status.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We declared measles eliminated, which is you drive down the incidence to near zero, but not necessarily zero, like 25 years ago,” said Nuzzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the U.S. has been able to maintain its measles elimination status, but there was a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="large measles outbreak in New York" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c1e1e8e4b0bf5486407bf8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;large measles outbreak in New York&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 where the U.S. just “barely missed losing our measles elimination status, so we’ve retained it.” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But when we have outbreaks that spiral out of control that could imperil our measles elimination status ... I think [it] has consequences,” Nuzzo noted. “It has huge psychological consequences in terms of what kind of country we are and how committed to public health we are. That would put us on par with some of the more resource-constrained settings in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, I think it is something that we have to take quite seriously in terms of our stature,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re worried about your health or your loved ones health, there are precautions you can take.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With measles cases cropping up throughout the country, it’s natural to be worried. But “if you’re a fully vaccinated individual [and] you are not immunocompromised, you should have no reason to be scared,” said Patel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t sure if you’ve had your measles vaccine, you can talk to your doctor about getting your titers drawn, which is a blood test that shows the level of antibodies in your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t been vaccinated or haven’t had both doses of the shot, Meade said your best bet is to get the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first MMR dose is generally given to babies at 12 months, but if you are worried about your child’s exposure, talk to your doctor about getting them the vaccine early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do this for kids who have to travel out of the country to places that have endemic measles, and we’re certainly doing it for children who are living near the epicenters of the current outbreaks that we’re seeing,” Meade said.

One company sees that as a win-win for seniors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;America’s aging population means that the demand for in-home care services has never been higher. One company sees that as a win-win for seniors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seniorshelpingseniors.com/"&gt;Seniors Helping Seniors&lt;/a&gt; employs mostly retirees to provide in-home nonmedical care, support and companionship, with a team of senior care professionals who train and assist them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do have nurses who supervise and oversee care. Most of our caregivers are retired professionals who are looking to stay active and earn a little extra money,” said Ben Chernow, owner of Seniors Helping Seniors in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other franchises in Laurel, Maryland, and Springfield and Centreville, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caregiver positions start at $20 per hour and increase to $21 per hour after completing a dementia certification course. The company said it also offers retirement benefits and flexible work schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For clients, costs vary by location and services involved, but care generally costs around $40 per hour. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors who are right for the job (the company says it only hires caregivers who have the compassion and interpersonal skills to build relationships) provide an advantage for those they are caring for. They are seen as peers, not just hired help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the main places we see that is people who have dementia, Often, built into that dementia is resistance to care and unwillingness to open their home to a caregiver. That resistance is something we are able to work around, because of the comfort level with somebody who is closer in age to them,” said Chernow, a former lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, who left the legal profession to do something he said he found more fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors Helping Seniors caregivers come from diverse backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our caregivers include former diplomats, attorneys, business executives,” Chernow said. “We actually just hired a former Olympic gymnast. It is a really diverse group of people who often don’t have a background in this. We provide them the training and knowledge they need in order to be good caregivers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors Helping Seniors also makes it a priority to match clients with caregivers who have compatible personalities and similar interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors Helping Seniors was founded in 1998 and began franchising in 2006. It now has 180 franchise operators and 350 locations in 38 states.&lt;/p&gt;

            The measles outbreak is surging in West Texas, especially in under-vaccinated communities, but it’s not just coverage with the measles vaccine that is lagging behind. The use of other key vaccines in the childhood immunization schedule has decreased too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001f3b5v5k28k6tg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With lower vaccination rates, experts worry about what vaccine preventable illnesses we could see next.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pewy6w004e3b5vyykh1kzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coverage with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), polio, and varicella, or chickenpox vaccines, all &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?ldkjfdl" target="_blank"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt; in more than 30 states last year compared with the year before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001g3b5vkc5t3f3w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are extremely concerned that all of these vaccine preventable illnesses may potentially be making a comeback … But that is, sadly, what may be a reality for us If we continue on a path of questioning legitimate science,” said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7szy8n900003b6mg7tkdd4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here are some of the illnesses that could emerge again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The percentage of kindergartners who received the DTaP vaccine has steadily declined over the past &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;five years&lt;/a&gt;, leaving thousands of children vulnerable. Protection among those who are vaccinated can also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/whooping-cough-cases-surging-human-challenge/index.html"&gt;fade over time&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001k3b5veoggyvs9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rates of pertussis, better known as whooping cough, declined after widespread vaccine use began in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html#:~:text=Widespread%20use%20of%20the%20vaccine,with%20the%20pre%2Dvaccine%20era." target="_blank"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;. They started to rise again in the 1980s, largely due to increased surveillance and some waning vaccine immunity, but later decreased during the pandemic, when spread of many infectious diseases slowed due to masking and distancing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pei6t400443b5vrc28q2ot@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say declining vaccination has now lead to an uptick in cases. Last year, there were more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;35,000&lt;/a&gt; cases of whooping cough in the US, the largest number seen in more than a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7peat3p003l3b5v1nj80xrl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Early on during the pandemic, access to healthcare was limited and persons were recommended to stay home. This led to a lack of access to vaccines and a clear, early decrease in rates of vaccination,” Dr. Richard Martinello chief medical officer and professor of infectious diseases at Yale Medicine wrote in an email to CNN. “However, during this time, we also saw an acceleration in the spread of misinformation and disinformation about vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001l3b5vxvl1bk6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whooping cough, a contagious respiratory illness can develop into a painful, full-body cough. The coughing fits can be severe, often accompanied by a whooping sound when people try to catch their breath. Severe cases can be fatal. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt; 10 people died, including six less than 1 year old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pehpwf00413b5vkh968sfg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It most severely affects infants but the DTaP vaccine can prevent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/cases-of-whooping-cough-on-the-rise.html" target="_blank"&gt;nine out of 10&lt;/a&gt; infants from hospitalization. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20routine%20DTaP%20vaccination,4%20through%206%20years" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends five DTaP doses before the age of 7, with follow up boosters of Tdap in adolescence and adulthood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001p3b5v56c6lpw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Polio&lt;/a&gt; is a contagious virus that at first may give flu-like symptoms but could in some more serious cases progress to meningitis or even paralysis. The CDC recommends four doses of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/hcp/effectiveness-duration-protection.html" target="_blank"&gt;99% effective&lt;/a&gt;, before the age of 6.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7t02g0a00073b6mrv231wg1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you drop immunization rates low enough in various areas, polio could come back,” said Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Philadelphia Children’s Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001q3b5v39xpkv8i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Polio cases were once common in the United States and around the world. During one of the&lt;a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/Diseases%20and%20Conditions/Polio%20.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; most severe outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in 1952, the virus infected 58,000 people in the US, paralyzed more than 21,000 and killed more than 3,100. However, vaccination campaigns cut cases dramatically. The last naturally occurring case of polio in the US was in 1979.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001r3b5vapt3081a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2022, a man in Rockland County, New York, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/health/new-york-polio/index.html"&gt;developed a paralysis&lt;/a&gt; from polio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001s3b5vtjjaj75g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He represented the tip of much bigger iceberg. Only one in 200 people who are infected with polio will be paralyzed by it,” said Offit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001t3b5vs98oc9h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More of the community likely had the virus, experts say. Vaccination rates in Rockland County were only around &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/polio/county_vaccination_rates.htm" target="_blank"&gt;60%.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001u3b5v52ysbtj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In that particular man’s ZIP code or area, immunization rates had dropped … that’s why it arose there. So let that happen elsewhere and you could see that happen again,” said Offit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7pec0mc003u3b5vh7ruobma@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="fewer-vaccinations-and-more-illnesses" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Fewer vaccinations and more illnesses
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001w3b5vxrmyphe8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If vaccination rates continue to decline, the US can expect to see more cases of pneumococcal disease, Haemophilus influenzae type b, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, hepatitis, and rotavirus, according to Martinello.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7takksp00003b5v4mceql38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without use of the HPV vaccine, experts warn there could be an increase in HPV associated cancers, like cervical, throat and neck cancer, within the next few decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001x3b5vhz502p4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These are all included in the routine childhood vaccine schedule – the one that US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he plans to investigate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7tcsfh700063b6mirb2ys83@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The childhood immunization schedule is decided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with input from its outside vaccine advisers. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians and American College of Obestetricians and Gynecologists also approve the schedule. This informs the best time for children to get vaccinated depending on when they will best be able to build immunity against specific illnesses and when they could become most susceptible to diseases. The vaccines on the schedule undergo&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;studies to make sure they are safe to use with other vaccines in the schedule and safety data is continuously evaluated, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001y3b5vrqaczefz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All of these aren’t necessarily benign illnesses,” said Johns. “Everybody seems to think that these are all just mild illnesses that you have to get through. And I think that sadly, because vaccines have been such a victim of their own success, we haven’t seen a lot of these infections … so it’s it can be easy to be tricked into thinking that it’s not a big deal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe2rkl00123b5v63hult58@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some vaccine preventable illnesses still circulate abroad, a problem which could be exacerbated by the Trump administration’s extensive funding cuts from &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/politics/usaid-government-spending-global-aid-dg/index.html"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt;, which supported immunization programs around the world.

            The measles outbreak is surging in West Texas, especially in under-vaccinated communities, but it’s not just coverage with the measles vaccine that is lagging behind. The use of other key vaccines in the childhood immunization schedule has decreased too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001f3b5v5k28k6tg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With lower vaccination rates, experts worry about what vaccine preventable illnesses we could see next.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pewy6w004e3b5vyykh1kzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coverage with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), polio, and varicella, or chickenpox vaccines, all &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?ldkjfdl" target="_blank"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt; in more than 30 states last year compared with the year before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001g3b5vkc5t3f3w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are extremely concerned that all of these vaccine preventable illnesses may potentially be making a comeback … But that is, sadly, what may be a reality for us If we continue on a path of questioning legitimate science,” said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7szy8n900003b6mg7tkdd4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here are some of the illnesses that could emerge again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001i3b5v3xnjbmgi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The percentage of kindergartners who received the DTaP vaccine has steadily declined over the past &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;five years&lt;/a&gt;, leaving thousands of children vulnerable. Protection among those who are vaccinated can also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/whooping-cough-cases-surging-human-challenge/index.html"&gt;fade over time&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001k3b5veoggyvs9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rates of pertussis, better known as whooping cough, declined after widespread vaccine use began in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html#:~:text=Widespread%20use%20of%20the%20vaccine,with%20the%20pre%2Dvaccine%20era." target="_blank"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;. They started to rise again in the 1980s, largely due to increased surveillance and some waning vaccine immunity, but later decreased during the pandemic, when spread of many infectious diseases slowed due to masking and distancing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pei6t400443b5vrc28q2ot@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say declining vaccination has now lead to an uptick in cases. Last year, there were more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;35,000&lt;/a&gt; cases of whooping cough in the US, the largest number seen in more than a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7peat3p003l3b5v1nj80xrl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Early on during the pandemic, access to healthcare was limited and persons were recommended to stay home. This led to a lack of access to vaccines and a clear, early decrease in rates of vaccination,” Dr. Richard Martinello chief medical officer and professor of infectious diseases at Yale Medicine wrote in an email to CNN. “However, during this time, we also saw an acceleration in the spread of misinformation and disinformation about vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001l3b5vxvl1bk6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whooping cough, a contagious respiratory illness can develop into a painful, full-body cough. The coughing fits can be severe, often accompanied by a whooping sound when people try to catch their breath. Severe cases can be fatal. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt; 10 people died, including six less than 1 year old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pehpwf00413b5vkh968sfg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It most severely affects infants but the DTaP vaccine can prevent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/cases-of-whooping-cough-on-the-rise.html" target="_blank"&gt;nine out of 10&lt;/a&gt; infants from hospitalization. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20routine%20DTaP%20vaccination,4%20through%206%20years" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends five DTaP doses before the age of 7, with follow up boosters of Tdap in adolescence and adulthood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001p3b5v56c6lpw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Polio&lt;/a&gt; is a contagious virus that at first may give flu-like symptoms but could in some more serious cases progress to meningitis or even paralysis. The CDC recommends four doses of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/hcp/effectiveness-duration-protection.html" target="_blank"&gt;99% effective&lt;/a&gt;, before the age of 6.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “If you drop immunization rates low enough in various areas, polio could come back,” said Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Philadelphia Children’s Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001q3b5v39xpkv8i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Polio cases were once common in the United States and around the world. During one of the&lt;a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/Diseases%20and%20Conditions/Polio%20.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; most severe outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in 1952, the virus infected 58,000 people in the US, paralyzed more than 21,000 and killed more than 3,100. However, vaccination campaigns cut cases dramatically. The last naturally occurring case of polio in the US was in 1979.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001r3b5vapt3081a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2022, a man in Rockland County, New York, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/health/new-york-polio/index.html"&gt;developed a paralysis&lt;/a&gt; from polio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001s3b5vtjjaj75g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He represented the tip of much bigger iceberg. Only one in 200 people who are infected with polio will be paralyzed by it,” said Offit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001t3b5vs98oc9h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More of the community likely had the virus, experts say. Vaccination rates in Rockland County were only around &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/polio/county_vaccination_rates.htm" target="_blank"&gt;60%.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001u3b5v52ysbtj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In that particular man’s ZIP code or area, immunization rates had dropped … that’s why it arose there. So let that happen elsewhere and you could see that happen again,” said Offit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7pec0mc003u3b5vh7ruobma@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="fewer-vaccinations-and-more-illnesses" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Fewer vaccinations and more illnesses
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001w3b5vxrmyphe8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If vaccination rates continue to decline, the US can expect to see more cases of pneumococcal disease, Haemophilus influenzae type b, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, hepatitis, and rotavirus, according to Martinello.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7takksp00003b5v4mceql38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without use of the HPV vaccine, experts warn there could be an increase in HPV associated cancers, like cervical, throat and neck cancer, within the next few decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001x3b5vhz502p4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These are all included in the routine childhood vaccine schedule – the one that US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he plans to investigate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7tcsfh700063b6mirb2ys83@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The childhood immunization schedule is decided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with input from its outside vaccine advisers. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians and American College of Obestetricians and Gynecologists also approve the schedule. This informs the best time for children to get vaccinated depending on when they will best be able to build immunity against specific illnesses and when they could become most susceptible to diseases. The vaccines on the schedule undergo&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;studies to make sure they are safe to use with other vaccines in the schedule and safety data is continuously evaluated, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001y3b5vrqaczefz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All of these aren’t necessarily benign illnesses,” said Johns. “Everybody seems to think that these are all just mild illnesses that you have to get through. And I think that sadly, because vaccines have been such a victim of their own success, we haven’t seen a lot of these infections … so it’s it can be easy to be tricked into thinking that it’s not a big deal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) notified Dare County health officials on March 3 of a laboratory confirmed positive test result for Highly Pathogenic Avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 or bird flu in a backyard flock in Dare County. &lt;span id="more-331930"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-1be1ad034c6eb7be1ec7a1d0754990b8 outer-mobile-content-top" id="outer-1be1ad034c6eb7be1ec7a1d0754990b8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-3885d5750879c832e8cbd565056dce84 outer-content-top" id="outer-3885d5750879c832e8cbd565056dce84"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first confirmed positive in a backyard flock in Dare County. In January, HPAI was found in a commercial operation in Hyde County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In coordination with the flock owner, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture has completed a depopulation of the flock and Dare County Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services (DCDHHS) officials are working with state partners to respond to any potential human exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avian influenza is a disease caused by avian influenza A virus, which can affect most species of birds and some animals. While Avian flu can make people sick, it is rare and the risk to the public remains low. To date, there has been no human-to-human spread identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-09a29d6f0bdec881c76ac90642b92b1f outer-mobile-content-mid" id="outer-09a29d6f0bdec881c76ac90642b92b1f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;March 3, 2020: It's the day we learned of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in our state, and the day life changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Strange words suddenly became part of our daily lexicon: Social distancing. Flatten the curve.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;We donned masks for daily tasks. Many stopped hugging family members who didn't live in the same household.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Soon, schools and church sanctuaries emptied out—as did our sidewalks, restaurants and streets. A certain solitude set in. And sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It was March 3, 2020, when Governor Roy Cooper said a man in Wake County tested positive for coronavirus. It was North Carolina’s first case of the new illness.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The patient had recently traveled to Washington state and was exposed to a long-term care facility that had reported numerous cases of coronavirus. The Wake County patient traveled through Raleigh-Durham International Airport on Feb. 22, 2020, airport officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;At that time, nine people had died from the illness in Washington state, all in the Seattle area. Washington state officials had reported 27 confirmed cases of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Among the first North Carolinians the virus claimed was a Raleigh city employee, a man in his mid-30s named Adrian Grubbs.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"All this happened so fast," his wife told us then.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She said he was a loving husband and devoted father.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Since then, more than 34,000 people in our state have died from the virus. From Jan. 1, 2020, to Sept. 9, 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/index.htm"&gt;the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics reported&lt;/a&gt; that 34,265 people in North Carolina died from Covid.&lt;/p&gt;

Individuals experiencing depression, both currently and in the past, showed alterations in various small molecules in their blood, particularly those related to fats. These findings suggest that disruptions in the body’s metabolism, especially concerning fats, may play a significant role in the development and experience of depression, opening new avenues for understanding and potentially treating this widespread condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is known to be a multifaceted condition influenced by genetics, environment, and lifestyle. While psychological and social factors are clearly important, researchers are increasingly recognizing that biological processes within the body are also deeply involved. Previous studies exploring the body’s chemistry in relation to depression have often been limited in scope, either focusing on a small number of substances or not involving participants formally diagnosed with depression through thorough psychiatric assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome these limitations and gain a more comprehensive view, researchers aimed to conduct a detailed investigation of a wide range of substances in the blood of a large group of people, including those with current and past depression, as well as healthy individuals, and to repeat these measurements over time. This approach was designed to identify a robust and reliable biological signature associated with major depressive disorder and to explore potential causal links between these biological changes and depression itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the research team utilized data from a large, ongoing Dutch study called the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. This study has been tracking the mental and physical health of thousands of participants over many years. For this particular analysis, the researchers examined blood samples collected from 2,770 participants at the start of the study. This group included 1,101 people who were experiencing major depressive disorder at the time of the study, 868 people who had experienced depression in the past but were currently in remission, and 801 healthy individuals with no history of depression. Six years later, blood samples were collected again from 1,805 of these participants, allowing for a follow-up analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the study underwent detailed assessments, including psychiatric interviews to determine if they met the criteria for major depressive disorder according to established diagnostic guidelines. The severity of their depressive symptoms was also measured using a self-report questionnaire that asked about their mood and other symptoms in the week prior to the assessment. In addition to collecting blood samples, the researchers gathered information on various factors that could influence both depression and the substances in the blood. These factors included age, sex, education level, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption habits, existing chronic diseases, and medication use, including lipid-lowering drugs and different types of antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood samples were analyzed using a sophisticated technology that can measure hundreds of different small molecules, known as metabolites, in a single sample. This platform, called Metabolon, allowed the researchers to get a broad overview of the body’s metabolic state. The researchers implemented rigorous quality control procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of their metabolite measurements. They then used statistical models to examine the relationships between the levels of these metabolites and depression status (current depression, past depression, or healthy control) and depression symptom severity, while taking into account the various influencing factors they had measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further explore the nature of these relationships, the researchers also employed a technique called Mendelian randomization. This method uses genetic variations as tools to investigate potential cause-and-effect relationships between metabolite levels and depression risk. By leveraging large genetic datasets, they could examine if genetically predicted changes in metabolite levels were associated with a higher or lower risk of developing depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the initial blood samples revealed that a substantial number of metabolites were different in people with current major depressive disorder compared to healthy controls. Specifically, 139 metabolites showed significant differences. Among these, 92 were found to be at lower levels, while 47 were at higher levels in individuals with current depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large proportion of these altered metabolites, 79 in total, were also associated with the severity of depression symptoms, meaning that the more severe the symptoms, the more pronounced the changes in these metabolites. Interestingly, many of the same metabolites that were altered in people with current depression were also changed in those with past depression, although the changes were generally less pronounced in the remitted group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed that a significant portion of the altered metabolites were lipids, or fat-like substances. When the researchers grouped the metabolites into biological pathways, they found that certain pathways related to fats were particularly affected. Metabolites that were found to be decreased in depression were enriched in long-chain monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids, which are types of fats that are important for energy storage and cell structure. Conversely, metabolites that were increased in depression were enriched in lysophospholipids, a class of fats that play roles in cell signaling and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the robustness of their findings, the researchers repeated some of their analyses using the blood samples collected six years later. They were able to confirm 34 of the initially identified metabolites, finding consistent directions of change between the baseline and follow-up measurements. This replication strengthened the evidence that these metabolic alterations are indeed linked to depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, using Mendelian randomization, the researchers explored whether any of the identified metabolites might have a causal role in depression. Their analysis suggested that genetically predicted higher levels of a specific lysophospholipid, called 1-linoleoyl-GPE, were associated with an increased risk of depression. This finding provides preliminary evidence that this particular fat-like substance, or the biological processes that control its levels, could potentially contribute to the development of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged some limitations to their study. While the follow-up measurements provided some confirmation, it was not a completely independent replication because it involved the same group of people at a later time point. Future studies in entirely new groups of participants are needed to further validate these findings. Additionally, the study design was observational, mainly showing associations rather than definitive proof of cause and effect, except for the preliminary causal evidence from the Mendelian randomization. The participants were also primarily of European ancestry, so it remains to be seen if these findings generalize to other populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02613-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The metabolome-wide signature of major depressive disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Rick Jansen, Yuri Milaneschi, Daniela Schranner, Gabi Kastenmuller, Matthias Arnold, Xianlin Han, Boadie W.

&lt;p&gt;INDIANA, USA — The Indiana Department of Natural Resources Division (DNR) said they have &lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/life/animals/sandhill-crane-bird-flu-deaths-indiana/417-09ba1bc6-2bdb-4535-bddf-3f5a575c68a3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;detected bird flu&lt;/a&gt; in a total of 30 counties. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flu has hit Indiana's commercial poultry and egg farms especially hard. The state Board of Animal health &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/boah/species-information/avianbirds/highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza/2022-2023-case-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;estimates almost 7 million birds &lt;/a&gt;have been impacted by the virus at almost 40 facilities statewide. But wild birds are also at risk. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indiana DNR said they are continuing to detect highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in wild birds throughout Indiana. The Indiana DNR also said HPAI is suspected in an additional 32 counties based on reports involving the deaths of raptors, cranes and waterfowl. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"HPAI is a disease caused by an influenza virus that usually spreads among birds. It is common in wild birds, especially waterfowl, shorebirds, and raptors," the Indiana DNR Division of Fish and Wildlife said in a news release. "Notably, &lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/life/animals/sandhill-crane-bird-flu-deaths-indiana/417-09ba1bc6-2bdb-4535-bddf-3f5a575c68a3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;more than 1,500 sandhill cranes have been affected by the virus&lt;/a&gt; since January, resulting in a large number of sandhill crane deaths in Greene, Jackson, Jasper, LaPorte, Newton, Starke, and Union counties."&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;If you find sick or dead wild birds, please report them &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/dnr/fish-and-wildlife/wildlife-resources/wildlife-diseases-in-indiana/sick-or-dead-wildlife-reporting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;online here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's affecting waterfowl across the whole world," Eli Fleace, wildlife biologist for Indiana DNR, said. "It's been found in multiple different countries across a lot of different continents. It's so spread out, that it's even affected penguins down in Antarctica."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

However, he also notes, there can be wide variability regarding health and appearance among people of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“You can see 70-year-olds who look like they are 50 and 70-year-olds who look like they’re 90,” says Lachs. “It’s very individualized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Genetics, lifestyle choices and the conditions in which a person lives can affect how they age. It’s also possible for your chronological age – how many years you’ve been alive – to differ from your biological age – how old your body appears – based on biomarkers and how well your body is functioning. Even your organs can &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06802-1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;age at different rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-the-body-change-in-your-70s" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How does the body change in your 70s?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While there is no “normal” way to age, certain health challenges can be more common during your 70s. By age 75, people typically receive, on average, between two to three medical diagnoses, explains Lachs; these might include arthritis, hypertension and hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lachs says that people in their 70s can remain independent and generally healthy, depending on factors such as economic background, genetics, psychosocial environment and motivation to commit to good habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4db95704-402d-4451-8e9a-86dd892e3bf7" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Illustration: Ananya Broker Parekh/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The likelihood of hearing loss increases with age, says Lachs, though to what extent depends on the individual. About &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/age-related-hearing-loss" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one in three&lt;/a&gt; people between 65 and 74 and nearly half of people older than 75 have hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It’s also possible that your reaction time may slow down, says Lachs, but not to a concerning extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Seventy is a great time for somebody to try something new&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeffrey Stokes, University of Massachusetts Boston&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;People in their 70s might also experience sleep issues. Research &lt;a href="https://www.sleepmedres.org/journal/view.php?number=193" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; sleep quality decreases as age increases; &lt;a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2013/04/sleep-it#:~:text=" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found adults older than 60 had a 70% loss of deep sleep compared with people between 18 and 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, compared with other decades, the 70s can be a pretty stable time for health, says Dr Deborah Kado, a professor of medicine and co-director of the Stanford Longevity Center. This is especially true for women, the majority of whom already experienced swings of change when they went through &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/17/perimenopause-symptoms" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;. There will always be unforeseeable health hurdles, but these can happen at any age; what’s key, she says, is committing to healthy behaviors before you turn 70 and sticking with them after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="which-health-tests-should-you-get-regularly-in-your-70s" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Which health tests should you get regularly in your 70s?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Many health screenings recommended by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US and the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK for older adults are framed as guidance for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/24/healthy-aging-process-60s" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;adults aged 65 and older&lt;/a&gt;. The free NHS &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nhs-health-check/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;health check&lt;/a&gt; concludes at age 74. In part, this lack of guidance explicitly aimed at older ages is due to limited research on the effectiveness of these tests, says Kado. A Harvard Medical School &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/screening-after-age-75" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on screening after age 75 also observes that it can be difficult to provide general recommendations because individual needs at this stage can vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Screenings become more complicated as we age, and knowing when to stop screening can be challenging, Lachs explains. If you have a family history of a disease, it can be helpful to speak with your doctor about what’s right for you and discuss the costs and benefits. For some, a screening could lead to preventative care that increases quality of life. For others, incidental findings may primarily cause anxiety and lead to invasive, minimally helpful procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One screening Lachs does recommend for people in their 70s is a bone mineral density test, which measures bone strength and thickness. This test is a tool for &lt;a href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoporosis/diagnosis-treatment-and-steps-to-take" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;early intervention&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/22/osteoporosis-menopause-bone-density-diagnosis-treatment" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, which becomes more common as people age. While men typically lose bone density more slowly than women, both groups lose bone mass at about the same rate by age 65 to 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="20e5e4fe-14fa-40a3-89e8-180e8f91a0fa" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":21,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Taking care of the grandchildren?

If, for example, a screening like this suggests a person is at risk for falling, Lachs can recommend that they work with a physical therapist to decrease that risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a volunteer group of national experts, does &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007466.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; men and women be screened for colorectal cancer regularly from age 65 to 75 and for lung cancer between 50 and 80. The USPSTF also &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007463.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;observes&lt;/a&gt; that mammograms “work best” at finding cancer in women aged 40 to 74, and it’s not clear how helpful these tests are for women 75 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The NHS offers bowel cancer &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bowel-cancer-screening/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;screenings&lt;/a&gt; for everyone aged 54 to 74. It​​ also provides lung cancer &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/lung-cancer-screening/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;screenings&lt;/a&gt; to people who have smoked between the ages of 55 and 74. The NHS also &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/breast-screening-helping-women-decide/nhs-breast-screening-helping-you-decide#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;invites&lt;/a&gt; women aged 50 to 71 to have a breast cancer screening – though women over 71 can still make appointments to screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="which-vaccines-should-you-get-in-your-70s" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Which vaccines should you get in your 70s?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lachs strongly recommends people stay up to date with their vaccines. He speaks with his patients about the increased importance of vaccinating as an older person; unvaccinated older adults are at a greater risk of experiencing severe illness; as we get older, it’s harder for the &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/why-vaccinations-are-vital-for-older-adults/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; to fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Several vaccines are recommended for older adults, though it’s important to speak with your care provider about what is right for you. In the US, the NIH &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/immunizations-and-vaccines/vaccinations-and-older-adults" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; getting vaccinated for Covid-19, flu, pneumonia and shingles, and getting the Tdap; the latter is the vaccine for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, and all adults are advised to get one dose and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/adult-age.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;then a booster&lt;/a&gt; every 10 years.

Instead, any type of cardiovascular exercise at modest levels will do, including actions like dancing, walking and climbing the stairs. He’s especially a fan of yoga because it helps with balance and flexibility while providing a social outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/article/2024/jun/14/what-is-social-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Positive, enriching relationships&lt;/a&gt; also strengthen physical and cognitive health, which promotes longevity, says Stokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;There’s no drug better than a good night’s sleep&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr Mark Lachs, Weill Cornell Medicine&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;As people hit 70, they tend to put less effort into casual relationships and invest more into their already closest and most rewarding connections, he explains. Often retired, they focus more on their marriages, kids and grandkids. Being a grandparent who helps out can be especially rewarding because research suggests &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;strong relationships&lt;/a&gt; that provide a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18429482/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;sense of purpose&lt;/a&gt; are even likelier to imbue health benefits, Stokes explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d72fd489-c707-4250-8f66-299ac1aa5051" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Illustration: Ananya Broker Parekh/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But while people in their 70s are good at focusing on their most rewarding relationships and repairing the benefits, they’re less skilled at creating and fostering new relationships, Stokes says. Targeting this area “can go a long way in reducing some of the loneliness and isolation” that can affect people’s oldest years, he explains. Close ties are great, but it can be even better to have a rich and diverse social network that can support you – especially because bereavement can become more common as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lifespan can also be improved through diet – less meat and more plants, advises Lachs. A 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00793-y" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found a combination of consuming foods or supplements rich in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/feb/03/an-omega-3-dose-a-day-could-slow-ageing-process-healthspan-trial-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;omega-3 oils&lt;/a&gt; and vitamin D, combined with exercise, is a recipe for slowing biological ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Sleep is important, too. The National Institute on Ageing (NIA) and the &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/mental-health-issues/sleep/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/sleep/good-nights-sleep#:~:text=rest" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that older adults get seven to nine hours each night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There’s no drug I could prescribe that is better than a good night’s sleep,” Lachs says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-it-too-late-to-get-fit-after-70" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Is it too late to get fit after 70?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Studies suggest that by adopting healthy lifestyle choices, you can “reverse a lot of damage and physiologically even appear younger than you did before you implemented those changes”, says Kado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This is true for your 70s and beyond,” she says. “You can be in a nursing home in your 90s, start high-intensity interval training, and see over 170% increase in your thigh muscle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the NIA, &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/how-can-strength-training-build-healthier-bodies-we-age" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that exercises that support endurance, balance, strength and flexibility help older adults maintain muscle mass and stay healthy and independent for longer. The NIA also emphasizes that almost anyone at any age can exercise and offers &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/exercise-and-physical-activity/exercising-chronic-conditions" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for people with chronic conditions. A 2009 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/485271" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that adults who started exercising between the ages of 70 and 78 were more likely to live longer and be less lonely than adults of the same age who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But the reverse is also true. If people don’t engage in behaviors like exercising, their health will likely decline, Kado says. Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9772844/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that about 30% of adults over 70 have trouble with walking, climbing stairs and getting out of a chair. These results can be mitigated by exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If you don’t use your muscles, you’re going to lose more muscle and be more likely to lose your mobility,” she says. “This can impact your mood, independence and cognitive ability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-stop-worrying-about-getting-older" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How do you stop worrying about getting older?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Thoughts about ageing are often plagued by ageism, says Stokes. This viewpoint causes us to hyperfocus on the negative aspects of ageing, and incorrectly predict what getting older will be like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There’s an overemphasis on decline,” he says. “People in their 70s often say that they don’t feel old, and the reason for it is that they don’t meet the definition of old we often use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Further, &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-832261.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests people with more positive views of ageing are the ones who live longer. Kado describes a more positive view of ageing as a “type of resilience” that helps a person deal with life’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="16eac6c7-6d5f-4f59-bb00-5d54133bc379" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":51,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"After being dumped at 58, I realized I was not equipped for the grief","elementId":"16eac6c7-6d5f-4f59-bb00-5d54133bc379","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/jan/27/gray-divorce-grief"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Generally, my older patients who are doing super well beyond their 70s have that resilience factor,” says Kado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;We can also combat fears of getting older by embracing the positive aspects of ageing, says Stokes. For example, when it comes to mental and emotional health, people in their 70s tend to be happier and more satisfied than people in their 40s and 50s, he explains. The stress of child-rearing and work is likely gone, and they have a greater capacity to enjoy the good and ignore the bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The ultimate irony about ageism is you become the object of your discrimination,” says Lachs. “Find older role models, people in their 80s and 90s, and learn from them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:15:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBnb25LUVlhcklJR0F2M1h2ckdmUmlXV0F2X1dWYzMxQ0ZsVU5zMDZfa0dRVUxDM2NuZXNVRW55MVVGVGFGbS12OTh6VHdqV3FVT2tjWGJxUm5Bc3ZxVWw0VFFQRE16VDhiY3NJOGdvYjFBV2UyaDltek9tSHZTems</guid></item><item><title>Got Disgusting Pink Slime In Your Bathroom?

It wasn’t the work of prophets turning water to wine, however, but an outbreak of bacteria Venetian pharmacist Bartolomeo Bizio named &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why am I telling you this? Because if you’ve got pink goo in your bathroom, you have been visited by the same bloody pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Serratia &lt;/em&gt;is a genus of gram-negative bacteria that sits within the Enterobacteriaceae family. The species &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt; is fond of moist environments, which is why it’s a common culprit in bathrooms, kitchens, along the seams of shower curtains, and around &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/a-household-invader-may-be-setting-up-camp-in-your-sink-66584" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;plugholes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an almost ironic twist of events, it can be especially fond of the little cubby holes where you store soap because it feeds on fatty deposits, which are the building blocks of soaps and shampoos. There have also been hospital outbreaks associated with contaminated &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3592283/" target="_blank"&gt;soap dispensers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt; dangerous?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As TikTok physician &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.karanr/video/7434227340990827809?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;Dr Karan Raj&lt;/a&gt; explained in a recent video, for people with fully functioning immune systems, encountering &lt;em&gt;S. marcescens&lt;/em&gt; is typically harmless. However, it does have the potential to cause nasty infections, particularly respiratory and urinary infections. It’s not considered a common cause of primary disease, but can result in significant symptoms when it’s able to infect someone who is already compromised due to illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.karanr/video/7434227340990827809" data-video-id="7434227340990827809" id="v69407367456975150"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="social-disclaimer-icon"&gt;ⓘ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="social-disclaimer"&gt;IFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of its capacity to spread comes down to the fact that it can form a &lt;a href="https://microbenotes.com/serratia-marcescens-an-overview/" target="_blank"&gt;biofilm&lt;/a&gt; (something we’ve harnessed to make “&lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/exploiting-bacteria-produce-living-materials-24069" target="_blank"&gt;living materials&lt;/a&gt;”), making it easier to stick to surfaces and spread. This can include medical devices and catheters, and once they’ve infected a host the biofilm can form a barrier against their immune response. Infections can be difficult to treat, so it’s a bacteria you really want to avoid. Fortunately, its bright coloration makes it easy to spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get rid of &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve spotted the dreaded pink slime colonizing your bathroom, it’s time to get the marigolds out and mix a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. You can drench the bacteria in the vinegar-water mix and leave to stand for &lt;a href="https://smol.com/uk/stories/help-what-are-these-pink-mould-stains-in-my-shower?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;10 minutes&lt;/a&gt;, then scrub and rinse away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should be sufficient to get rid of the pink slime that has already attached itself to your bathroom, but the next step is prevention. &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt; likes moist environments, so crack open a window after you’ve showered or get the extractor fan on to keep humidity to a minimum. You can also make the soapy bits of your bathroom less inviting for &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt; by ensuring any soap residue gets swiftly wiped away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of humidity can invite a veritable rainbow of pathogens into your home, so good ventilation can help you to keep a host of unwanted nasties out.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the nation combats high egg prices due to viral chicken deaths, Louisiana officials say the state’s poultry farmers remain unaffected, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/state/2025/03/03/louisiana-commercial-poultry-farms-untouched-by-bird-flu-officials-say/80843092007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the USA Today network reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The virus is in the state, killing wild bird populations, but has largely avoided commercial poultry farmers thus far. The key, experts say, may be Louisiana cattle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture is spending $1 billion in a five-pronged approach to combat this year’s predicted 40% increase in egg prices. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/usda-invests-1-billion-combat-avian-flu-and-reduce-egg-prices" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;announcement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; came Feb. 26, though it’s currently unclear how much of that money will reach Louisiana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain says Louisiana’s 300 commercial poultry farmers so far have avoided the virus’s deadly path. In the past 30 days alone, 139 flocks have been infected, killing 18.72 million birds &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;nationwide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once a single chicken is infected, the entire flock must be culled, and other chicken coops miles away are at risk of the same fate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The bottom line is that if you get a house that’s infected, they will die within 36 to 48 hours—every bird there,” Strain says. “And then what happens is the amount of virus that is there generally spreads aerosolized to the next barn … if you do not shut off the fans and not stop the virus from multiplying in the barn, that virus can spread up to 8 miles away.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/state/2025/03/03/louisiana-commercial-poultry-farms-untouched-by-bird-flu-officials-say/80843092007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Read the full story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scale stuck on the same number for months?&lt;/p&gt;

1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Researchers have discovered a way to potentially control the metabolic adaptation that stalls weight loss. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Liubomir – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/persons/ravnskjaer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kim Ravnskjaer&lt;/a&gt;, a molecular biology professor at the university, acknowledged that weight loss “usually goes well at first, but as people lose some of the weight they aim to shed, their progress stalls because the body’s metabolism adapts.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new study suggests that we might be able to control this metabolic adaptation — which would be a total game-changer. &lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;“If we could develop a medication that helps maintain fat or sugar burning at its original high level alongside weight-loss treatments, people could continue losing weight beyond the usual plateau,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ravnskjaer and his team researched the role of a gene called Plvap in the livers of mice. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They were aware from previous studies that people born without this gene tend to have issues with their lipid metabolism — the processes by which the body breaks down, transports and utilizes fats (lipids) for energy, storage and cellular functions — and they wanted to explore the connection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What they found was that this gene is largely responsible for controlling the metabolic shift of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/24/health/lose-belly-fat-fast-just-stop-eating-this-one-type-of-food/"&gt;burning sugar to fat&lt;/a&gt; while in “starvation mode.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the gene was deactivated in laboratory mice, the liver failed to recognize the fasting state and continued metabolizing sugar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This signals there might be a way to “trick” the liver into &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/09/health/a-berry-juice-can-boost-metabolism-and-may-help-burn-fat-study/"&gt;speeding up metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we can control the liver’s burning of sugar and fat, we might also increase the effectiveness of weight-loss and diabetes medications,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Ravnskjaer said. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Another exciting discovery was that the mice showed no negative effects throughout the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, they seemed to have &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/31/health/experts-reveal-how-to-manage-your-blood-sugar-and-weight-d/"&gt;lower blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; and improved insulin sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s well known that elevated blood sugar may lead to chronic complications for people with type 2 diabetes,” Ravnskjaer said. “Understanding Plvap could help diabetics better regulate their blood sugar in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sdu.dk/da/om-sdu/fakulteterne/naturvidenskab/nyheder/fedt-stofskifte-kim-ravnskjaer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The study’s findings&lt;/a&gt; were published Monday in the journal Cell Metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research has been limited to mice so far, and human trials are still a ways away. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is a long way from insights in mouse experiments to bringing a drug to the market — but this is obviously the potential in our research,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p data-start="144" data-end="531"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging is often seen as an inevitable decline in strength and energy, but Richard Morgan, at 93 years old, is proving otherwise. With a body composition more typical of someone in their 40s, he has shattered expectations of what’s possible in later life. His secret? A disciplined fitness routine, a protein-rich diet, and an unyielding commitment to staying active.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="144" data-end="531"&gt;&lt;span id="more-3878"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="533" data-end="753"&gt;While many assume that maintaining muscle mass and cardiovascular fitness past a certain age is unrealistic, &lt;strong data-start="642" data-end="750"&gt;Morgan is living proof that the human body is capable of incredible adaptation—no matter how old you are&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="755" data-end="783"&gt;A Body That Defies Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="785" data-end="1097"&gt;Researchers have been astounded by Morgan’s &lt;strong data-start="829" data-end="863"&gt;exceptional physical condition&lt;/strong&gt;. His &lt;strong data-start="869" data-end="917"&gt;heart health, muscle mass, and lung capacity&lt;/strong&gt; rival those of people half his age. Weighing &lt;strong data-start="963" data-end="979"&gt;76 kilograms&lt;/strong&gt;, his body is composed of &lt;strong data-start="1005" data-end="1036"&gt;80% muscle and just 15% fat&lt;/strong&gt;—figures that would make even younger athletes take notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1099" data-end="1341"&gt;One of the most striking indicators of his fitness is his &lt;strong data-start="1157" data-end="1204"&gt;heart rate during a 2,000-meter rowing test&lt;/strong&gt;, which peaks at &lt;strong data-start="1221" data-end="1245"&gt;153 beats per minute&lt;/strong&gt;. This level of cardiovascular endurance is virtually unheard of &lt;strong data-start="1310" data-end="1338"&gt;for someone in their 90s&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1343" data-end="1660"&gt;Experts stress that &lt;strong data-start="1363" data-end="1405"&gt;his physique isn’t just a genetic gift&lt;/strong&gt;—it’s the result of &lt;strong data-start="1425" data-end="1481"&gt;years of dedication to training and proper nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;. According to &lt;strong data-start="1496" data-end="1512"&gt;Scott Trappe&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the Human Performance Laboratory at &lt;strong data-start="1562" data-end="1587"&gt;Ball State University&lt;/strong&gt;, “The body retains its ability to adapt to exercise, even in old age.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="1662" data-end="1700"&gt;It’s Never Too Late to Get Strong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1702" data-end="1978"&gt;What makes Morgan’s journey even more &lt;strong data-start="1740" data-end="1754"&gt;remarkable&lt;/strong&gt; is that he didn’t start competitive rowing until he was &lt;strong data-start="1811" data-end="1827"&gt;70 years old&lt;/strong&gt;. Many people believe that if they didn’t build strength when they were younger, it’s too late—but Morgan’s story &lt;strong data-start="1941" data-end="1975"&gt;challenges that notion head-on&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1980" data-end="2165"&gt;Scientists studying &lt;strong data-start="2000" data-end="2040"&gt;human aging and physical performance&lt;/strong&gt; have been closely following his progress, seeing it as &lt;strong data-start="2096" data-end="2162"&gt;proof that muscle loss and decline don’t have to be inevitable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2167" data-end="2416"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2167" data-end="2185"&gt;Bas Van Hooren&lt;/strong&gt;, a researcher at &lt;strong data-start="2203" data-end="2228"&gt;Maastricht University&lt;/strong&gt;, reinforces this idea: “The belief that growing older means inevitable decline is a myth. &lt;strong data-start="2319" data-end="2412"&gt;Morgan’s transformation proves that anyone, at any age, can regain strength and endurance&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2418" data-end="2464"&gt;The Fitness Routine That Keeps Him Strong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2466" data-end="2618"&gt;So, how does he do it? Morgan follows a &lt;strong data-start="2506" data-end="2552"&gt;structured yet surprisingly simple routine&lt;/strong&gt;, focusing on consistency over complexity. His program includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul data-start="2620" data-end="2797"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2620" data-end="2673"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2622" data-end="2647"&gt;Rowing for 40 minutes&lt;/strong&gt; multiple times per week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2674" data-end="2723"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2676" data-end="2697"&gt;Strength training&lt;/strong&gt; to preserve muscle mass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2724" data-end="2797"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2726" data-end="2749"&gt;A high-protein diet&lt;/strong&gt;, consuming &lt;strong data-start="2761" data-end="2795"&gt;over 60 grams of protein daily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2799" data-end="3102"&gt;His &lt;strong data-start="2803" data-end="2825"&gt;nutrition strategy&lt;/strong&gt; plays a critical role in his longevity. According to &lt;strong data-start="2879" data-end="2897"&gt;Philip Jakeman&lt;/strong&gt;, professor of &lt;strong data-start="2912" data-end="2954"&gt;healthy aging and physical performance&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;strong data-start="2962" data-end="2988"&gt;University of Limerick&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="2990" data-end="3033"&gt;exercise combined with proper nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong data-start="3037" data-end="3099"&gt;the key to preserving muscle and staying strong at any age&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3104" data-end="3133"&gt;Lessons We Can All Learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3135" data-end="3433"&gt;Morgan’s story is &lt;strong data-start="3153" data-end="3176"&gt;a powerful reminder&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;strong data-start="3182" data-end="3248"&gt;staying fit isn’t about age—it’s about consistency and mindset&lt;/strong&gt;. While not everyone will take up rowing competitively in their 70s, his journey highlights a &lt;strong data-start="3342" data-end="3358"&gt;simple truth&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong data-start="3360" data-end="3430"&gt;small, regular efforts can lead to extraordinary results over time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3435" data-end="3772" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""&gt;The takeaway? &lt;strong data-start="3449" data-end="3516"&gt;Start today, stay consistent, and choose an &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/i-lost-5kg-in-2-months-by-doing-this-easy-activity/"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt; you enjoy.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether it’s &lt;strong data-start="3530" data-end="3579"&gt;walking, lifting weights, swimming, or rowing&lt;/strong&gt;, the human body is far more adaptable than most people believe. And as &lt;strong data-start="3651" data-end="3669"&gt;Richard Morgan&lt;/strong&gt; has shown, &lt;strong data-start="3681" data-end="3771"&gt;it’s never too late to become stronger, healthier, and more energetic than ever before.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sexe95008y2cpceyiodr6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a measles outbreak in Texas has grown to nearly 150 cases, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;opinion piece on Fox News&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday that parents should consult with health-care providers “to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine” for their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w500063b6mzlcqqosb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy did not explicitly recommend the vaccine, but said the outbreak was a “call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w500073b6mjw3jjn45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” Kennedy wrote. “Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w500083b6myj38r0w0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s statement on measles vaccination appeared in the piece after a paragraph emphasizing treatment, such as vitamin A, for people who are sick. There is no approved antiviral to treat measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w500093b6mmrrraxo8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also wrote that health-care providers, leaders and policymakers need to ensure that “accurate information about vaccine safety and efficacy is disseminated. We must engage with communities to understand their concerns, provide culturally competent education, and make vaccines readily accessible for all those who want them.” In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1895585297351799198" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, Kennedy had said that HHS was providing technical support and vaccines to the state of Texas, as well as lab support, outreach materials in Low German — a language commonly used by the Mennonite community in West Texas — and daily communication with local officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm7sfwzxo00073b6mx01rhdx3@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w5000a3b6mcgyifq9o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, Kennedy’s vaccine comments are in striking contrast to those from former &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/health/us-measles-cases-1000-bn/index.html"&gt;HHS Sec. Alex Azar&lt;/a&gt; during the last large measles outbreak in 2019: “We cannot say this enough: Vaccines are a safe and highly effective public health tool that can prevent this disease and end the current outbreak. The measles vaccine is among the most-studied medical products we have and is given safely to millions of children and adults each year. I encourage all Americans to talk to your doctor about what vaccines are recommended to protect you, your family, and your community from measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w5000b3b6m9afe61iw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has a history of antivaccine comments, including saying “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/01/politics/rfk-jr-fact-check-confirmation-heading/index.html"&gt;no vaccine is safe and effective&lt;/a&gt;” and tying vaccines to the rise in autism.  Studies have found the  &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is safe and effective: Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective and studies have shown there’s no link between autism and the MMR vaccine. During the Texas outbreak, the US Centers for Disease Control and local health officials have continued to recommend vaccination against measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w5000c3b6mvwghdazd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, MMR vaccine coverage is declining across the country. For four years, the US has fallen short of the 95% threshold set by HHS to help prevent outbreaks of the highly contagious disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w5000d3b6m6azo5534@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreak in West Texas has led to 146 measles cases since late January, the majority of them among people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. There have been 20 patients hospitalized and one death, an unvaccinated school-age child, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. It’s the largest outbreak the state has seen in 30 years, officials say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w5000e3b6mtcy4g12k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When asked about the outbreak during President Donald Trump’s first cabinet meeting last week, Kennedy said that  “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/health/kennedy-measles-outbreaks-us/index.html"&gt;measles outbreaks are not unusual.”&lt;/a&gt; However, measles was eliminated in the US in 2000. Experts say some cases are still expected — particularly imported cases associated with international travel — and the US has reported at least a dozen cases each year since reaching elimination status, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC. However, infectious disease experts and local health officials said outbreaks the size and speed of the Texas outbreak are unusual since vaccination became available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w5000f3b6mczy36vsl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the decade before the introduction of the MMR vaccine in 1963, there were 400 to 500 US measles deaths per year. Until the death of the child in Texas, there had not been a measles death in the US since &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/02/health/us-measles-death/index.html"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; and the country had not seen a measles death in a child since &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5331a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w5000g3b6mpusjox2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles cases have risen in recent years, with 285 US cases reported last year, the most since 2019 when &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/15/health/measles-2019-us-global-cdc-who-bn/index.html"&gt;prolonged outbreaks among under vaccinated communities&lt;/a&gt; in New York threatened elimination status, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=There%20have%20been%2016%20outbreaks,59)%20were%20outbreak%2Dassociated." target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Declining vaccination rates are driving up the number of cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

              &lt;/div&gt;

A diverse diet was particularly effective in preventing a food allergy for those without a family history of food allergies or history of eczema. But earlier introduction of a diverse diet, at 6 months, did not show the same reduction in food allergy risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F2GV4I2DIZCI3JGDI5A4VBB3PQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Parents filled out food consumption questionnaires when their children reached about 9 months of age.

However, this extremely rare case happened in China, and the researchers are yet to understand its underlying cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, a Chinese memory clinic diagnosed a 19-year-old with Alzheimer's disease, making him the world's youngest-ever Alzheimer's patient. The teenage boy started experiencing memory issues at 17 and with time his cognitive health deteriorated, so much so that he couldn't even complete his high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain of the young patient was found to have shrinkage in the hippocampus involved with memory, and his cerebrospinal fluid hinted at common signs of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What made this case puzzling and unique to Capital Medical University in Beijing researchers was that the patient didn't have a gene mutation that could put his case in the case of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), which may happen in case of early onset disease. The teenager also didn't have any other disease, infection, or head trauma that could explain his sudden cognitive decline. The case was detailed in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the memory decline began?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teenager started facing trouble focusing in his class two years before his diagnosis. Not only he found reading difficult but also faced decline in short-term memory. He also couldn't remember events from the day before, and often misplaced his belongings. The young man unfortunately couldn't complete his high school, though he could still live independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The cause remains a mystery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to WHO, Alzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia and may contribute to 60–70% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 10% cases of Alzheimer's disease are early onset but all the patients who are under 30 years of age can have their Alzheimer's explained by pathological gene mutations. This puts them into the category of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). In the case of young people, the likely cause is a faulty gene. In this particular case, however, the researchers couldn't find any such mutation or gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The patient had very early-onset AD with no clear pathogenic mutations," neurologist Jianping Jia and colleagues wrote in their study, "which suggests that its pathogenesis still needs to be explored.""Exploring the mysteries of young people with Alzheimer's disease may become one of the most challenging scientific questions of the future," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Causes of young-onset dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The causes of young-onset dementia are similar to the diseases that leads to dementia in older people. In case of young, as per Alzheimer's Society, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), is more common. Dementia in younger people also has different symptoms than those reported in older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Familial Alzheimer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Familial Alzheimer’s disease is an extremely rare form of Alzheimer’s caused by inherited genetic mutations. It involves changes in three specific genes — PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP — and carries a 50% chance of being passed from parent to child. People with this condition often have a strong family history of Alzheimer’s, with symptoms typically appearing in their 30s, 40s, or 50s. The earlier the onset, the more likely the disease is linked to genetics. Overall, familial Alzheimer’s accounts for fewer than 1% of all Alzheimer’s cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;p data-type="image" data-title="alzheimers disease" data-msid="118688283" data-hostid="83" data-src="/img/118688283/Master.jpg"&gt;&lt;msid&gt;118688283&lt;/msid&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Atypical Alzheimer's disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Younger people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease are more likely to have an atypical form, where the symptoms differ from the typical memory loss seen in older adults. In posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), early signs involve problems processing visual information, such as difficulty reading or judging distances. In logopenic aphasia, language difficulties appear first, with individuals struggling to find the right words or pausing frequently during speech. Meanwhile, behavioural/dysexecutive Alzheimer’s disease tends to start with problems in planning, decision-making, and socially inappropriate behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Older adults infected with COVID-19 at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease: Study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 14:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>JFK International Airport on red alert as foreign traveler imports deadly disease and infects untold number - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxNT1dORVZOa1NETzNVMWJtQ1RXWEd3LVNuWTNjeWRiU08xSnNQNk5leGVOM0hfQmlkVG1wYU43a1B5aHp5ZExjdFJxc291dFNRc29VOU1Cek1pb3FQWUZrNHJ2alJIRlNicGNtZzdwaUJueVZXU2ZfU2lTQWstNjdoVjM4TVZJbnJNck42TmNlZmpCc1hVX09rczhmUmdKZGIxUHYwNtIBqgFBVV95cUxNcVZvbTUzUlBZcFZYbm8waVhSdzZBdDl1M1V6cGdIZlY4OG42SGo3MWxWSWFpT2loVHRieDVVU3FpaGd1RzFsMHVaQWxLdVdrbDMza19GcE13aVV0b1RlWk5ucDZZYUdvZWpuaTV3MzlQTncza3BmVUotbjdTbEVBUTJHS0VtRE1mV19TcUg0V3ZwbUloX083SWFrc3BCUW9ISGRXNG4wU3A0UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials have &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6536883/Measles-fears-New-Jersey-airport.html" class=""&gt;warned about a potential measles outbreak at New York's JFK International Airport.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A child who entered the country on a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-3b4e85b0-f83d-11ef-8208-d9edec91456a" class=""&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; Airlines flight has tested positive for the highly contagious disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After arriving at Terminal 4, the patient traveled on a shuttle bus to Philadelphia where they visited two clinics and were eventually diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone who was on the shuttle bus on February 25 between 9.30pm and 3.15am is being urged to get tested for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who were also at a clinic in Collegeville, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-92f21e20-f839-11ef-8208-d9edec91456a" class=""&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, on February 26 from 11.45am to 2.15pm, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia King of Prussia campus, from 12.52am to 3.02pm, are also being advised to get tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials are now working to trace patients who may have crossed paths with the child, who is a US national but had not been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes after &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14443287/us-airport-disease-lockdown-deadly-illness.html"&gt;a passenger at LAX who arrived on a Korean Air flight&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating a version of the low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet for six months led to an anti-inflammatory shift in immune cell populations among people with stable, &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS) in a Phase 2 trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes were accompanied by metabolic alterations in the immune cells that researchers believe could influence their activation state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were detailed by Michael Kornberg, MD, PhD, assistant professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2025, held Feb. 27-March 1 in West Palm Beach, Florida, and online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line to me is that it is just further evidence that you really can modify immune phenotypes [characteristics] with dietary interventions,” Kornberg said in a talk titled, “&lt;a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/20973/presentation/600"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Six-Month Ketogenic Diet Alters The Immune And Metabolic Landscape In Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Immune cell activity and MS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro-inflammatory immune cell activity plays a key role in driving autoimmune diseases including &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS), in which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolic processes, including the chemical reactions through which energy is produced, influence immune cells’ activation state. Researchers believe therapeutics that modify immune cell metabolism could benefit people with MS or other autoimmune conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“&lt;/b&gt;If you can modify metabolism with drugs, then theoretically you can also do it with dietary interventions,” Kornberg said. But while animal studies have indeed indicated that diet can influence immune responses, “rigorous evidence in humans has been quite sparse,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the diets proposed to be of possible benefit in MS is the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/living-with-ms/ms-diet-nutrition/healthy-eating-ms/#Special_MS_Diets"&gt;ketogenic diet&lt;/a&gt;, a type of low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet that leads to ketosis, a state in which the body burns fat instead of sugar to produce energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modified Atkins diet, or MAD, is a less restrictive version of the ketogenic diet that doesn’t require the same degree of carbohydrate limitation, and may therefore be “more palatable for long-term adherence,” Kornberg said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A now-completed &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03718247"&gt;Phase 2 study (NCT03718247)&lt;/a&gt; evaluated the potential benefits of a six-month MAD diet in 65 relapsing MS patients with stable disease, ages 12-55.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/93/6/637"&gt;Results showed&lt;/a&gt; that it led to significant improvements in physical function, life quality, and body composition, as well as reductions in fatigue and depression. Patients also reported an &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2023/08/02/benefits-ketogenic-diet-rrms-may-be-long-lasting-if-adherence/"&gt;easing of a number of other MS-related symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined blood and immune cells collected from 39 trial participants at the start of the study and after six months on the MAD diet, aiming to characterize the diet’s effects on immune cell function and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The composition and gene activity profiles of immune cell subsets were substantially altered after six months on the MAD diet and generally showed a shift toward an anti-inflammatory profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myeloid cells, including dendritic cells and monocytes, exhibited reduced activity of genes associated with pro-inflammatory pathways. They also produced fewer pro-inflammatory molecules after the six-month diet, and levels of such molecules circulating in the blood were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diet was also associated with alterations in the abundance of various types of T-cells, favoring less inflammatory populations. In particular, regulatory T-cells, which have anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the activation of other immune cell types, exhibited an increased abundance with the diet and showed signs of being more active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levels of B-cells, a class of antibody-producing immune cells believed to drive inflammation in MS, were not altered with the diet, but these cells showed gene activity changes consistent with decreased activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional analyses of blood metabolites showed that the six-month MAD diet altered a variety of metabolites, including ones related to cellular energy production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data suggested that the metabolic pathways immune cells used for energy generation were altered with the diet. Before the diet, the cells seemed to favor breaking down sugar for energy (glycolysis), whereas after it, they favored using fat molecules (fatty acid oxidation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was evidenced by reduced levels of GLUT1, a molecule involved in transporting sugar into cells, after the six-month diet, along with increases in CPT1a, an enzyme involved in fatty acid oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kornberg said these altered pathways are “ones that you would expect to be particularly relevant for immune cell activation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether these immune cell alterations are enough to influence clinical outcomes for MS patients is not yet known, nor is it clear exactly through which mechanisms MAD might influence immune function, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term safety of ketogenic diets in patients also remains to be established, “which is a critical point if a patient is thinking about embarking on this,” Kornberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the &lt;a href="https://www.dorisduke.org/"&gt;Doris Duke Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.mayerfoundation.com/"&gt;Mayer Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Officials said that child may have exposed people to the illness, including in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The child was in Philadelphia from 9:30 p.m. Tuesday to 3:15 a.m. Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They arrived at the Pho Ha Saigon restaurant, 757 Adams Ave. in Philadelphia, on a China Airlines Airport Shuttle Bus that came from Terminal 4 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The child then was at True North Pediatrics Associates of Plymouth, 3031 Walton Rd., #C101, in Plymouth Meeting on Wednesday, and then at the CHOP King of Prussia Campus Emergency Department on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were at any of these locations during the identified time periods may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investigators are completing contact tracing in coordination with the health care systems above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identified individuals are in the process of being contacted and notified of potential exposure to measles and assessed for vaccination status and risk for infection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles virus can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area. If someone breathes in the contaminated air or touches an infected surface and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth, they can become infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know Your Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing measles. For individuals who are properly immunized against measles, the risk of getting the disease is minimal. Individuals who believe they were exposed should:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review their immunization and medical records to determine if they are protected against measles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consult with their health care provider about receiving measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunization if they have not had measles infection or received the measles immunization previously. Contact and notify their health care provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if they are pregnant, have an infant (child under the age of 1 year old), have a weakened immune system, and/or are not vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor themselves for illness with fever and/or an unexplained rash, cough, congestion or runny nose, or red watery eyes (conjunctivitis) from 7 days to 21 days after their exposure (the time period when symptoms may develop). If symptoms develop, stay at home and call a health care provider immediately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is a reportable disease in Pennsylvania. If you suspect that you or your child have measles and wish to seek care, please call your health care provider, urgent care, or hospital emergency room before leaving home, or contact the Office of Public Health at 610-278-5117 to facilitate a safe visit and reduce exposure for staff and other patients. Health care providers should report suspected cases of measles immediately to the Montgomery County Office of Public Health at 610-278-5117 or after hours at 610-635-4300.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Individuals are considered to be immune to measles if any of the following applies:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They were born in 1957 or earlier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They have had 2 doses of Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They have had measles disease. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The following groups of people are potentially susceptible to measles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Infants who are too young to have been immunized (less than one year of age).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children who are only partially vaccinated (less than 6 years old).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persons who were vaccinated with an inactivated or unknown type of vaccine, which was used from 1963 through 1967, and have not been revaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some persons born after 1957 who have only received one dose of vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those who have refused vaccination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those from areas of the world where there is low vaccine coverage or currently circulating measles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immune-compromised persons, such as organ transplant recipients, patients receiving chemotherapy and people living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Individuals who meet the above criteria or cannot verify their immune status should consult with their primary healthcare provider about the best way to protect themselves from measles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Measles is an extremely contagious virus that lives in the mucus membranes of the nose and throat of infected people. Measles can be transmitted from person to person through coughing and sneezing. If a healthy person breathes the contaminated air or touches an infected surface, then touches their eyes, nose or mouth they can become infected. When an infected person sneezes or coughs, droplets spray into the air and those droplets can contain active and contagious virus which will last in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles typically begins with a fever (100.4 degree Fahrenheit or higher) that lasts for several days, followed by a cough, runny nose, and watery eyes (conjunctivitis). Two to three days after symptoms begin, tiny white spots (Koplik spots) may appear in the mouth. Three to five days after symptoms begin, a flat red spotted rash appears beginning on face at the hairline and spreads downwards to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. The flat red spots may also be joined by small, raised bumps. Symptoms appear about seven to 14 days on average after exposure but can be as long as 21 days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is preventable with two doses of MMR vaccine which is available at your local healthcare provider or pharmacy. The Montgomery Office of Public Health can assist by providing recommendations for testing, outbreak prevention, and disease management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For questions, call the Montgomery County Office of Public Health at 610-278-5117.

This correlated with two separate markers of the disease: the tau protein and a protein tag called ubiquitin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even more compellingly, the team identified these toxic gingipains in the brains of deceased people who were never diagnosed with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't Miss:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/entertainment/celebrity-news/164244/carrie-underwood-lean-on-lionel-richie-in-american-idol-astrology"&gt;Carrie Underwood will 'lean on Lionel Richie' in American Idol, astrologist reveals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/us-news/164259/fox-news-jesse-watters-begs-trump-spare-doged-pal"&gt;Fox News' Jesse Watters begs for 'callous' Trump administration to spare 'DOGE'd' pal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/entertainment/tv/162846/antqiues-roadshow-guest-drops-expletive-gift-hollywood-icon"&gt;Antiques Roadshow guest nearly drops expletive as gift from Hollywood icon gets huge value&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is significant because while P. gingivalis and the disease have been linked before, it's never been known – to put it simply – whether gum disease causes Alzheimer's, or, alternatively, dementia leads to poor oral care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that low levels of gingipains were evident even in people who were never diagnosed with Alzheimer's could be a warning sign – suggesting they might have developed the brain condition if they had lived longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our identification of gingipain antigens in the brains of individuals with AD and also with AD pathology but no diagnosis of dementia argues that brain infection with P. gingivalis is not a result of poor dental care following the onset of dementia or a consequence of late-stage disease, but is an early event that can explain the pathology found in middle-aged individuals before cognitive decline," the authors explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 13:55:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNTmZHMmRsX2pZWTdqM3dBN0ZoNGt5a3FVcklBREIzVWNHQVZOV2JfOU5HQXFBME5LaHJTY3U0OFN6R0R5NDdxa29zMjZDbHRaQ3BqVEllMTVWLTg0dzhKQXk3TFVmSFd4LWEtUmo3alVkZUVmaGNLWFdRN1JJYTFrN2hn0gGHAUFVX3lxTE56ZFBSOVNYM3VrM2hMUzEtUzNrVmVGcHZzM0YxdWZyYUJDZmJJdzV2ejRKWk50NFpaYVJLSlNWaS1iU1gwcmFldTFYMTdjSmdWdUludzE2aGRUcVJodUJ1d1lmenZCNmIxLWgtcXBlLUwxaEJVWHZtcDE1aEpKQ3ZPZFpKUXRnaw</guid></item><item><title>'At 54, my metabolic age is 35 – here’s how you can lower yours' - Women's Health UK</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxNNFFfRWlhY1hPNHVBcHBNVno2QWM0eXR5ckNMSXEteGNKZzREVjhpRXJvd0dUQWY0STk1cEZyOU5IWU1aUy0ySkg3UzlkVWQ1MHY3Z2xnR1hmcnRkUVUzNlhleDNCbXNzc18wMFZqRWlua21UY0Zlbl9KYmJoNWMxdnJLYXJ6cVJrZl90c0lvQzh0eUEzQjBJV1U0a3ViRjhPcU1SSkR5YnhSRGY5amxj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Four years after she started lifting weights, 54-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAA3usSIsgg/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAA3usSIsgg/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Annie Murray" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Annie Murray&lt;/a&gt; now has the metabolic age of a 35-year-old.

If you’re not increasing the intensity of your workouts, it’s easy to hit a plateau. To keep seeing gains in strength and muscle, try adding a bit more weight, a few more reps or doing an extra set every few weeks. You could also decrease the rest time between sets, add in some supersets or drop sets, or slow down the tempo of reps. This will keep your muscles guessing and growing.’ &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="20" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recovery and rest&lt;/strong&gt;. ‘Your body needs plenty of time to recover and build muscle, especially for women during menopause. If you’re not getting enough rest between workouts or enough sleep, it can slow down your progress and even lead to overtraining. Try to prioritise your sleep and make sure to take rest days or include active recovery to give your body the time it needs to bounce back stronger. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="21" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;. ‘Eating the right foods is crucial for muscle repair and growth. Without enough protein and the right nutrients, your progress might stall, and your energy levels could drop, making workouts harder. Focus on a balanced diet with plenty of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs. Try to include 20-30 grams of protein in each meal to support muscle growth. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="22" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technique&lt;/strong&gt;. ‘Good technique is critical.

What we do after our workout matters, so increasing our movement and trying to walk more is important. When I turned 50, I got a dog, and that’s when I started walking daily. I didn’t realise then what this simple yet powerful, low-impact exercise could bring. It strengthens my heart, improves circulation, lowers blood pressure, reduces risk of heart disease and stroke, boosts metabolism, strengthens bones and muscles and more.’ &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="24" class="body-h4 css-lviy4r emevuu60"&gt;5 things that happened to my body when I started to strength train after 50 &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="26" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'My body composition began to change&lt;/strong&gt;.

I did this because I had started to suffer symptoms of anxiety and heart palpitations if I’d been out for a few drinks the night before. Once I stopped, the symptoms went away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'Two years later, as I entered menopause, I faced new challenges such as low energy and mood, sluggishness, fatigue, bloating. I was never dependent on alcohol, but I did enjoy it. Social events always seemed to revolve around drinking, and I believed that to truly have fun, alcohol had to be part of the equation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'When I entered perimenopause in my 40s, everything changed. I faced low moods, sleepless nights, and hot flushes. At the time, I didn’t connect these symptoms to perimenopause—I just felt like I was losing my grip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'During this challenging time, my relationship with alcohol started to shift. Nights out often left me feeling anxious, with heart palpitations that I couldn’t ignore. I tried moderating my drinking, limiting it to weekends. But in my world, weekends sometimes started on Thursday—or Wednesday if the week had been tough. Trying to moderate became exhausting. After one too many mornings spent regretting the aftermath of “fun,” I knew it was time for change. I owed it to myself—my body, my mind, and my well-being.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'On the 10th of December 2017, I decided to stop drinking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'It’s not an exaggeration to say that my life has completely transformed.

I don’t need alcohol to enjoy myself. I still love socialising, dining out, and dancing, but now I do it with a clear mind, more energy, and more money in my pocket. Best of all, I wake up every day feeling level-headed, focused and full of energy. No more lost Sundays recovering from hangovers, no anxiety, and no heart palpitations after a night out. These days, I’m at the gym by 7 a.m., ready to seize the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘Seven years on, I’m happier, healthier and fitter and not once have I ever woken up thinking, “I wish I had a drink last night!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="31" class="body-h4 css-lviy4r emevuu60"&gt;How exercise can help break unhealthy habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;‘When you try to break the habit, things become tricky. Without the ‘feel good’ hit, you might feel cravings, irritability, or stress. However, from my experience, I have learned that you CAN completely rewire the brain, and the key is to trick your brain into believing that it is still getting a reward. That’s where exercise is your secret weapon!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘Here’s how exercise can help you break unhealthy habits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="33" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li&gt;‘&lt;strong&gt;Boosts feel-good chemicals:&lt;/strong&gt; When you exercise, your body releases the same mood-boosting chemicals, dopamine and endorphins, which also help relieve pain and reduce stress. So, when trying to break an unhealthy habit, try to replace it with a workout or a walk, giving you the same ‘feel-good’ vibe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;‘&lt;strong&gt;Reduces cravings: &lt;/strong&gt;Physical activity helps distract your brain from cravings and also reduces stress, making it easier to resist temptation. Remember that cravings are temporary, and your brain is adaptable. Stick with it, and over time, your brain will adjust, and your cravings will fade as your new habit takes over.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;‘&lt;strong&gt;Build new healthy habits:&lt;/strong&gt; By replacing your unhealthy routine with a healthy one, such as exercise, you’re teaching your brain a healthier way to unwind. Over time, this new habit will stick, and you won’t even think about the old habit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;‘Remember, breaking a habit takes time!

Researchers monitored participants as a randomized sampling and had them take a combination of 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D and one gram of omega-3 fatty acids daily while participating in a 30-minute strength training routine three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three years of collecting blood samples, DNA extractions, and telephone calls, researchers found that 777 of those who took just the omega-3 supplement were able to lower their biological age by an estimated four months, while those who did all three saw even more significant results and were able to reduce their cancer risks by 61% while also improving their overall health. Additionally, 13% saw a reduction in infections with just the omega-3 dose, and 10% saw a reduction in falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is biological age?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological age is a term used to describe how our body ages in relation to the number of candles we have on our birthday cake each year. “[It] refers to how old our cells are and how well our tissues are functioning, which can be different from our actual chronological age,” says Suzanne Hyslop, nutrition specialist at &lt;a href="https://oceanrecoverycentre.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ocean Recovery Centre;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ocean Recovery Centre&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It is influenced by our genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does omega-3 affect aging?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.drgoodenowe.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dayan Goodenowe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dayan Goodenowe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., a neuroscientist known for his work on prodromes, which are the early biochemical indicators of disease, the primary omega-3 found in human physiology is docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). “DHA is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is essential for maintaining the youthful fluidity of the body’s membranes,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while our bodies can make DHA from the essential omega-3 dietary fatty acid, as we get older, Goodenowe says our ability to make DHA decreases and the oxidative stress on our bodies increases. “These two factors contribute to our membranes becoming stiffer and less pliable as we age, in other words, ‘older.’"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dietary supplementation of DHA helps reduce the effects of aging on our membranes by ensuring that the body’s membranes have optimal DHA levels, he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3s also have anti-inflammatory properties, according to Hyslop, which may also contribute to the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can vitamin D and strength training slow biological aging?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training is not just about muscle growth, Goodenowe says. It’s also about increasing bone density. He says that this type of exercise can stimulate your bones to grow stronger to meet the demands of your muscles, combatting some of the frailty we associate with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a44536812/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;most of us &lt;/em&gt;aren’t getting enough in our daily diets without adding a supplement, according to Goodenowe, which means the majority of people are already at a deficit, which may put our health at risk at any age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin D is essential for bone health and immune function,” Hyslop adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you really keep your body from aging?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because getting older and losing function appear to go hand in hand, Goodenowe says we equate aging with a loss of function. As such, he says we think that aging &lt;em&gt;causes &lt;/em&gt;this loss of function, like a disease. Instead, he believes the opposite is true, and it’s the “loss of function” that causes aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To slow aging you need to focus on maintaining function,” he says. That means staying on top of diet and exercise and adding supplements to your diet to compensate for the things your changing body needs as you get older. After checking with your healthcare provider first, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyslop agrees. “Physical activity, sleep, stress management, and avoiding harmful habits like smoking are also important,” she continues. “Staying socially connected and mentally active contributes to overall well-being, which can positively influence biological aging but this is often overlooked.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1qWVFrc0VtT25rUnhZXzZjQXdDMGI3YTRhRFJUNjhBbU82TE9uTGkybHZqM04zOE03a3RlZ2lqams2T0tteF8zWEpGNGpoNXNDcE13MnpmLUJtWUc3am9naTdmX3Vmc0pJZjZMMTR1Q0R2Sy12S05rWQ</guid></item><item><title>A simple diet change can reverse arthritis within eight weeks, says Stanford expert - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most painful and debilitating conditions affecting your joints and their movements, arthritis can be difficult to manage and live with. There are over 100 types of arthritis, but two major types - osteoarthritis develops with age, and rheumatoid arthritis - an autoimmune condition are more talked about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to managing the chronic joint condition, diet can play an important role. But can certain changes in your dietary pattern reverse arthritis? A leading rheumatology expert believes it’s possible. Dr. Tamiko Katsumoto, a clinical associate professor at Stanford University, claims that switching to an anti-inflammatory diet could make a huge difference in just eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on a recent episode of the ZOE Health podcast to Jonathan Wolf, Dr Katsumoto explained how certain simple dietary changes could not only reduce pain and stiffness but also "reverse arthritis in eight weeks".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to manage or slow down arthritis can make a great difference as one is able to carry out their day-to-day tasks with ease and also able to do exercises recommended by experts, which can further support joint health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katsumoto spoke about the foods that can play an important role in managing and potentially reversing arthritis symptoms. Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katsumoto, said that although there was no cure for arthritis, certain factors like diet, lifestyle changes and medicine, can help slow down its symptoms and manage them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expert agrees that it's possible to reverse arthritis with the right foods. She said: "I think the biggest myth is that there's nothing you can do to change your arthritis course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there are actually a lot of things that we are all capable of doing through diet, lifestyle, etc, that can make a difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The right diet for arthritis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katsumoto, says the right changes in diet can help in reversing arthritis symptoms in eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the right diet for arthritis, she says switching to an anti-inflammatory diet could have a "profound impact".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that inflammatory foods, like processed products, can raise the risk of getting a chronic health condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mediterranean diet (MD) as an anti-inflammatory is advised by The American College of Rheumatology for people with arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katsumoto was all praise for the Blue Zone diet, which includes a lot of plant-based foods, fish, grains, seeds, nuts, pulses, beans and lentils., and cuts out dairy and meat products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best vegetables for arthritis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expert said the 'best' anti-inflammatory vegetables were "cruciferous vegetables" like broccoli, kale, cauliflower, and deep leafy greens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arthritis can affect hands and wrists, knees, hips, feet and ankles, shoulders, and lower back (lumbar spine). Some of the common symptoms of arthritis include joint pain, stiffness or reduced range of motion, swelling, skin discoloration, tenderness or sensitivity to touch around a joint, and a feeling of heat or warmth near your joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some types of arthritis can have symptoms in waves that come and go called flare-ups while others make your joints feel painful or stiff all the time, or after being physically active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arthritis can develop for many reasons, ranging from natural wear and tear to immune system malfunctions. Osteoarthritis is often linked to aging, as years of joint use gradually wear down cartilage. Gout can occur when excess uric acid builds up in the blood, while autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis happen when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy joints. In some cases, viral infections — including Covid-19 — can also trigger arthritis symptoms. And in certain instances, arthritis develops without any clear cause, a condition known as idiopathic arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katsumoto also talked about Plants for Joints as an exciting randomized controlled trial that tested a six-pillar lifestyle intervention in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and metabolic-associated osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 16 weeks, participants followed changes in diet, exercise, stress management, sleep, social connection, and substance avoidance. By the eight-week mark, patients showed dramatic improvements in joint symptoms, with rheumatoid arthritis patients seeing significant reductions in disease activity scores. While the program addressed multiple lifestyle factors, diet appeared to play the biggest role in these improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think diet played a huge role. And what they did was they educated these patients on whole food plant-based diets. So minimizing processed foods, minimizing or mostly eliminating animal products, increasing fiber intake, and really trying to encompass a very healthy whole food diet. The same thing was done for osteoarthritis," said the expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Seeds for arthritis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katsumoto says chia seeds and flax seeds are perfect foods as they are high in fibre, omega-3, and protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've just got so many great components that I add them to my smoothies. I just try to incorporate them wherever I can. I get a big bottle of them and add them wherever I can," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oily fish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another superfood that can reduce inflammation according to the expert is omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That being said, I also encourage my patients to not go too heavy on fish, to eat the smaller fish, so not so much the tuna and the swordfish, you know, things that are much larger and can end up bio accumulating things like heavy metals and toxins," she said during the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Go easy on the eggs: 'Egg-cess' consumption linked to diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 13:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Get caught up on measles shots before spring break, Colorado state epidemiologist says - The Denver Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNQmZoUVNKbklKNXh2NDlmQll6bGFoaC1vb0dtZlR3eXhzS043NXJyNXRxbEtCWUtEeUZhUXQwYS1BY1dOZlJ6SnVudmk2WnZGNEUtcnY3eTZPc2tBLWNKbGhXVXA2YnlOZ0poRnJXbkZDYmVydHJRRWN6OTdrX1gtYUJ6ZW_SAYoBQVVfeXFMUHg5bkRlOG9FR1FCdk5sVHVTZVRjbm1KYzJuNElJcm5ZaEo5WDJFa1hhVk90Y3RPbXY1UUM1VVRUZS1uVWJzR3M2OWozbEl4V3J1NkJIME1aSGVRdE5RMWtOd0QwOFBmVWVZb2JEMjlaazlDb0ZfdkZ2Y0NUU0xKUW9MT1VUTjRDNVpn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upcoming spring break trips will give the current measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico a chance to grow, making it particularly important for people who are behind on their shots to catch up now, Colorado’s state epidemiologist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing a concerning increase in measles cases across the country, including in states neighboring Colorado,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy said in a news release. “As Coloradans prepare for spring break and travel, it’s crucial to ensure you and your family are protected against this highly contagious and serious disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of late last week, 164 people in the United States had confirmed cases of measles — more than halfway to last year’s total of 285 in just the first two months of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those cases, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025"&gt;146 were in Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

Before the measles vaccine came on the market, 400 to 500 people died from the disease in an average year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;most likely to cause complications&lt;/a&gt; in children younger than 5 and adults older than 20. It also can be dangerous during pregnancy, causing premature birth in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles virus lingers in the air and on surfaces for about two hours. Typically, if a measles patient in the contagious phase spent time in a room, nine out of 10 people without immunity who move through that room in the following hours also will get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One dose of the measles vaccine reduces the odds of getting sick by about 93%, and two doses reduce it by 97%. People who survived measles also typically develop lifelong immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people won’t need a booster shot, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Adults vaccinated before 1968 should get another shot, because the version of the vaccine used then was less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone isn’t sure whether they were vaccinated or when it happened, they can get another shot, state health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, children receive their measles shots when they’re about 1 year old and before they start kindergarten. Families who plan to take infants who are between 6 months and 1 year on an international trip should consider getting the shot early, because the virus is more common outside the United States, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC estimated about 88.3% of Colorado kindergarteners had their shots to prevent measles, mumps and rubella, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html?utm_source=Healthbeat&amp;amp;utm_campaign=af7cea22dd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_02_27_08_56&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_-af7cea22dd-1297580565&amp;amp;mc_cid=af7cea22dd&amp;amp;mc_eid=6818060210#cdc_data_surveillance_section_8-previous-years"&gt;tying the state for the sixth-lowest vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt;. When about 95% of the population is vaccinated, the virus has difficulty finding new hosts, and outbreaks tend to fizzle out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even highly vaccinated states can have vulnerable pockets, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In New Mexico, 95% of kindergarteners had the measles vaccine in the most recent school year, but &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;nine people in a county bordering the epicenter of the Texas outbreak&lt;/a&gt; have gotten sick with the virus. Seven other states with varying vaccination rates also had a handful of cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/immunization/school-and-child-care-data"&gt;Colorado school districts with the lowest vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; are in rural parts of the state, though the Colorado Springs area also could be vulnerable. Fewer than 80% of kindergarteners in Manitou Springs School District had both doses of the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates didn’t break down neatly along ideological lines in Colorado. Both the Boulder Valley School District and the Douglas County School District reported more than 95% of their kindergarteners had both measles shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 5% of people infected so far this year nationwide had at least one dose of the vaccine. The remaining 95% includes unvaccinated people and some whose records weren’t available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in five people infected in the current outbreaks received hospital care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812"&gt;Despite statements by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, hospitals don’t provide quarantine services for measles patients — only those sick enough to need inpatient treatment get a bed. Kennedy has spread debunked claims about the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella, despite studies looking at hundreds of thousands of children that found &lt;a href="https://www.healthbeat.org/2024/07/29/4-ways-vaccine-skeptics-mislead-you-on-measles-and-more/?utm_source=Healthbeat&amp;amp;utm_campaign=af7cea22dd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_02_27_08_56&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_-af7cea22dd-1297580565&amp;amp;mc_cid=af7cea22dd&amp;amp;mc_eid=6818060210"&gt;those who received the measles vaccine were no more likely to develop autism than those who didn’t&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one in 20 children who get measles develops pneumonia, and one in 1,000 has brain swelling that can result in hearing loss or intellectual disabilities. Kids also can become dehydrated and are vulnerable to secondary infections, because the measles virus also &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/inside-immune-amnesia"&gt;attacks antibodies to other diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who have measles can start spreading the virus about four days before the distinctive rash develops, when their symptoms look much like other respiratory diseases: a high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have those symptoms should call their health care provider before coming in, so they can take precautions to limit other people’s exposure, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://myaccount.denverpost.com/dp/preference"&gt;Get more Colorado news by signing up for our Mile High Roundup email newsletter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;19-year-old&lt;/strong&gt; from China has been diagnosed with &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD)&lt;/strong&gt;, making him the youngest known patient ever recorded. The case challenges current medical assumptions about how and why the disease develops, especially in younger individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Rare Diagnosis at an Unprecedented Age&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Typically associated with the elderly, &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/strong&gt; is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that leads to cognitive decline and memory loss. Early-onset cases—those appearing before the age of 65—account for &lt;strong&gt;about 10%&lt;/strong&gt; of diagnoses. However, almost all cases in young patients are linked to genetic mutations associated with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzforum.org/early-onset-familial-ad/overview/what-early-onset-familial-alzheimer-disease-efad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;familial Alzheimer’s disease &lt;/a&gt;(FAD)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;teenage patient&lt;/strong&gt; had no family history of dementia, no genetic markers of the condition, and no prior infections or head trauma that could explain his symptoms. Yet, by the time he was referred to a &lt;strong&gt;memory clinic&lt;/strong&gt;, his cognitive abilities had already deteriorated significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Unexplained Progression of Symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patient first began experiencing memory issues &lt;strong&gt;at 17&lt;/strong&gt;, struggling with concentration and recall. Over time, his short-term memory worsened—he often forgot events from the previous day and misplaced belongings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the time he was 19, tests showed that his &lt;strong&gt;memory function was severely impaired&lt;/strong&gt;, with his recall ability scoring nearly&lt;strong&gt; 87% lower&lt;/strong&gt; than his peers. MRI scans revealed &lt;strong&gt;shrinkage in the hippocampus&lt;/strong&gt;, a key brain region responsible for memory, while cerebrospinal fluid tests indicated the presence of &lt;strong&gt;biomarkers &lt;/strong&gt;linked to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What Makes This Case Unique?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before this case, the youngest confirmed Alzheimer’s patient was &lt;strong&gt;21 years old&lt;/strong&gt; and carried a mutation in the &lt;strong&gt;PSEN1 gene&lt;/strong&gt;, which leads to toxic protein buildup in the brain. This newly diagnosed teenager, however, &lt;strong&gt;had no detectable genetic abnormalities&lt;/strong&gt;, making his case even more mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that Alzheimer’s is &lt;strong&gt;not a one-size-fits-all disease&lt;/strong&gt;. While common in older adults, early-onset cases may develop &lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;hrough different, still unknown mechanisms. This case is forcing researchers to rethink their understanding of how and why Alzheimer’s begins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Future of Alzheimer’s Research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts say this unusual case raises critical scientific questions. If a previously healthy teenager can develop &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s without a genetic link&lt;/strong&gt;, are there other unknown environmental or biological factors at play?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neurologists at &lt;strong&gt;Capital Medical University in Beijing&lt;/strong&gt;, who published the case study in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad221065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, emphasized the need for more research on young patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;They believe studying&lt;strong&gt; early-onset cases &lt;/strong&gt;could unlock new insights into the fundamental causes of Alzheimer’s, potentially leading to earlier detection and better treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the words of the researchers, “Exploring the mysteries of young people with Alzheimer’s disease may become one of the most challenging scientific questions of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

            You’re standing in line at the supermarket or drugstore when a stranger speaks up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxno00023b5vmd7evow8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Hello, how are you?” the stranger greets you. “Good, and you?” might be your response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp00033b5vjnd0tfrv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Your conversation partner might proceed to talk to you about something trivial — the weather outside, the latest game, an annoyance during the morning commute or something silly the person’s dog did that morning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp00043b5vn7xwz4ca@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s nothing that matters much, but you’ve suddenly found yourself participating in small talk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp00053b5vjwkbbt6k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people might dread the seemingly insignificant conversation or think it’s not worth their time, while others may delight in the light exchange. In most cases, especially with strangers or acquaintances, small talk is unavoidable as both parties try to find common ground.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp00063b5v0rhmmbwa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s communication that we use to orient and acquaint ourselves with other people, (and) it’s the gateway to deeper, richer talk,” said Matt Abrahams, a lecturer in organizational behavior at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “Chances are, somebody in your friendship group, if not more, you met through a small talk situation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp00073b5ved3uthme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people without much practice in small talk, the challenge may feel daunting. But there are ways to get better at this form of communication. And it’s worthwhile to try, as the exchanges can positively affect a person’s overall well-being, Abrahams said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp00083b5vuw3hwelb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s what experts want people to know about the benefits of small talk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp00093b5vacby5q7h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People facing the prospect of small talk may put too much pressure on themselves to perform well when meeting someone for the first time. They also may worry about the daunting act of speaking spontaneously, which requires thinking on the spot and responding fast to keep the conversation going, said Abrahams, who hosts the podcast “&lt;a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/business-podcasts/think-fast-talk-smart-podcast" target="_blank"&gt;Think Fast, Talk Smart&lt;/a&gt;,” to share tips for strategic communication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            So why should you do it? Whether or not you seek out small talk or avoid it at all costs, research has shown that light conversations with people you don’t know well can have beneficial effects on health and well-being, such as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24769739/" target="_blank"&gt;boosting your mood&lt;/a&gt; and decreasing your &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-28833-001" target="_blank"&gt;feelings of isolation&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “(Small talk) is something that we psychologists think is kind of fundamental. It’s like (how) we need food, we need water — we need to feel like we belong and that we matter to other people,” said Dr. Gillian Sandstrom, an associate professor in the psychology of kindness at the UK’s University of Sussex who has researched the effects of minimal social interactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp000c3b5vd3tep3sv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then-US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy declared &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/18/health/loneliness-community-wellness/index.html"&gt;loneliness&lt;/a&gt; an epidemic in the United States in 2023. Daily loneliness affects 1 in 5 adults in the US, the highest &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651881/daily-loneliness-afflicts-one-five.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;level in two years&lt;/a&gt;, according to Gallup data from October.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            By having a light conversation with an acquaintance or stranger, people can feel more connected with one another and have a stronger sense of community, said Sandstrom, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/27/health/casual-relationships-older-adults-khn-wellness-partner/index.html"&gt;whose research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that those who have more casual daily interactions, such as talking to a neighbor or a barista at a coffee shop, feel a greater sense of belonging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp000e3b5vnpe0is02@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Talking to strangers can feel scary because we don’t know what’s going to happen, but also that’s kind of exciting,” Sandstrom said. “It’s fun and it’s nice to have some unexpected thing happen, where we learn something new or see a new perspective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In some scenarios, such as an upcoming work or networking event, people can prepare ahead of time for the expected spontaneous conversations, said &lt;a href="https://www.sunitasah.com/about-sunita" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Sunita Sah&lt;/a&gt;, an organizational psychologist and professor of management and organizations at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Researching people ahead of time who you know will be at an event and planning questions to ask can help to alleviate nerves, Sah said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp000g3b5vzrserbux@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In more spontaneous moments, there are tricks to making good conversation. The easiest method is to make an observation about your shared surroundings, which is why people often talk about the weather, or to ask people general questions to learn more about them, Sah said. (That’s why people often ask if you did anything interesting over the weekend or if you have any vacation plans.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp000h3b5vbpxjmtwj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This kind of conversation isn’t a tennis match, where one needs to get the ball back to the other side of the court as fast as possible. Abrahams said he likes to think of this exchange more as a game of hacky sack — in which the goal is to be collaborative to keep the sack in the air.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000i3b5v7ynoh70r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You have to coordinate with the other person, so I want to set you up, so then you can set me back up. It’s about being &lt;a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/dont-sweat-small-stuff-how-excel-small-talk-even-enjoy-it" target="_blank"&gt;interested, not interesting&lt;/a&gt;, and that mindset shift is important,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000j3b5vbvng9e6v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes slowing down and taking a beat before responding can reduce rambling and give more clarity and structure to an answer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000k3b5vq68l73wd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People will feel in small talk and other spontaneous speaking situations that they have to respond immediately, (but) you can say, ‘Give me a second to think about that.’ Or you can ask a clarifying question that gives yourself time to think,” Abrahams added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000l3b5viq18pc62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like anything, small talk gets better with practice, Sandstrom said. If someone goes a long time without socializing in casual settings, small talk might seem scarier than it is.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000m3b5vni5sj5py@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103122000750" target="_blank"&gt;In her research&lt;/a&gt;, Sandstrom found that the more people engage in small talk, the more confident they become in their social skills and the less worried they are about rejection, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000n3b5vd2kpr20l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the end of the day, small talk is meant to be lighthearted and enjoyable, and a little humor and compassion go a long way, Sah said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000o3b5vesg9rjjk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I personally really love small talk. I think it gives you lovely interactions with people throughout the day that you probably don’t want to go deeper with,” Sah said. “It really does build rapport and trust and some level of friendliness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000p3b5vd3ajrhny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In today’s age where everybody can just revert to their phones or go days without speaking to someone, I think that small talk (helps) take away the loneliness aspect.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Among those cancers, the spike in colorectal cancers has been especially sharp.

One reason is that cancer “feels like it’s something we can’t do anything about — once you get it, you die,” says Ropeik. “But that’s no longer anywhere near medically true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="md:hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto mb-5 flex flex-col overflow-hidden rounded-xl pb-5 shadow-[0_0_1px_rgba(200,160,251,.63),0_2px_6px_1px_#F3E6FE]"&gt;&lt;h3 class="m-auto block px-4 pb-4 pt-2 text-lg font-bold leading-6"&gt;Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="m-auto px-4 pb-4 text-sm font-normal"&gt;See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The fact that even experts don’t know exactly why colorectal cancer cases are rising among young people further spurs the feeling of uncertainty. And what theories scientists have to explain the phenomenon — such as rising rates of obesity and diets high in ultra-processed foods — only make people feel less in control. “People in their early 40s or 30s who used to have a lot of Cheez-Wiz or Top Ramen in college — those are refined and ultraprocessed, they can’t do anything about that now,” says Cassiday. For young adults looking back on their past choices and youthful indiscretions, it may feel like the damage that puts them at risk for colorectal cancer has already been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That concern can lead people to assume the worst, or seek out testing that may be unnecessary&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;“It’s a response you have, to try to play it safe rather than sorry,” says Cassiday. “We’re hardwired to feel whatever is scariest first,” to try to prepare for whatever horror our imaginations have cooked up, she adds. “But there’s no real way to be prepared for a horrible diagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And worry is only further fueled by stark, and not always well-contextualized warnings that colorectal cancer is on the rise. “The flashy or frightening headline is what gets attention,” says Cassiday. And when most of us see a statistic — like colorectal cancer rates doubling since the 1990s — we don’t necessarily realize that the figure applies to the population, not our personal risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most cancers can cause a wide array of subtle symptoms, many of which are experienced by healthy people too, says Cassiday. That’s especially true for symptoms of colorectal cancer, such as diarrhea, changes to stool color or consistency and stomach upset. &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:18;pos:1" class="link " href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4108-diarrhea" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Diarrhea;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:18;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/a&gt; affects everyone, with most adults experiencing at least one bout a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-to-combat-colorectal-cancer-phobia--and-what-not-to-do"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to combat colorectal cancer phobia — and what not to do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO: Put the numbers into perspective.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, the rate of colorectal cancer has risen dramatically among young adults. But it’s risen from an extremely small share of all cases to a small share of cases. In 2023, adults under 50 accounted for 13% of colorectal cancer cases and fewer than one in 10 deaths from colorectal cancer, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:19;pos:1" class="link " href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21772#:~:text=Estimated%20cases%20and%20deaths%20in,age%2C%202023%2C%20United%20States.&amp;amp;text=Note:%20Estimates%20are%20rounded%20to,and%20exclude%20in%20situ%20carcinoma.&amp;amp;text=Colon%20and%20rectal%20cancer%20deaths,the%20large%20rate%20of%20misclassification." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society’s (ACS) estimates;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:19;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;American Cancer Society’s (ACS) estimates&lt;/a&gt;. About 13 out of every 100,0000 young adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with the disease. That’s the equivalent of 13 people in all of Burbank, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T: Fall prey to ‘reassurance thinking.’ &lt;/strong&gt;In the throes of anxiety, it’s common for people to look for examples of others who feel like they do, online or among their friends, says Cassiday. It’s one of the “worst things you can do,” she says. “You’re granting yourself the right to practice medicine without a license.” Instead, seek reliable information from organizations like the ACS, the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or reputable health care providers. And ask yourself “the other what-ifs: What if I’m in great health?

But it can hurt, too, says Ropeik. For one, it gets expensive, especially because your insurance is unlikely to cover the tests or procedures if you’re under the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:20;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommended;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:20;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; age to start screening (45) and are otherwise at normal risk. Ropkeik warns that over-screening can also lead to even more anxiety-inducing false positives and even to injuries (there’s technically a &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:21;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2821994/#:~:text=Complications%20during%20colonoscopy,transfusion%20or%20additional%20invasive%20procedures." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:higher rate of colonoscopy complications;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:21;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;higher rate of colonoscopy complications&lt;/a&gt; than there is of colorectal cancer — though those too are more common among older people).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO: Watch for real signs. &lt;/strong&gt;All that said — if you &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;have new symptoms, such as diarrhea or blood in your stool, that don’t get better over time, you should see your health care provider.

A recent study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; explored how chewing different materials affects the brain and found that chewing on wood, compared to chewing gum, led to a significant increase in a brain antioxidant called glutathione.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that the act of chewing can influence brain activity and blood flow. This is important because the brain requires a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to function properly, and blood flow is the delivery system for these essential resources. Some studies have even shown that people with chewing difficulties tend to experience poorer cognitive abilities. However, exactly what metabolic changes occur in the brain when chewing improves blood flow has remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area of interest is oxidative stress in the brain. Oxidative stress is essentially damage to brain cells caused by harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species. This kind of damage is thought to play a significant role in the decline of brain function as we age. The brain is especially vulnerable to oxidative stress because it uses a lot of oxygen and contains fats that are easily damaged. To protect itself, the brain uses antioxidants, and one of the most important is glutathione.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glutathione acts like a bodyguard for brain cells, neutralizing harmful reactive oxygen species. Researchers in this study were curious if chewing, and specifically chewing materials of different hardness, could influence the levels of this protective antioxidant, glutathione, in the brain. They also wanted to see if any changes in glutathione were related to changes in thinking skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these questions, the researchers recruited 52 healthy university students in South Korea. They divided the students into two groups: one group would chew gum, and the other group would chew small wooden sticks, similar to popsicle sticks. The researchers made sure the groups were similar in age, gender, and education level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the chewing began, and again after five minutes of chewing, the researchers used a special brain scanning technique called Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to measure the levels of glutathione in a specific area of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex. This brain region is known to be important for cognitive control and thinking processes. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy is a non-invasive method that allows scientists to measure the concentration of different chemicals in the brain. The specific technique they used, called MEGA-PRESS, is particularly good at measuring glutathione.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the chewing task, participants were positioned comfortably and instructed to chew for five minutes. To keep the chewing consistent, they were asked to chew on the right side of their mouth at a rate of once per second, alternating between 30 seconds of chewing and 30 seconds of rest. One group chewed paraffin wax gum, which is a standard type of chewing gum used in research. The other group chewed on wooden tongue depressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both before and after the chewing session, all participants also completed a cognitive test called the Korean Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological State. This test is designed to quickly assess different aspects of thinking skills, including memory, attention, language, and visual-spatial abilities. This allowed the researchers to see if there was any change in cognitive function related to the chewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After analyzing the data, the researchers found some interesting results. First, they looked at the glutathione levels in the anterior cingulate cortex before and after chewing. In the group that chewed wood, they observed a significant increase in glutathione levels after chewing compared to before. This means that chewing wood seemed to boost the amount of this important antioxidant in that brain region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the gum-chewing group, there was no significant change in glutathione levels after chewing. While there wasn’t a statistically significant difference in the change in glutathione levels between the gum and wood groups directly, the trend was clearly towards a greater increase in the wood-chewing group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers examined the relationship between changes in glutathione levels and performance on the cognitive tests. They found that in the wood-chewing group, the increase in glutathione levels was positively related to scores on immediate memory and story memory tests. This means that participants who showed a larger increase in glutathione after chewing wood also tended to perform better on memory tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this relationship was not found in the gum-chewing group. There was no link between changes in glutathione and memory performance for those who chewed gum. In essence, chewing wood seemed to both increase brain antioxidant levels and improve certain aspects of memory, and these two changes appeared to be connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study, like all research, has some limitations to consider. Firstly, the participants were all young, healthy university students in their twenties. It’s not clear if these findings would be the same in older adults or in people with health conditions. Future studies should include a wider range of ages to see if the effects of chewing on glutathione and cognition are consistent across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the study focused on just one specific brain region, the anterior cingulate cortex. While this region is important for thinking, it would be beneficial to investigate other brain areas to get a more complete picture of how chewing affects the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the chewing period was relatively short, only five minutes. It’s possible that longer chewing durations, or different patterns of chewing, could have different effects. Also, while the study compared gum and wood, these materials differ in more ways than just hardness. Texture and other properties could also play a role. Future research could explore a wider variety of chewing materials and try to objectively measure the hardness of what people are chewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In summary, this study yielded two major findings. Firstly, the wood-chewing group experienced stimulated of brain [glutathione (GSH)] synthesis, leading to increased GSH levels in the brain,” the researchers concluded. “Secondly, correlation analysis indicated that the higher GSH levels in the wood-chewing group were associated with improved scores in cognitive measures. Since there are currently no drugs or established practices for boosting brain GSH levels, our findings suggest that chewing moderately hard material could serve as an effective practice for increasing GSH levels in the brain. Based on these results, consuming harder foods might prove more effective in enhancing brain antioxidant defenses through elevated GSH levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Effect of Chewing Hard Material on Boosting Brain Antioxidant Levels and Enhancing Cognitive Function&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Seungho Kim, Ji-Hye Kim, Hansol Lee, Sung Ho Jang, Ralph Noeske, Changho Choi, Yongmin Chang, and Youn-Hee Choi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 11:19:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNV2Y3Z29Gd3kxR3RiRzktVU5MT2hXUko4aE01OU5mWlVuQjZMbkdJanVCMEtRQjBVcjZlWkx0WFE5YTJQV0JzRnJzTmVCUzhyUXJxZVBIOVVYNDRlOUpaU2taSEM4X2VuNGpIazd3OEVndkxCZEFJZjdTSzRHaVdGSFJMUktsT2gteFdtSlpjVWE5RmM</guid></item><item><title>‘Short sighted’: What canceled FDA meetings and WHO withdrawal mean for fall flu vaccines - The Boston Globe</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNajhqMXBhOFowMlpRQ3NveE9sOFgtU1dZSzVpZEJaM2Ixd1IxSE4yYjVBR1lvcXdJNElnRUtjRnZvZW91LTl3UDYwaXVsOWJEcFFIUEZQOUVoTXBoeEFZQTI0UE9WcTdMOWpVTU1PYzF5SUVBc1VXNC0zYXdHRHd5djRqOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content

Panelists also perform a “post mortem” on the previous year’s flu season and how well scientists predicted which strains to target, Offit said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There’s vigorous debate and sometimes disagreement because that’s the way it should work,” he added. “This is a group of experts in the field who are independent of the government and independent of the pharmaceutical industry.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The committee meets early in the year because it usually &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/in-depth/flu-shots/art-20048000" target="_blank"&gt;takes about six months&lt;/a&gt; for pharmaceutical companies to produce the vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If you want a vaccine available for the fall, the strains included have to be decided by springtime,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, adding that the meeting’s cancellation is a “clear departure from prior practice.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee/charter-vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee" target="_blank"&gt;VRBPAC&lt;/a&gt; usually follows guidelines set out by the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/vaccines#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20(WHO,northern%20and%20southern%20hemispheres%2C%20respectively." target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization in February&lt;/a&gt; about which viruses to target. But on his first day in office, Trump signed an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; withdrawing the US from WHO. Offit said this is unlikely to impact the decisions the FDA makes about the flu vaccine. because experts from both organizations usually come to similar conclusions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s just disappointing to see that the tone is one of rejection of federal expertise regarding public health,” Offit said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Once the FDA decides which strains to target, manufacturers begin the process of including the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-process/index.html#:~:text=The%20most%20common,spray%20flu%20vaccine%22)." target="_blank"&gt;killed or weakened&lt;/a&gt; viruses in their vaccines, which are then formulated into standard doses for distribution. Doses are released in late summer, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fdas-critical-role-ensuring-safe-and-effective-flu-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;according to the FDA.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="why_are_these_meetings_important" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

Each year’s vaccine is designed to target specific surface proteins of flu viruses, which evolve as they infect more people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="how_could_this_impact_the_next_flu" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

The changes have sparked concern among the scientific community about how the government will handle vaccine policy in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/02/13/nation/robert-f-kennedy-jr-rfk-jr-confirmed-health-and-human-services/" target="_blank"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.‘s confirmation &lt;/a&gt;as secretary of Health and Human Services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The concerns are not so much that this particular cancellation will have a substantive impact on the availability of vaccines but that we don’t understand why this meeting was canceled,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. “We are seeing other actions being taken that are similarly unexplained that raise questions about the administration’s commitments to ensuring that Americans can get the vaccines they need to be protected from serious disease threats like influenza.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Offit said the&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-cancels-flu-vaccine-meeting/#:~:text=%22The%20FDA%20will%20make%20public%20its%20recommendations%20to%20manufacturers%20in%20time%20for%20updated%20vaccines%20to%20be%20available%20for%20the%202025%2D2026%20influenza%20season%2C%22%20the%20spokesperson%2C%20Andrew%20Nixon%2C%20said%20in%20a%20statement." target="_blank"&gt; FDA has promised &lt;/a&gt;to pick strains to target on its own and that there will be no delay in vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We should want to anticipate that there wouldn’t be any difference in the quality of the vaccines in terms of safety or efficacy, and I think that’s probably right,” he said. “But it’s a little concerning that the choice is to bring this all in-house and not have these decisions subject to an external advisory committee from which the public benefits.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Syra Madad, an infectious disease specialist at Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Chief Biopreparedness Officer at New York City’s hospital system, said the canceled FDA meeting appears to be another step toward the “dismantling of our public health infrastructure in this country.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She said infectious disease specialists need as much information as possible about what strains of influenza are circulating this season to best prepare for the next season, and scrapping expert input from the advisory committee may impede that insight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If we don’t have this information, then we may not have a really great flu vaccine  this upcoming flu season,” she said. “It may not even give pharmaceutical companies enough time to ramp up production, and we may start seeing spot shortages of flu vaccine next season.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. David Hamer, professor of global health and medicine at Boston University, said uncertainty about whether these meetings will be eliminated completely is concerning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Theoretically it could lead to a poor choice for the targets they put in a vaccine and therefore a potentially even worse influenza season next year,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In all, Hamer called the move “short-sighted.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Cancelling advisory meetings like this that are very important, especially for vaccine preventable diseases as well as other public health issues is not great,” he said. “It might save money today, but it may be a lot more expensive tomorrow in terms of the risk for a broader epidemic or pandemic.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kay Lazar of the Globe staff contributed reporting&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

			&lt;p&gt;In February 2025,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; rates spiked to the &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/u-s-facing-most-intense-flu-season-in-at-least-15-years"&gt;highest levels seen in at least 15 years&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flu-deaths-surpass-covid-for-first-time-since-pandemic-started/"&gt;flu outpacing COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since the beginning of the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has classified this &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/php/surveillance/in-season-severity.html"&gt;flu season as having "high" severity&lt;/a&gt; across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conversation asked &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pu3L9HkAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;epidemiologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/annette-regan"&gt;Annette Regan&lt;/a&gt; to explain why this flu season is different from last year's and what people can do to help reduce the spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do flu cases and hospitalizations this year compare with previous years?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in late January and extending through February 2025, flu hospitalizations &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-07.html"&gt;have been higher&lt;/a&gt; than any other week &lt;a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/FluHospRates.html"&gt;since before 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most flu cases appear to be from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; A strains, with a split between influenza A/H3N2 and influenza A/H1N1. These are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses-types.html"&gt;two different subtypes&lt;/a&gt; of the influenza A  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that historically seasons that are predominated by influenza A/H3N2 infections &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2023.06.024"&gt;tend to be more severe&lt;/a&gt;, but infections from influenza A/H1N1 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(23)00187-8"&gt;can still be very severe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's season is also peaking "late" compared with the past three flu seasons, which peaked in early or late December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there have been a number of deaths from flu too this season. Since Jan. 1, 2025, alone, over &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-06.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_6-mortality-surveillance"&gt;4,000 people, including 68 children, have died&lt;/a&gt; from flu. While the number of deaths do not mark a record number, it shows that flu can be a serious illness, even in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fH6v_uQYPs4?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Unless directed otherwise, everyone ages 6 months and older should get a flu shot.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why are flu cases so high this year?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of factors behind any severe season, including poor community protection from low immunization rates and low natural immunity, virus characteristics, vaccine effectiveness and increased human contact via travel, office work or schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, flu vaccination rates have declined since the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of the 2023-24 flu season, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/adult-vaccinations-administered.html"&gt;9.2 million fewer doses&lt;/a&gt; were administered in pharmacies and doctors' offices compared with an average year before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, since 2022, fewer and fewer doses of flu vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccine-doses-distributed.html"&gt;have been distributed&lt;/a&gt; by private manufacturers. Flu vaccination rates for adults have historically been in the 30% to 60% range, &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/increase-proportion-people-who-get-flu-vaccine-every-year-iid-09"&gt;much lower than the recommended 70%&lt;/a&gt;. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, flu vaccination rates were increasing by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/adultvaxview/publications-resources/vaccination-coverage-adults-2019-2020.html"&gt;around 1% to 2% every year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu vaccination rates began dropping after the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in higher-risk groups. Flu vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/children-vaccination-coverage.html"&gt;in children has dropped&lt;/a&gt; from 59% in 2019-20 to 46% in 2024-25. In adults 65 years and older, the group with the greatest risk of hospitalization and death, flu vaccination rates dropped &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/adults-65-years-and-older.html"&gt;from 52% in 2019-20 to 43% in 2024-25&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower vaccination rates mean a greater portion of the population is not protected by vaccines. Data shows that vaccination &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2017.1321722"&gt;reduces the risk of flu hospitalization&lt;/a&gt;. Even if a vaccinated person gets infected, they may be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00493-5"&gt;less likely to experience severe illness&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, low vaccination rates could contribute to higher flu severity this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, low vaccination rates are probably not the only reason for the high rates of flu this season. In previous severe seasons, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(24)00067-3"&gt;genetic changes to the viruses&lt;/a&gt; have made them better at infecting people and more likely to cause severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of annual flu vaccines varies depending on how well the vaccine matches the circulating virus. The effectiveness of vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/2023-2024.html"&gt;ranges from 19% to 60%&lt;/a&gt; in any given season. In the 2023-24 flu season, the vaccine was 42% effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, early 2024-25 data from the U.S. shows that the vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_e&amp;amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM145368&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=This%20Week%20in%20MMWR%3A%20Vol.%2074%2C%20February%2027%2C%202025&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM145368"&gt;41% to 55% effective&lt;/a&gt; against flu hospitalizations in adults and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_e&amp;amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM145368&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=This%20Week%20in%20MMWR%3A%20Vol.%2074%2C%20February%2027%2C%202025&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM145368"&gt;63% to 78% effective&lt;/a&gt; against flu hospitalizations in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8DhgzpELrPI?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Something as simple as regular handwashing could keep you from getting the flu.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do seasonal flu symptoms differ from COVID-19 and other illnesses?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to remember that people often incorrectly refer to "the flu" when they have a common cold. Flu is caused only by the influenza virus, which tends to be &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/coldflu.html"&gt;more severe than common colds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/cold-or-flu"&gt;more commonly causes a fever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the signs and symptoms for flu, COVID-19 and other respiratory  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/flu-vs-covid19.html"&gt;are the same&lt;/a&gt; and can range from mild coldlike symptoms to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pneumonia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73057" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and respiratory distress. Common flu symptoms are  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, cough and fatigue, and may also include shortness of breath, a sore throat, nasal congestion, muscle aches and headache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some symptoms, such as changes in or loss of taste and smell, are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9061753"&gt;more common for COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. For both COVID-19 and flu, the symptoms do not start until about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/flu-vs-covid19.html"&gt;one to four days after infection&lt;/a&gt;, and symptoms seem to last longer for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to know what virus is causing an infection is to test. This can be done using a rapid test, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests"&gt;some of which now test for flu and COVID-19 together&lt;/a&gt;, or by seeing a doctor and getting tested using a nasal swab. There are prescription antiviral medications available to treat flu and COVID-19, but they need to be taken near the time that symptoms start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm"&gt;high risk of severe flu&lt;/a&gt; and COVID-19, such as those who are immunosuppressed, have  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or have chronic heart or lung conditions. In these cases, it is important to seek early care and treatment from a health care professional. Some doctors will also prescribe via telehealth calls, which can help reduce the strain on doctors' offices, urgent care centers and emergency rooms when infection rates are high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What can people do now to help steer clear of the flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways people can reduce their risk of getting or spreading flu. Since the flu season is still underway, it's not too late to get a flu vaccine. Even in seasons when the vaccine's effectiveness is low, it is likely to offer better protection compared with remaining unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/about/index.html"&gt;Handwashing&lt;/a&gt; and disinfecting high-traffic surfaces can help reduce contact with the flu virus. Taking efforts to avoid contact with sick people can also help, including wearing a mask when in health care facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, remember to take care of yourself. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevention/actions-prevent-flu.html"&gt;Exercising, eating healthy and getting sufficient sleep&lt;/a&gt; all help support a healthy immune system, which can help reduce chances of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have been diagnosed with flu or are experiencing flu-like symptoms should avoid contact with other people, especially in crowded spaces. Covering coughs and sneezes can help reduce the amount of virus that is spread.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/250252/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Government statistics show that as of December 2024, the sickness had infected over 20,414 people and killed 347 of them. States like Delhi, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Rajasthan have been especially impacted by the spike in cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em " data-ua-type="1"&gt;It's important that we understand what swine flu is, why cases are increasing, and how to protect ourselves because doctors are observing a rise in individuals showing flu-like symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Swine Flu (H1N1)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swine flu, also referred to as influenza A (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513241/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;H1N1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;), is a respiratory infection caused by the H1N1 virus. Originally isolated in pigs, this virus evolved and began infecting humans, resulting in massive outbreaks. Swine flu symptoms are similar to seasonal flu, including fever, cough, sore throat, body pains, chills, and tiredness. In severe situations, it can cause pneumonia and other respiratory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Currently, the most common viruses in circulation are Influenza A (H1N1) and its subtype H3N2. Several factors contribute to the increase of cases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seasonal pattern: The monsoon and winter months create helpful circumstances for the virus to grow and spread.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased travel and gatherings: Following the epidemic, social interactions and travel have increased, making the virus more easily transmitted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many people have weakened immunity as a result of changing weather, COVID-19 problems, and stress-related health difficulties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delayed vaccination: Many people are vulnerable because they are unaware of and unable to obtain flu shots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does Swine Flu spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swine flu spreads similarly to regular flu viruses. The primary modes of transmission include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Person-to-person contact: Respiratory droplets from an infected person's cough, sneeze, or speech can transmit the virus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Touching infected surfaces: The virus can live for hours on surfaces such as handrails, tables, and doorknobs, raising the chance of infection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Close contact with sick people: The danger of contracting the virus is greatly increased when you spend time with someone who displays flu-like symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent Swine Flu?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no foolproof way to avoid swine flu, following these &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/swine-flu/prevention/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;preventive measures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; can significantly reduce the risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frequent handwashing: Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can also be effective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear a mask: Especially in crowded places, wearing a mask helps prevent inhaling infected droplets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boost immunity: Eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and get adequate sleep to strengthen the immune system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid close contact with infected individuals: If someone around you is showing flu-like symptoms, maintain a safe distance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get vaccinated: The flu vaccine provides protection against influenza viruses, including H1N1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disinfect surfaces: Regularly clean frequently touched surfaces to prevent viral contamination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice respiratory hygiene: Always cover your mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing and dispose of tissues properly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Are there medications for Swine Flu?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1352045/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;antiviral medications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are recommended for treating swine flu.

Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-the-study-found"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the study found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Using data on nearly half a million people from the U.K., Oxford University researchers looked for patterns in who died prematurely, or before the age of 75. They also looked at markers of biological aging in a smaller subset of the study group (over 45,000 people). Their analysis included comparisons of genetic risk factors for disease as well as what some scientists have termed the “exposome.” Our DNA makes up our genome, whereas the exposome is made up of all the exposures we encounter throughout life. This includes everything from what we eat, drink and inhale to the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/green-spaces-walking-paths-little-traffic-7-features-of-a-healthy-neighborhood-090012442.html" data-ylk="slk:neighborhoods we live in;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;neighborhoods we live in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="md:hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto mb-5 flex flex-col overflow-hidden rounded-xl pb-5 shadow-[0_0_1px_rgba(200,160,251,.63),0_2px_6px_1px_#F3E6FE]"&gt;&lt;h3 class="m-auto block px-4 pb-4 pt-2 text-lg font-bold leading-6"&gt;Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="m-auto px-4 pb-4 text-sm font-normal"&gt;See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While genetics accounted for less than 2% of the difference in people’s risks of death, environmental factors were behind 17% of the disparity, the scientists found. Smoking, socioeconomic status — a measure of factors like income, neighborhood, education and occupation — physical activity levels and living conditions had the greatest influence on someone’s biological aging and risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of these factors — such as how much money you make or whether you can afford to own a home in a nice neighborhood — are hard to change. But overall, 23 out of 25 of the environmental variables the researchers looked at are modifiable. And many of them are pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="do-genes-not-matter-when-it-comes-to-longevity"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do genes not matter when it comes to longevity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No, they definitely do. But to what extent varies a lot depending on the specific genes, the diseases that they put you at risk for and what you do throughout your life.

But, aside from a person’s age, smoking has a greater bearing on longevity and aging than any other factor — genetic or environmental — according to the new study. Second to age, the factor that most influenced mortality risk was “smoking pack years,” meaning the number of packs of cigarettes a person smoked daily, for how many years. And smoking status — whether someone currently, formerly or never smoked — was the fourth-most-influential factor (sex was third; men are more likely to die earlier than women). “If you can do one thing, don’t smoke,” says Argentieri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="2-get-good-sleep"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.

That’s in part because many of the chronic conditions that accelerate aging and lead to early death are cardiometabolic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and stroke. Obesity increases risks for these conditions, while exercise, in combination with a healthy diet, can reduce those risks.

Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-the-study-found"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the study found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Using data on nearly half a million people from the U.K., Oxford University researchers looked for patterns in who died prematurely, or before the age of 75. They also looked at markers of biological aging in a smaller subset of the study group (over 45,000 people). Their analysis included comparisons of genetic risk factors for disease as well as what some scientists have termed the “exposome.” Our DNA makes up our genome, whereas the exposome is made up of all the exposures we encounter throughout life. This includes everything from what we eat, drink and inhale to the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/green-spaces-walking-paths-little-traffic-7-features-of-a-healthy-neighborhood-090012442.html" data-ylk="slk:neighborhoods we live in;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;neighborhoods we live in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="md:hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto mb-5 flex flex-col overflow-hidden rounded-xl pb-5 shadow-[0_0_1px_rgba(200,160,251,.63),0_2px_6px_1px_#F3E6FE]"&gt;&lt;h3 class="m-auto block px-4 pb-4 pt-2 text-lg font-bold leading-6"&gt;Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="m-auto px-4 pb-4 text-sm font-normal"&gt;See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While genetics accounted for less than 2% of the difference in people’s risks of death, environmental factors were behind 17% of the disparity, the scientists found. Smoking, socioeconomic status — a measure of factors like income, neighborhood, education and occupation — physical activity levels and living conditions had the greatest influence on someone’s biological aging and risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of these factors — such as how much money you make or whether you can afford to own a home in a nice neighborhood — are hard to change. But overall, 23 out of 25 of the environmental variables the researchers looked at are modifiable. And many of them are pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="do-genes-not-matter-when-it-comes-to-longevity"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do genes not matter when it comes to longevity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No, they definitely do.

Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="what-the-study-found"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the study found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data on nearly half a million people from the U.K., Oxford University researchers looked for patterns in who died prematurely, or before the age of 75. They also looked at markers of biological aging in a smaller subset of the study group (over 45,000 people). Their analysis included comparisons of genetic risk factors for disease as well as what some scientists have termed the “exposome.” Our DNA makes up our genome, whereas the exposome is made up of all the exposures we encounter throughout life. This includes everything from what we eat, drink and inhale to the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/green-spaces-walking-paths-little-traffic-7-features-of-a-healthy-neighborhood-090012442.html" data-ylk="slk:neighborhoods we live in;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;neighborhoods we live in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While genetics accounted for less than 2% of the difference in people’s risks of death, environmental factors were behind 17% of the disparity, the scientists found. Smoking, socioeconomic status — a measure of factors like income, neighborhood, education and occupation — physical activity levels and living conditions had the greatest influence on someone’s biological aging and risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these factors — such as how much money you make or whether you can afford to own a home in a nice neighborhood — are hard to change. But overall, 23 out of 25 of the environmental variables the researchers looked at are modifiable. And many of them are pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="do-genes-not-matter-when-it-comes-to-longevity"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do genes not matter when it comes to longevity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, they definitely do. But to what extent varies a lot depending on the specific genes, the diseases that they put you at risk for and what you do throughout your life. For example, which variants of the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/genes-known-increase-risk-alzheimer-151136656.html" data-ylk="slk:APOE gene;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;APOE gene&lt;/a&gt; you carry is highly predictive of your risk for Alzheimer’s disease; the same goes for &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/jenna-wolfe-hysterectomy-brca-gene-232125745.html" data-ylk="slk:BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants and breast cancer;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants and breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. And these diseases can have a lot to do with your biological aging and life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even these genes are influenced by your behavior and environment. And, in most cases, our choices and the lives we lead have a huge impact on what those genes will mean for our health. “Someone put a comment on our paper, saying ‘genetics loads the dice, but it’s up to us to play our hand,’” &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/people/austin-argentieri-phd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Austin Argentieri,;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Austin Argentieri,&lt;/a&gt; a research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital who led the new study while he was a researcher at Oxford Population Health, tells Yahoo Life. Even if your genetic makeup predisposes you to diseases that could cut your life short, “in most cases, you can mitigate that risk through lifestyle, behavior, or taking different drugs or treatments,” explains Argentieri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="changes-that-can-set-you-up-for-a-longer-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes that can set you up for a longer life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="1-dont-smoke"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Don’t smoke.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now, it’s hardly a surprise that &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/smoking-rates-declining-too-lung-120036320.html" data-ylk="slk:smoking;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;smoking &lt;/a&gt;is bad for you. But, aside from a person’s age, smoking has a greater bearing on longevity and aging than any other factor — genetic or environmental — according to the new study. Second to age, the factor that most influenced mortality risk was “smoking pack years,” meaning the number of packs of cigarettes a person smoked daily, for how many years. And smoking status — whether someone currently, formerly or never smoked — was the fourth-most-influential factor (sex was third; men are more likely to die earlier than women). “If you can do one thing, don’t smoke,” says Argentieri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="2-get-good-sleep"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Get good sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are tired frequently or don’t get very much sleep at night are more likely to both age quickly and die prematurely. &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/how-much-sleep-do-i-need-201727574.html" data-ylk="slk:How much sleep you need;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;How much sleep you need&lt;/a&gt; varies from person to person, but for most adults, you should aim to get seven to nine hours a night. And try to have good “&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/sleep-hygiene-140453735.html" data-ylk="slk:sleep hygiene;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt;” by going to bed and waking at consistent times, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/babies-have-sleep-routines-heres-why-adults-should-too-205345568.html" data-ylk="slk:having a bedtime routine;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;having a bedtime routine&lt;/a&gt;, keeping your room dark and keeping your phone away from your bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="3-get-moving"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Get moving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After tiredness, physical activity “is close in the running for the top” factor influencing biological aging and risk of death, says Argentieri. That’s in part because many of the chronic conditions that accelerate aging and lead to early death are cardiometabolic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and stroke. Obesity increases risks for these conditions, while exercise, in combination with a healthy diet, can reduce those risks. Diet may have more influence, but “that doesn’t mean that exercise shouldn’t be part of the plan,” &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://gero.usc.edu/faculty/longo/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Valter Longo;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Valter Longo&lt;/a&gt;, a University of Southern California professor of gerontology who studies how nutrition and fasting can influence longevity, tells Yahoo Life. &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link" data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/want-to-live-a-longer-healthier-life-new-research-sheds-light-on-the-lifestyle-factors-that-matter-150908451.html" data-ylk="slk:In combination with other habits, exercising;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;In combination with other habits, exercising&lt;/a&gt; can help you live healthier, for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="4-eat-for-longer-living"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.

While some &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6853289/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that it is marginal, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360132306000242" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; from Finland suggests that it might be more significant. Take the office environment, for example. While it's unlikely that there's a temperature which pleases everyone due to our individual thermoregulation, overall the study found that women were often dissatisfied with the room temperature, feeling both uncomfortably colder and hotter than men. Another study of office temperatures in Japan showed a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378778802000129" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;3.1C (37F) difference in neutral temperature&lt;/a&gt; between female and male workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the home, meanwhile, reaching an optimal core body temperature may not be a "golden ticket" to a perfect sleep, says Bill Wisden, a sleep expert and director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at Imperial College London, "but it would help".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Sleep, he says, is "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031938406003933" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;temporally related&lt;/a&gt; to the circadian rhythm of core body temperature and skin temperature". In other words, a couple of hours before we go to sleep, our core body temperature begins to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468867319301804" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;decrease&lt;/a&gt; when melatonin, the hormone that regulates the sleep cycle, is produced. Body temperature continues to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/best-temperature-for-sleep" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; throughout the night reaching a low point in the early morning before gradually warming up as the morning progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Elderly people are more vulnerable to temperature changes as they are less able to thermoregulate (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Elderly people are more vulnerable to temperature changes as they are less able to thermoregulate (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One thing that can help you fall asleep is the "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079218301552?via=ihub" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;hot bath effect&lt;/a&gt;". Wisden says that having a hot bath before bedtime can help induce sleep. "We've done physiological experiments with mice and found that if you warm the skin, that sends signals to the hypothalamus in the base of the brain – and that triggers an induction of sleep and a cooling of the body." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So, getting under a thick duvet at night can help the body prepare the body for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468867319301804" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;longer episodes of sleep or deeper sleep.&lt;/a&gt; Snuggling up like this – to warm the skin – is not unique to humans. Wisden adds: "Pets, cats and dogs curl up – and some animals build a nest… that provides a kind of thermal insulation." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But once you're fast asleep, a cool room temperature is ideal: between 16-18C (60-65F). While &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37474050/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;older adults might sleep more comfortably&lt;/a&gt; in a room that's a couple of degrees warmer, being in a room that's too warm can cause &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001393511500033X?via=ihub" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;poor sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to waking up throughout the night, as well as a lack of non-REM sleep – the most &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;restful&lt;/a&gt; stage of sleep. "Being too hot during sleep is bad. It's exactly like a noise, or a sensation on your skin, or a pain. Being hot while you're asleep stimulates sensory perception and wakes you up," Wisden says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ultimately, while we can be guided by research, it seems it may be impossible to find an optimal temperature that will please everyone.

About 40,000 people die of flu per year. About 50,000 a year die of COVID-19, which is still a serious threat to many, although no longer the pandemic emergency declared five years ago when it emerged as a novel virus for which no one had immunity or vaccine protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“No one thinks about 40,000 people dying of flu or COVID — it just becomes normal. You have to put a face to it, in a way that makes it real,” Halkitis said. “We have to make it more of a human-based story about the 100,000 we’re going to lose this year from flu and COVID because we’ve not been good about our vaccinations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Philadelphia Inquirer</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNTFJiX3pRRzdyNUFXMG42d21vZ0UtUGhXd0g1eEpOYnFtYVdsZFJWRER2bEMxR2JLTzMyalNaUDlySlVVcU10R3RjOFY3ZlBwNURobkNTNWhHSkJ1QXhidXhSRldKaU5UTFluQVlSTzNPUEdIMFFPQmlVQ2hhZ0FlcC1pS3BseUJHTjZaTFotTHFXZw</guid></item><item><title>Want Healthier Eyes? 6 Vitamins and Supplements to Give You a Boost - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxNOW9kZE16Zk5VUThRdkdLbkhDRy1RUGxna2ptUUp6ekw3eXVqNnRlQ0NiV2dHeWR6Z0ZLUEgwY3pidkJZSDFGUmR0Vy1HUTJ0U1d2LU5kT09mSVMtcGpEZFVyYzU3M18zLWhwOVpmYkVSanE4LURmbXNXYXVwbFF0Y0w1SVozMDl2WDJvZA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;A balanced diet isn't just crucial for your overall health and wellness -- it can also benefit specific parts of your body, giving them a boost.

Dementia UK, a leading charity, notes that FTD, which affects about 5% of all dementia patients, initially bypasses the more recognized symptoms like memory loss and instead may first show up as obsessive or repetitive behaviors, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/164821/vitamin-b12-dementia-risk-lower"&gt;particularly in one's diet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports from as.com highlight that according to research from the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA), individuals with FTD might exhibit a range of unusual eating patterns, such as binge eating, fixations on specific foods, or even ingesting inedible items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sciencedaily echoes this, pointing out the complex challenges posed by the abnormal eating behaviors associated with FTD. In some cases, patients become so fixated on certain foods that they reject anything else; for instance, there was a woman who only ate bananas and milk for months, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/entertainment/celebrity-news/128794/wendy-williams-has-frontotemporal-dementia-what-ftd"&gt;later confirmed to have had FTD through an autopsy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instances of FTD patients snatching food off others' plates or ignoring their dietary needs are not uncommon. "These behaviours can be problematic both physically and socially," comments Marilena Aiello, a SISSA researcher who contributed to a review on the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research unearthed striking data: "Several findings reveal that such eating alterations are more common in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) than other types of dementia. Moreover, eating alterations may differ between the two variants of the disease, namely the behavioral variant and semantic dementia (SD)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She offered details: "Patients tend to gain weight. Although in some extreme cases they lose weight due to obsessive consumption of a single food."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study sheds light on how frontotemporal dementia affects dietary habits, the precise mechanisms remain uncertain. Aiello has suggested that disruptions in the autonomic nervous system could be instrumental, particularly by affecting the perception of hunger, satiety, and overall appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, harm to the hypothalamus might remove inhibitory controls, prompting uninhibited eating behaviors. The hypothalamus plays a pivotal role in the creation of hormones that govern heart rate, body temperature, as well as the sensation of hunger, and the sleep-wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, sensory and cognitive challenges, for instance, struggles with recognizing what is edible, could also have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the symptoms of FTD?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altered eating patterns might indicate frontotemporal dementia; however, there are additional tell-tale symptoms to consider. Per NHS England, the chief indicators of FTD usually revolve around changes in character and conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes impulsive or inappropriate actions, a lack of empathy, neglect of personal hygiene and loss of motivation. Language difficulties may also arise, including slow speech or trouble using words correctly or in the proper order within a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People may also struggle with organising and planning tasks and are easily distracted. As mentioned, although memory loss is not one of the initial symptoms, it often appears in more advanced stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 08:23:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOdEdPMFVReVBuOWxtejgwM0djRUhXaUFERGpiSmo2YWx3MThPVDVuZURGWUNxVHl5YWlVcm1zRk4xWTRmUXNfQ1hmMFhfS3ZlUUZiZXl1d1N6dFdwNVZoNVRMQXhmZ0FCOExETnU3cHMyQVN3Vk9jQVBfQlBSQkIxenBLVjlxTmN5V3BzeTZtczFMaE5jTUxDV3I0U1ZtdDhHSzRTbnZ1WQ</guid></item><item><title>I tried walking yoga and I was amazed by how calm it made me feel - Fit and Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNNzFvQmJ3LWRUejRsUHBPa0gyX3h4Rk1xRkJlVkJFQmZBZ3I5WHhwdDZPV0RCeWcxVTNKaVhYX0MzbDJ5QWN3Nk1fNzBDbGdzNGxON3dfQkRMZjNtZU9ZSXFsc3hJVG56LWdsdTNNQWw0WFVGMFJZR09vSHJmdUQwR3BPVEh3N2xPRnViSFZrTTQyR3pTLTdRTmlXTDkxMDZQVzA0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of walking and I do my best to hit 7,500 steps every day. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-is-mindful-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-is-mindful-walking"&gt;Mindful walking&lt;/a&gt; is nothing new to me, but I had never heard of walking yoga until Sophia Drozd, a yoga instructor and creator of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" data-url="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Yoga for Pain &lt;/a&gt;app, brought it to my attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drozd explained that it was first established in the 1970s as a way of combining yoga and breathwork with an everyday activity: walking. I decided to give it a go, forgoing my usual headphones and music for some focus and breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do it, all I had to do was synchronize my steps with my breath and be mindful of my body and surroundings while I walked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-i-found"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What I found: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You have to concentrate&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This may seem obvious to anyone who has ever tried to pat their head and rub their tummy at the same time, but I was surprised at how much focus was required for me to synchronize my breathing with my steps. Because I was concentrating, my mind didn’t wander and I didn’t spend time analyzing my day — a habit that can make me feel stressed or anxious even in lovely weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Mindfulness came naturally &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once my breath and steps were synchronized, I grew aware of my surroundings and how I felt in my body. I was amazed at how the breathwork made me feel, cutting through the noise in my head and reconnecting me with myself. The rhythmic, repetitive nature of syncing my breath and steps felt calming—almost hypnotic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. I was more aware of the beauty around me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the distraction of my headphones or thoughts, I noticed the beauty of the natural world. I chose a fantastic day to try walking yoga: the sun was shining, the birds were chirping and I could smell spring in the air. When I got back and thought about it, I realized that the weather had been the same the day before. I just hadn’t noticed because I had been so wrapped up in my thoughts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. It slowed down my walking pace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Ys5bdHaDp675H8urbx4zAk" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Ys5bdHaDp675H8urbx4zAk slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I timed my inhale and exhale to coincide with my left foot striking the ground, so I was taking two steps per breath. This was only sustainable if I slowed my walking pace down. I tried other breathing patterns but nothing else worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-start-walking-yoga"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to start walking yoga&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Start small," advises Drozd, "Especially if you're not a daily yogi or walker." She encourages starting with five minutes a day in a place you know well—your session could even form part of a larger walk. You can then gradually increase by five minutes every few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will give you time for your muscles to adjust to your new routine," she says. "Keep increasing until you get to 20 minutes a day. If you can't spare 20 minutes every day or want to mix walking yoga sessions into your weekly routine, I would recommend doing 30 minutes, three days a week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular mindful practice for your mind and body can help reduce stress, boost your mood, and improve concentration and body awareness, says Drozd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-person-Ys5bdHaDp675H8urbx4zAk-MyDJbt1rjt5tjKEvYfiK703BiJyE5fIC" class="slice-container person-wrapper person-Ys5bdHaDp675H8urbx4zAk-MyDJbt1rjt5tjKEvYfiK703BiJyE5fIC slice-container-person"&gt;&lt;div class="person person--separator person--strapline"&gt;&lt;span class="person__strapline"&gt;About our expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="person__heading"&gt;&lt;span class="person__strapline-inline"&gt;About our expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="person__name-socials"&gt;&lt;span class="person__name"&gt;Sophia Drozd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nav class="button-social-group person__social-buttons" aria-labelledby="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;&lt;p id="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;Social Links Navigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="button-social   " href="https://www.instagram.com/yogaforpainapp/%20" target="_blank" aria-label="INSTAGRAM"&gt;&lt;span class="button-social__icon"&gt;&lt;svg class="icon_instagram" viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;circle cx="12" cy="12" fill="#de3073" r="12"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;path d="M18.958 9.116a5.121 5.121 0 00-.336-1.708 3.557 3.557 0 00-2.044-2.044 5.12 5.12 0 00-1.694-.322C14.142 5.014 13.89 5 12 5s-2.142.014-2.884.042a5.213 5.213 0 00-1.708.322 3.665 3.665 0 00-2.044 2.044 5.213 5.213 0 00-.322 1.708C5.014 9.858 5 10.1 5 12s.014 2.142.042 2.884a5.12 5.12 0 00.322 1.694 3.44 3.44 0 00.812 1.246 3.4 3.4 0 001.232.8 5.175 5.175 0 001.708.336c.742.028.98.042 2.884.042s2.142-.014 2.884-.042a5.082 5.082 0 001.694-.336 3.456 3.456 0 002.044-2.044 5.006 5.006 0 00.336-1.694C18.986 14.142 19 13.9 19 12s-.014-2.142-.042-2.884zM17.7 14.828a3.946 3.946 0 01-.252 1.3 2.189 2.189 0 01-.518.8 2.165 2.165 0 01-.8.532 4.641 4.641 0 01-1.3.238c-.742.028-.966.042-2.828.042s-2.1-.014-2.828-.042a3.837 3.837 0 01-1.3-.252A2.258 2.258 0 016.54 16.13a3.91 3.91 0 01-.238-1.3c-.028-.742-.042-.966-.042-2.828s.014-2.086.042-2.828a3.787 3.787 0 01.238-1.3A2.445 2.445 0 017.87 6.54a3.856 3.856 0 011.3-.238c.742-.028.952-.042 2.828-.042s2.086.014 2.828.042a3.787 3.787 0 011.3.238 2.445 2.445 0 011.33 1.33 4.641 4.641 0 01.238 1.3c.027.742.042.952.042 2.828s-.011 2.088-.036 2.83zM12 8.4a3.6 3.6 0 103.6 3.6A3.6 3.6 0 0012 8.4zm.181 5.929a2.338 2.338 0 01-.362-4.662 2.43 2.43 0 01.362 0 2.338 2.338 0 010 4.662zm3.557-6.909a.84.84 0 11-.84.84.84.84 0 01.84-.838z" fill="#fff"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="button-social   " href="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="WEBSITE"&gt;&lt;span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"&gt;&lt;svg class="icon-website" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 1000 1000"&gt;&lt;path d="M1000 500A501 501 0 0 0 503 0h-6A501 501 0 0 0 0 500c0 275 223 499 498 500h4a501 501 0 0 0 498-500zM529 936V765h133c-31 90-79 154-133 171zM337 765h134v171c-54-17-101-81-134-171zM61 539h176a899 899 0 0 0 22 167H110a439 439 0 0 1-49-166zM471 64v191H331c31-101 82-173 140-191zm199 191H529V64c58 18 109 90 140 191zm270 226H763c-1-59-7-115-18-167h155a438 438 0 0 1 40 167zm-235 0H529V314h156a857 857 0 0 1 19 167zM471 314v167H296a859 859 0 0 1 19-167h156zM237 481H60a438 438 0 0 1 41-167h154a921 921 0 0 0-18 167zm59 58h175v167H320a837 837 0 0 1-24-166zm233 167V539h175a831 831 0 0 1-24 167H529zm234-166h176a436 436 0 0 1-49 166H741a893 893 0 0 0 22-166zm104-285H731c-20-68-47-126-81-169a443 443 0 0 1 217 169zM350 86c-33 43-61 101-81 169H133A443 443 0 0 1 350 86zM148 765h127c20 59 45 110 75 150a442 442 0 0 1-202-150zm502 150c30-39 56-91 75-150h127a442 442 0 0 1-202 150z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="person__bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophia Drozd is the owner and founder of &lt;a href="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Yoga for Pain&lt;/a&gt;  (Y4P), and is a qualified yoga teacher, lifelong practitioner and chronic pain warrior.

sees tired parents giving their little ones a spoonful of butter before putting them down for the night - with some claiming it helps their tots sleep all the way through until morning.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, despite being hailed by some as a genius parenting hack, experts have warned it's not likely to actually make a difference - and can do more harm than good in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trend, which first took hold in the US, saw mothers giving their babies a small square or spoonful of butter, often the Irish Kerrygold, before claiming they had managed to enjoy a full eight hours of sleep as their toddler slept through the night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now the trend has spread to the UK and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_zealand/index.html" id="mol-f4d68940-eed5-11ef-8723-ad50ed56589d"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; with parents desperate for some shut-eye trying it on their own children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One mother has posted several clips on her social media account which show her trying the trend on her tot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Millie (@millieellis) has been documenting her attempts to settle her baby with the technique with her followers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one video she told people: 'So we are going to try the butter trend where you give your baby a spoonful of butter and apparently it works magic and they sleep all night long.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Parents have been feeding their babies butter just before bed in a bid to get their children to sleep through the night, hopping on a viral TikTok trend&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She then filmed herself giving a little spoon of Lurpak to her daughter Ivy, who at first was hesitant but soon swallowed the whole spoonful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After her mouthful of butter, Ivy slept soundly all evening, her mother claims. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Millie has followed up on her first video and posted other people documenting her trying this new trend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Evaluating the use of butter to send daughter Ivy off to sleep, Millie said she experienced longer between waking up periods but added she wasn't sure if that was the butter or because Ivy was overtired that day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paige Balloch (@baigepalloch), a mother from New Zealand, also tried the trend explaining that her 15-month-old had never slept through the night and she was willing to try anything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to the camera she said: 'We're trying the butter before bed to see if it helps her sleep longer, because what do I have to lose?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exhausted mother then called over her toddler and fed her a spoonful of butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in a follow-up video, Paige revealed it hadn't worked for her little Margot who woke up three times in the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One mother Millie has posted several videos on her social media account following her trying this trend on her daughter Ivy with mixed success&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the trick takes hold around the world, experts have warned that the viral trick is fruitless and won't help babies sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hannah Love, a nutritional therapist and TikToker, took to the social media platform to debunk the trend, telling her followers it was a waste of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I know the nutritional benefits of fats and they can slow down digestion, they're going to regulate blood sugar levels, they're going to regulate hormones, they can even reduce inflammation so there's lots of things that fats are very beneficial for to help with sleep which is probably where this has come from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But is butter the best thing for this? No, absolutely not. There are so many more beneficial fats that you could use to benefit your baby's diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Charlotte Stirling-Reed, a leading baby nutritionist, told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sleep-butter-tiktok-trend-social-media-b2698194.html"&gt;Independent &lt;/a&gt;that that social media platforms are 'rife with misinformation' and that butter is not recommended to help babies sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that in fact it can present a danger because the texture of the butter could pose a chocking hazard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Incorporating butter into cooking or spreading a thin layer on toast is perfectly fine. However, offering large chunks of butter directly from a spoon is not advisable.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS advises that it is perfectly normal for babies to wake up in the night, telling parents: 'Newborn babies invariably wake up repeatedly in the night for the first few months, and disturbed nights can be very hard to cope with.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Paige Balloch, a New Zealand mum also tired the trend, explaining that her 15-month-old had never slept through the night and she was willing to try anything&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;But experts have warned that the viral trick is a pointless task and won't help babies sleep and could even pose a danger to babies' health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To counteract this, it recommends starting a night time routine which can include having a bath, changing into night clothes reading a bedtime story or singing a lullaby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also reassured parents that different babies have different sleep patterns and it was unwise to compare them with others and instead advised trying to sleep when your baby sleeps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS has also broken down different sleeping patterns for different babies at different stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It advised that newborns need the most amount of sleep and are often asleep more than they're awake, averaging 18 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies often wake up in the night for feeding or because they need their nappy changing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While babies aged six months to a year old may be able to sleep for longer periods of time but can wake up due to teething or hunger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two-year-olds will often need to sleep for between 12 to 15 hours a day, including naps while children over the age of three can often get through the day without a nap.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 08:07:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQdTV4dHNUX0h3MDZSWV84bWdMYmtMRlhzSnV3QTlVOTlUci1NdE1qLXFxZ3VHQkFWMlZybjlUOFRNa1hmd1pScV92a29MMWxzVTQ2M0p2Smg2aXFjOXNxai1PUFJLVlJqYTJxZjg1emxMWWM1ek84aFYwUkg4bXFlYjQxY1QzNzZrZFdQcldLTdIBlAFBVV95cUxOYmF1WGR1Zk05Ni1DdUhkaHBVdTBmcFExcmtJZEJhd09NVTVjWXlmQTNEQW1JYjhqcEdDQWw1dkIxT2JablRoOEpXU29VaHpjS0ZBeUJaemozbzZQdDR5NWF4eTl0bHFfUTdoN2FHOE9VOS1wdm9Pb2pBSFNFTWE5aU5POXE2UHp6MGppeU5Tb3BWSVdn</guid></item><item><title>Prostate cancer test 'could save lives and embarrassment' - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBPZU9zZ295THkwN3JfV3NjZHg3X2hFT1czMW9kVlFPSW5KSFVkT0hrSC1fdkplT1dqMWIxZHlaTzZ1M3Z3RlNUQlVLQy1JSEswNUlCSmI1QUdXUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5nSUM2dG9oR1VONEFTanhSNVA2dUNtR0FzMFpSM0JRbXJ3TWNpaHFMWWRUdWxJNjk0N056QVpLMU1TRk5fdFdoM3pETHAyeHJaeVRVVWRLMjZJLVY5b2pj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Prostate test could 'save lives and embarrassment'&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Chris Jones.

important decisions" in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Like many men, I had no symptoms and wouldn't have thought to get tested," Mr Lewis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He is now undergoing treatment and is urging other men to get tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0

blood test measures the level of PSA protein, produced by the prostate gland, and may help detect early prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If a raised PSA level is detected, men may be offered an MRI scan of the prostate to help decide further if tests or treatment is needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But NHS Wales said results can be unreliable, so men are not routinely offered it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Welsh government said there is national guidance to support GPs to have discussions with asymptomatic men who are concerned about their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1

the charity's testing tour, nurse Amy Griffiths said the process is "literally a two second job".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We take one sample of blood, it's sent off to the lab, and the results come back in the next few days," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Retired consultant urologist and Prostate Cymru chairman, Andy Thomas, said the demand is high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's the first part of the process in being diagnosed, or excluded, of having prostate cancer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We used to test men with our fingers, and that's really put off men from being tested, so the PSA test has been deemed more important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Prostate Cymru chariman, Andy Thomas, said demand for the test is

getting a test from a GP isn't always easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We constantly hear of men who have had difficulties in obtaining a GP appointment, and in some cases being refused a test," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The evidence tells us that if we could make it easier for men to get tested, more men would welcome a test."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;More than 3,000 tests will be made available, costing over £100,000, the charity said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It has seven remaining testing dates in its tour, stopping in Cowbridge, Brecon, Swansea, Cardiff, Llanelli, Narbeth and Aberystwyth, and is exploring options in north Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Welsh Government said: "A PSA test is not always the right intervention for men without symptoms of prostate cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Men who do not have any symptoms but are concerned about their risk should seek advice from their GP before undertaking a PSA test."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 06:17:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"
