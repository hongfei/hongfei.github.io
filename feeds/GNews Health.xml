              &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a title="Grist" href="https://grist.org"&gt;Grist&lt;/a&gt;. Sign up for Grist’s &lt;a title="Weekly newsletter" href="https://go.grist.org/signup/weekly/partner?utm_campaign=republish-content&amp;amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;amp;utm_source=partner"&gt;weekly newsletter here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Throughout the Yangtze River Delta, a region in southern China famed for its widespread rice production, farmers grow belts of slender green stalks. Before they reach several feet tall and turn golden brown, the grassy plants soak in muddy, waterlogged fields for months. Along the rows of submerged plants, levees store and distribute a steady supply of water that farmers source from nearby canals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;This traditional practice of flooding paddies to raise the notoriously thirsty crop is almost as old as the ancient grain’s domestication. Thousands of years later, the agricultural method continues to predominate in rice cultivation practices from the low-lying fields of Arkansas to the sprawling terraces of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;As the planet heats up, this popular process of growing rice is becoming increasingly more dangerous for the millions of people worldwide that eat the grain regularly, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00055-5/fulltext"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in the journal Lancet Planetary Health. After drinking water, the researchers say, rice is the world’s second largest dietary source of inorganic arsenic, and climate change appears to be increasing the amount of the highly toxic chemical that is in it. If nothing is done to transform how most of the world’s rice is produced, regulate how much of it people consume, or mitigate warming, the authors conclude that communities with rice-heavy diets could begin confronting increased risks of cancer and disease as soon as 2050.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“Our results are very scary,” said Donming Wang, the ecological doctorate student at the Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences who led the paper. “It’s a disaster … and a wake-up call.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Back in 2014, Wang and an international team of climate, plant, and public health scientists started working together on a research project that would end up taking them close to a decade to complete. Wading through rice paddies across the Yangtze Delta, they sought to find out just how projected temperatures and levels of atmospheric CO2 in 2050 would interact with the arsenic in the soil and the rice crops planted there. They knew, from past research, that the carcinogen was a problem in rice crops, but wanted to find out how much more of an issue it might be in a warming world. The team didn’t look at just any rice, but some of the grain varieties most produced and consumed worldwide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Although there are &lt;a href="https://www.riceassociation.org.uk/types-of-rice"&gt;an estimated 40,000 types of rice&lt;/a&gt; on the planet, they tend to be grouped into three categories based on length of the grain. Short-grain rice, or the sticky kind often used in sushi; long-grain, which includes aromatic types like basmati and jasmine; and medium-grain, or rice that tends to be &lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/types-of-rice?srsltid=AfmBOop6Nx25mqFpHopqAD6gC-ZdLve2kvlZ8nEYym0Dfl8RwLT2cIxb"&gt;served as a main dish&lt;/a&gt;. Of these, the short-to-medium japonica and long-grain indica are the &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.857896/full"&gt;two major subspecies of cultivated rice&lt;/a&gt; eaten across Asia. Wang’s study modelled the growth of 28 varieties of japonica, indica, and hybrid rice strains central to cuisine for seven of the continent’s top rice consuming and producing countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, and Vietnam. India, Vietnam, and China are among the group of &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/rice/trade#:~:text=Despite%20its%20current%20export%20restrictions,of%20annual%20global%20rice%20exports."&gt;eight nations&lt;/a&gt; that lead the rest of the world in rice exports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;After nearly a decade of observing and analyzing the growth of the plants, the researchers discovered that the combination of higher temperatures and CO2 encourages root growth, increasing the ability of rice plants to uptake arsenic from the soil. They believe this is because climate-related changes in soil chemistry that favor arsenic can be more easily absorbed into the grain. Carbon-dioxide enriched crops were found to capture more atmospheric carbon and pump some of that into the soil, stimulating microbes that are making arsenic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;The more root growth, the more carbon in the soil, which can be a source of food for soil bacteria that multiply under warming temperatures. When soil in a rice paddy is waterlogged, oxygen gets depleted, causing the soil bacteria to rely further on arsenic to generate energy. The end result is more arsenic building up in the rice paddy, and more roots to take it up to the developing grain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;These arsenic-accumulating effects linked to increased root growth and carbon capture is a paradoxical surprise to Corey Lesk, a Dartmouth College postdoctoral climate and crop researcher unaffiliated with the paper. The paradox, said Lesk, is that both of these outcomes have been talked about as potential benefits to rice yields under climate change. “More roots could make the rice more drought-resistant, and cheaper carbon can boost yields generally,” he said. “But the extra arsenic accumulation could make it hard to realize health benefits from that yield boost.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Arsenic comes in many different forms. Notoriously toxic, inorganic arsenic — compounds of the element that don’t contain carbon — is what the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/arsenic"&gt;classifies&lt;/a&gt; as a “confirmed carcinogen” and “the most significant chemical contaminant in drinking water globally.” Such forms of arsenic are &lt;a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/toxmetal/arsenic/the-facts-on-arsenic/"&gt;typically more toxic&lt;/a&gt; to humans because they are less stable than their organic counterparts and may allow arsenic to interact with molecules that ramp up exposure. Chronic exposure has been linked to lung, bladder, and skin cancers, as well as heart disease, diabetes, adverse pregnancy, neurodevelopmental issues, and weakened immune systems, among other health impacts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Scientists and public-health specialists have known for years that the presence of arsenic in food is a mounting threat, but dietary exposure has long been considered much less of a risk in comparison to contaminated groundwater. So policy measures to mitigate the risk have been slow going. The few existing standards that have been enacted by the European Union and China, for example, are considered inconsistent and largely unenforced. No country has formally established regulations for organic arsenic exposure in foods. (In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has established &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/chemical-metals-natural-toxins-pesticides-guidance-documents-regulations/supporting-document-action-level-inorganic-arsenic-rice-cereals-infants"&gt;an action level of 100 parts per billion of inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal&lt;/a&gt;, but that recommendation for manufacturers isn’t an enforceable regulation on arsenic in rice or any other food.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Wang hopes to see this change. The levels of inorganic arsenic commonly found in rice today fall within China’s recommended standards, for example, but her paper shows that lifetime bladder and lung cancer incidences are likely to increase “proportionally” to exposure by 2050. Under a “worst case” climate scenario, where global temperatures rise above 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and are coupled with CO2 levels that increase another &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/humans-didnt-exist-the-last-time-there-was-this-much-co2-in-the-air/"&gt;200 parts per million&lt;/a&gt;, the levels of inorganic arsenic in the rice varieties studied are projected to surge by a whopping 44 percent. That means that more than half the rice samples would exceed China’s current proposed limit, which limits 200 parts per billion for inorganic arsenic in paddy rice, with an estimated 13.4 million cancers linked to rice-based arsenic exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Because these health risks are in part calculated based on body weight, infants and young children will face the biggest health burdens. Babies, in particular, may end up facing outsize risks through the consumption of rice cereals, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“You’re talking about a crop staple that feeds billions of people, and when you consider that more carbon dioxide and warmer temperatures can significantly influence the amount of arsenic in that staple, the amount of health consequences related to that are, for lack of a better word, enormous,” said study coauthor Lewis Ziska, a plant biologist researching climate change and public health at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;But everyone should not suddenly stop eating rice as a result, he added. Though the team found the amount of inorganic arsenic in rice is higher than a lot of other plants, it’s still quite low overall. The key variable is how much rice a person eats. If you are among the bulk of the world that consumes rice multiple times a week, this looming health burden could apply to you, but if you do so more sporadically, Ziska says, the inorganic arsenic you may end up exposed to won’t be “a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;In that way, the study’s projections may also deepen existing global and social inequities, as a big reason rice has long reigned as one of the planet’s most devoured grains is because it’s also among the most affordable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Beyond mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions — what Ziska calls “waving my rainbows, unicorns, and sprinkles wand” — adaptation efforts to avoid a future with toxic rice include rice paddy farmers planting earlier in the season to avoid seeds developing under warmer temperatures, better soil management, and plant breeding to minimize rice’s propensity to accumulate so much arsenic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Water-saving irrigation techniques such as alternate wetting and drying, where paddy fields are first flooded and then allowed to dry in a cycle, could also be used to reduce these increasing health risks &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the grain’s enormous methane footprint. On a global scale, rice production accounts for roughly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/20/climate/rice-farming-climate-change.html"&gt;8 percent of all methane emissions from human activity&lt;/a&gt; — flooded paddy fields are ideal conditions for &lt;a href="https://climateandhealthalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MethaneReport-Ag-FINAL.pdf"&gt;methane-emitting bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“This is an area that I know is not sexy, that doesn’t have the same vibe as the end of the world, rising sea levels, category 10 storms,” said Ziska. “But I will tell you quite honestly that it will have the greatest effect in terms of humanity, because we all eat.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared in &lt;a href="https://grist.org/"&gt;Grist&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/the-king-of-poisons-arsenic-is-building-up-in-rice/"&gt;https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/the-king-of-poisons-arsenic-is-building-up-in-rice/&lt;/a&gt;.

That ambulance took her to Mercy Medical Center in Aurora, which is only a four-minute drive away from the Albrights’ home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a hospital the two had been to before — he had previously been hospitalized there after a stroke, and his wife had surgery done there, Rick Albright told The Beacon-News. He said the two had long been cared for by doctors with Advocate Health Care, a non-profit medical group with a large presence in Aurora, and when they previously went to Mercy Medical Center, Advocate doctors were there to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the two arrived at Mercy Medical Center’s emergency room on Christmas Eve in 2023 and learned she had a gastric issue, they were told that her Advocate gastroenterologist, the same one who had previously operated on her at that same hospital, would not be able to see her, according to Rick Albright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said it was the first time he’d heard that Advocate doctors may not be able to see them at Mercy Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the on-call doctor did a great job, eventually doing surgery to remove some gallstones, it was “completely luck of the draw,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of stories could become more common now that Advocate has pulled its doctors out of Mercy Medical Center without broadly informing its patients of the change. Around a half-dozen people who currently work or recently stopped working at Mercy confirmed to The Beacon-News that Advocate doctors were being pulled from Mercy Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement sent to The Beacon-News, Advocate said that it is “shifting all hospital-based services to Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove and surrounding hospitals,” which is being done to “provide the best and highest quality care for our patients where they need it most” and “help us continue to coordinate and integrate care for our patients who need hospital-based services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the care Advocate provides to its patients takes place at its clinics, the locations of which are not changing, according to the statement from Advocate.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;When an Advocate spokesperson was asked when and how patients are being notified of this change, they said it is being done “as part of the scheduling process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Healthcare, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/03/01/ascension-completes-sale-of-9-illinois-hospitals-to-prime-healthcare-for-more-than-370-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;bought Mercy Medical Center along with a number of other hospitals from Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, also confirmed that Advocate Heath has decided to “prohibit their physicians from continuing to provide care at our hospital.” However, there is currently “no impact to the hospital’s emergency care and no impact to patient care or access,” a Mercy spokesperson recently told The Beacon-News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Healthcare asked Advocate to reconsider its decision, but “our efforts were declined,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight Advocate cardiologists, the last Advocate physicians at the hospital, were officially pulled out of Mercy Medical Center on April 5, according to the Mercy spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocate previously offered other types of care at Mercy — including ENT, pulmonology, urology, and hospitalist care — but those doctors were pulled out ahead of Prime’s purchase of the hospital, the Mercy spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Vitale, a certified registered nurse anesthetist who has been working at Mercy Medical Center for about 15 years, said that Advocate general surgeons and gastroenterologists were among the first to go. Both have been gone for over a year, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Advocate Health Care doctors were pulled out late last year or the start of this year, including orthopedics; ear, nose and throat doctors; pulmonology; urology; critical care doctors; podiatry and hospitalists, according to Richa Sharma, a doctor who up until Feb. 14 worked in Mercy Medical Center’s intensive care unit and was the hospital’s chair of internal medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharma and Vitale, neither of whom work for Advocate Health, were among those who agreed to come forward publicly to confirm Advocate was pulling its doctors out of Mercy Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharma said that Advocate hospitalists used to make up between 30% and 50% of all the hospitalists working at Mercy Medical Center. Hospitalists act as general doctors and coordinate care among other physicians for patients in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Mercy Medical Center’s surgical care also used to come from Advocate Health Care, according to Vitale. While she has seen a lot of changes in administration at Mercy over the years, she has never seen anything like this, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked to confirm which types of Advocate doctors no longer work at Mercy Medical Center, an Advocate spokesperson referred to the company’s statement on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some specialist departments at Mercy Medical Center were hit harder by Advocate’s pull-out than others. Sharma told The Beacon-News late last year that the group she works for — Sound Physicians — was contracted to provide 50% of critical care at Mercy, while the other half came from Advocate Health Care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Healthcare decided to go with a different group for critical care services, which is why Sharma no longer works at Mercy, she told The Beacon-News last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Medical Center’s pulmonology, orthopedic surgery and ear, nose and throat departments used to also be staffed primarily by Advocate doctors, according to Sharma. But, she said late last year that there was another group already providing podiatry services at Mercy, and they were going to continue, so “that wouldn’t be a huge gap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, Sharma said at the time, was that Advocate pulling out of Mercy Medical Center was an additional layer of instability on top of the instability caused by Prime’s purchase of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Prime now says it has closed any gaps left by Advocate pulling out its doctors, Sharma said in January that the hospital was having to make deals with other local hospitals to take patients because of gaps in coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the anticipated effects are playing out currently,” Sharma said in January about Advocate pulling its doctors out of Mercy Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, deals were still being worked out with groups to cover orthopedics and urology, there was no pulmonology coverage and there were questions around ear, nose and throat coverage, she said in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Albright called the situation “silly” when he spoke to The Beacon-News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re the second biggest city in Illinois, and Advocate, who I’ve been involved with since they were Dreyer, they’re trying to send us all over the place for our procedures,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Rose Anne Albright had wanted to see her own Advocate doctor that Christmas Eve after being examined while in great pain at Mercy Medical Center, the same hospital where her Advocate doctor previously handled her surgery, she would have needed to take another ambulance to Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove, which “makes no sense at all and is extremely expensive,” Rick Albright said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those with Advocate doctors are still able to come get procedures done at Mercy, it would be out of network for them, Sharma told The Beacon-News. She said that means procedures may be more costly and harder to get approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Medical Center provides care to an “underserved community,” and many local residents are no longer going to have access to hospital care within their own community if they are patients of Advocate Health Care and do not have the means to travel beyond the city, according to Vitale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern of Vitale’s is that, as Mercy Medical Center loses doctors, quality staff may also be lost. She also wonders if Mercy will be able to maintain the same standard of care that the hospital has provided over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She loves the hospital, she said, and thinks it is a unique place that has maintained a community and family feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s strategically in a great location. It’s in the middle of a large community of people,” Vitale said about Mercy Medical Center. “I feel like this community needs that resource.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocate Health Care has similarly pulled doctors out of Rush Copley Medical Center, the other hospital in Aurora, but that process has been more gradual than what happened at Mercy, Rush Copley’s President and CEO John Diederich told The Beacon-News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, Advocate doctors used to make up around 50% of Rush Copley’s patient care revenue, but that has been dropping since then, falling to around 35% in the 2000s and to around 25% in the 2010s, according to Diederich. He said a more “dramatic” pull-out happened in 2022, when Advocate did not renew the lease on a large space on Rush Copley’s campus that it held for 13 years then started pulling its doctors from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between mid-2022 and early 2023, 90% of Advocate specialists resigned from Rush Copley’s medical staff, Diederich said. That included Advocate ophthalmologists, pulmonologists, orthopedic surgeons, general surgeons, GI doctors and OB-GYNs, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Advocate doctors remain, including cardiologists, nephrologists and hospitalists, but they only make up around 5% of the hospital’s patient care revenue at this point, Diederich said in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Advocate Health Care’s pullout of Rush Copley was a hit to the hospital’s revenues, which Diederich called a “short-term bump,” Rush Copley has been able to recover, both filling in the gaps that Advocate left behind with its own medical group and expanding that medical group to keep up with the community’s growth, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think Advocate’s short-term strategy was our long-term opportunity,” Diederich said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Medical Center’s spokesperson said that, despite Advocate pulling its doctors out, the hospital has no gaps in care or coverage and remains “deeply committed to our mission of providing compassionate, accessible and community-based care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Prime Healthcare has successfully transitioned services in the past, and we will continue to do so with the same level of diligence and dedication,” the spokesperson said. “Our patients deserve nothing less.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3012001b3b73llcxj7kr@published"&gt;My husband, “Mason,” and I have a 6-year-old daughter, “Evelyn,” who is the joy of our lives. She is an only child and we are satisfied with keeping it that way. The problem is my mother-in-law, “Clara.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="175" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na304r001c3b73fy23y7u2@published"&gt;For the past few years, Clara has insisted that Evelyn needs a sibling so she doesn’t grow up “spoiled and lonely.” She is convinced Evelyn will be “socially deprived” without the experience of having a sibling. But Evelyn is none of those things. Mason and I have clear boundaries and expectations for our daughter, and she has many friends at school and in her martial arts class; she is a happy, well-adjusted child. The other day, when she was at a friend’s for a play date, her friend’s 3-year-old brother ran up and kicked over a tower of blocks Evelyn and her friend had been stacking. After we got home, Evelyn told me she was glad not to have a younger brother or sister. So it’s not as if she’s feeling deprived! Clara, however, cannot seem to accept the fact that Evelyn is going to remain an only child. All our assurances that she and we are fine with things as they are fall on deaf ears. How can I get her to butt out?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na30dl001f3b73jmxu6ikc@published"&gt;For starters, instead of continuing to assure her that you, her son, and her grandchild are happy as you all are (which she either doesn’t believe or thinks is irrelevant), it’s time to address the overarching issue: her feeling entitled to offer this unasked-for advice—and not just once, but again and again. Tell her directly—or, better yet, ask her son to tell her directly—that this isn’t something that’s open for discussion with her. You’ve let this go on for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;. It’s time to put a stop to it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na30g6001g3b73k0k7u7q5@published"&gt;I feel honor bound to point out that telling her directly to butt out probably won’t work. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. It’s important to communicate clearly with the people in our lives; it’s important to set boundaries with them, too. While you can’t actually “get” her to lay off, you can—and should—refuse to engage if (when) she continues to offer her two cents (on this and any other off-limits topic). Raise an eyebrow, sigh loudly, say, “We talked about this, remember?” or just blithely change the subject. You can end the conversation altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="159" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na30l3001h3b73l24kidf7@published"&gt;I have to ask (it’s my job to ask) if there’s any chance that she’s hitting a nerve with her constant criticism (because that is what this amounts to). Often when someone gets under our skin this way, it’s at least partly because they’re poking at a sensitive spot. &lt;em&gt;Do&lt;/em&gt; you have any nagging doubts you’re suppressing? I think it’s worth asking yourself this question for your own sake, entirely separate from your buttinsky mother-in-law problem. (For the record, I am a big fan of only children and the parents who have them.) As to that buttinsky mother-in-law herself, perhaps it will help to remind yourself that you don’t know what her motivation is. Is she really worried about Evelyn? (Maybe. But that’s her problem, not yours.) Does she simply want more grandchildren? (Again, not your problem.) Is she just the sort of person who believes she always knows best? (I could keep going, but you get the idea.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpa001q3b73urdpa5dh@published"&gt;My family and I live down the block from my sister and her family. They went away for spring break to visit her in-laws and tasked my 12-year-old daughter “Blair” with feeding their tropical fish while they were gone.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="188" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpa001r3b73wljlyqpt@published"&gt;The day before they were due back, Blair went over in the morning to feed the fish and discovered they were all dead. It turned out that the tank heater had failed at some point during the previous day after Blair took care of them. The problem is that my sister is blaming Blair for “killing” her fish and demanding that we pay for new ones. Blair feels terrible about what happened, but she did a temperature check of the water before she left on the last day they were alive, and the temperature was where it was supposed to be (she had been writing it down on the daily temperature log, so we know for sure), so there was no negligence on her part. I explained this to my sister, but she won’t budge.  Now she says Blair and her cousins (with whom she is very close) can’t play together until we pay for new fish. My husband thinks this is outrageous, and I agree. Even so, would buying some new fish be worth it so we can put this in the rearview mirror for Blair’s sake?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpc001u3b73pb9foxhs@published"&gt;Are you sure this is about the fish? What’s your relationship with your sister like, anyway? It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; outrageous for her to demand that you pay to replace the fish that died because of her faulty heater. (Has Blair talked to her herself? Does she think Blair is lying? Or are you the one doing all the talking, relaying to your sister what Blair has told you—and does she think &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are lying? Do you and your sister have a long history of anger and bitterness between you? Or does your sister have a history of lashing out and blaming others for her misfortunes?)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpc001v3b73jvslvlfo@published"&gt;Whatever is behind this, you need to have a conversation. Giving in to your sister’s blackmail, replacing the fish “for Blair’s sake,” so that she will be allowed to play with her cousins, will put only this very specific situation in the rearview mirror—it will not solve the underlying problem. If that problem cannot be solved (or if you don’t care enough to want to solve it; if your relationship with your sister has always been rocky and you’re fine with keeping the status quo), but you don’t want the kids to suffer for it, I would go ahead and pay for the fish if you can afford it, simply to keep the peace. But I would have a frank talk with Blair about why you’re doing this. Otherwise, it will be very confusing to her, as it suggests that you do consider her at fault.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpd001w3b73wexgsgit@published"&gt;And if the matter is “resolved” in this way, I would definitely not have her be “tasked” with any house- or pet-sitting or other duties for her aunt in the future. Give her permission to politely decline such requests.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na3gpd001x3b73xzhwijdw@published"&gt;But oh how I hope—optimist that I am—that you and your sister can have a healthy, honest, authentic conversation that provides insight for both of you into the real reasons for this conflict, and that your relationship going forward is itself healthier, more honest, and more authentic. It is what I wish for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na4soa00263b73oow3ngq9@published"&gt;My granddaughter, “Carmen,” is very bright and bubbly most of the time. A few years ago, a freak accident triggered a chronic illness. She can walk, usually with a cane, but for long distances she usually makes use of a wheelchair. She has been complaining to me lately about how her parents baby her. For example, if her brothers want to take part in a family activity in an area of the city that isn’t wheelchair-accessible, her parents will dismiss the idea “for Carmen’s sake,” even though Carmen herself feels perfectly capable of walking for the distance required.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9nbus0600043b74ab68huyz@published"&gt;It’d be one thing if she were 5 or 6 years old, but Carmen is 10, and a 10-year-old who has grown up very quickly. Perhaps because of the months she has spent in and out of the hospital, she is more mature than many other kids her age. I personally trust Carmen’s ability to judge her own abilities. I also understand that Carmen’s parents are scared. But their overprotectiveness is not doing Carmen any favors. I’m not sure how best to broach the conversation with my son and daughter-in-law. They have both been very defensive in the past about the way they handled Carmen’s hospitalization and illness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na4soe00293b73sn3zwq2b@published"&gt;Don’t broach the conversation at all. I promise you: Your advice on this matter will not be welcome. If you were paying attention, you might have learned this lesson when they were “defensive” about the way they “handled” Carmen’s illness and hospitalization years ago. Think of it this way: They should not have to defend their parenting to their child’s grandmother. The child’s grandmother should be keeping her own counsel.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9na4soe002a3b739qg6duak@published"&gt;What you can do, of course, is be supportive of Carmen. When she comes to you complaining about her parents, you can be sympathetic (“That must be frustrating for you!”), you can encourage her to find ways to let her parents know that she may be able to handle more than they think she can, and you can do things with her yourself that provide her more opportunities to challenge herself. But the bottom line here is that no matter what a grandparent thinks the right way to be a parent to their grandchild is—short of knowledge of abuse, of course—it’s not their place to say so.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Administration officials maintain that certain life saving aid — like HIV medications — has been spared. But people on the ground tell a different story.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR reached out to the Zambian government for comment on the impact of the cuts and to the U.S. State Department as well. Neither responded to our inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR spoke with dozens of HIV-positive people in Zambia to learn the impact on them. They consistently report chaos and confusion — and, increasingly, people falling ill without their HIV medication. Here are some of their stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;Dorcas and Theresa Mwanza: 'She's a very jovial little girl, but she's been very miserable'&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59786" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;"Jovial."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's the word Theresa Mwanza, 32, liked to use to describe her 10-year-old daughter, Dorcas. When Dorcas would get home from school, she'd often play house, pretending to prepare nshima — a thick traditional porridge — for her imaginary family. "I'm thinking she'll be very family-oriented when she grows up," says Theresa in Bemba, a local language spoken in parts of Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When NPR met with the family in early April, it had been eight days since both Dorcas and her mom, Theresa, took the last of their HIV medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A single mom and an only child, they've always taken their medicine together at 8 p.m. each night. The change in routine has confused the little girl.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60048" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                After the USAID clinic closed, Theresa Mwanza, left, tried to get HIV medications for herself and her daughter, Dorcas, at a government run clinic but was turned away.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"She'll open the tin [where the medicine is kept] and find that it's empty," says Theresa. "She'll run down to the clinic to go and check if she can collect her medication. And then she'll come back home and say, 'Oh, you are right. The clinic is closed. They're not there anymore.' "&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And it seems like their U.S.-funded clinic is not coming back. The doors of the clinic, which services over 2,000 HIV patients, have been locked since the end of January, the staff let go and the furniture largely removed. This clinic didn't just provide medication, it also provided basic food since HIV medicine cannot be taken on an empty stomach. Theresa and Dorcas lost both.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59948" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;So far, without their medication, Theresa feels okay. But Dorcas has developed a fever and chills — and she feels weak. Flu-like symptoms are often one of the first symptoms after someone goes off HIV treatment — the level of virus rises and the body tries to fight it off. Worried, Theresa now stays home to tend to her daughter — who often rests on a mat by the tree outside their home. But it means Theresa isn't going house to house to do laundry and odd jobs, their main source of income.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Theresa tried to get their medications at a clinic run by the Zambian government. It took an hour to walk there only to get turned away. "They keep insisting: 'You need to get direction or guidance from the clinic where you were on where you will go to next,'" she recalls. But with her neighborhood clinic closed, Theresa isn't sure what to do.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59788" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Before medication became available for free with help with the U.S., Theresa Mwanza's two sisters died of AIDS.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;She thinks back to her two sisters who died of AIDS before medication became available — and free with help from the U.S. "I am now really worried," she says looking at her daughter. "She's a very jovial little girl, but she's been very miserable the past few days."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;Mary Mayongana: 'What will become of me?'&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mary Mayongana, 42, typically spends her days either at the market selling vegetables or in a small family compound she shares with her family: Her mother, her four children, her two sisters and their children. "All of us live here as one big family," Mary says, speaking in Bemba.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59881" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Mary Mayongana, 42, is unsure whether her ankle sore is a result of going off her HIV medications. She says that the pain along with the fatigue she now feels are going to make it hard to walk for 45 minutes to reach the nearest clinic after the closure of the U.S.-funded clinic she had previously used.
                &lt;b class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Now, Mary is confined to that compound. She's lost access to her HIV treatment and feels weak. She's also developed an itchy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/31/g-s1-45601/trump-pepfar-hiv-positive-antiretroviral-waiver" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rash&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a classic sign of going off HIV medications — it can be an indication that the body is trying to fight off &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-rash" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the resurgent virus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the immune system is weakening. And Mary has another challenge: her ankle is swollen from a painful open sore that continues to spread.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Without warning, her U.S.-funded clinic closed on January 28 with a stop work order from the Trump Administration. Now the clinic's health workers are distributing the remaining supply of medications among all the patients. For more than two months, Mary hasn't been able to consistently take her HIV medication. Sometimes she's gone up to 14 days with no HIV medication at all. Right now, she has a few pills and has decided to take them every third day. It's risky because her body could develop resistance to the drug if it's not taken daily. But, Mary says, it's all she has so she needs her supply to last as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59784" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                "I spend a lot of time thinking about what is likely to become of me, especially that I'm actually seeing myself wasting away," says Mary, who for more than two months, hasn't been able to consistently take her HIV medication.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There are Zambian government clinics that still stock HIV drugs but they've been so overwhelmed by HIV patients from the shuttered U.S.-funded clinics that they've been forced to ration the medication, giving out a limited supply to each patient. And for Mary, who has no money for transportation, the government clinic seems impossibly far away. It's a 45-minute walk on a good day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She's unsure whether her ankle sore is a result of going off her HIV medications but, she says, the pain and fatigue she feels are going to make it hard to walk to the clinic. She thinks it will take her hours each way. Her mother is urging her to do it anyway — together, she says, they can take a few steps, then rest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I spend a lot of time thinking about what is likely to become of me, especially that I'm actually seeing myself wasting away," says Mary in a flat, quiet voice. She sits on the cement floor of her brick home, her head resting against the wall. "It's really weighing me down."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60045" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

He's a house painter and — with the help of HIV medication, which he's taken for 15 years — he always had the strength to do his work. But no longer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I feel weakness — weak, weak, weak," he says as his voice cracks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-61289" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Since early February, when his local U.S.-funded clinic shut down, he's struggled to get his medication. At first, he managed to obtain a few pills here and there but, now, he's out entirely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sitting on a wooden bench by the window with one of his three children nearby, he says he's lost a lot of weight and feels like all the power has been drained out of him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59783" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Brian's wife also has HIV and has run out of her medication, too. But, so far, she says she feels fine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The couple went to a nearby government clinic hoping they would be able to get their medications refilled. But, they say, they were told they must bring their medical records in order to register as new patients. So they've been going back to their old clinic to get their files. Every time they go, it's still shuttered. And yet, he says, they have no choice but to keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We need to wait until there's someone at the &lt;a href="https://www.usaid.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;USAID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; facility," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59798" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;From the two-room house — under a huge mango tree — that she shares with her grandmother, Catherine lets the lyrics of her favorite song, "Nessa's Holy Spirit," wash over her:&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Jesus I need you to survive.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Oh come oh! Holy Spirit come oh"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her grandmother, who has the same name, says Catherine has been grappling with two questions for which there are no good answers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She began to ask why she's taking this medication, and then I had to explain to her that 'You're HIV positive,' " says Catherine's grandmother. The girl got the virus from her mother at birth but, her grandmother says, "it's been very difficult to get her to accept her situation. She says, 'What is it that I have done to get this illness?' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Holy Spirit come,&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Come and have your way"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lately Catherine's question of "why" has been superseded by the question of "how." How will she get her next round of HIV medications when the health center where she got her free HIV medications was funded by the U.S. and has now shut down. She has one month's supply left and she worries that all the government clinics will charge money for the medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Even if I go there, they [will] say, we should buy medicines. And actually, I'm a school girl and I don't have money. And [my grandmother] just sells some tomatoes so that she can earn money to provide for the food," Catherine says, in a low, flat voice as a tear traces its way down her cheek. "I've heard that there are many millions of people going to die."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59793" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

However, researchers are now learning that it doesn't take much for microplastic particles to make their way into our food and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A growing number of scientists have noted that microplastics have the ability to easily shed into food and water without much effort. While many people might assume that overuse is the main concern in microplastic exposure, the truth is that these microscopic plastic particles may end up in your food after just one use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Victoria Fulfer, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Rhode Island, said the prevalence of plastic use in food packaging only amplifies the concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Mostly, when a container says 'microwave safe,' it means it's safe for the container to be in the microwave, it's not going to melt," Fulfer &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/doesnt-take-much-microplastics-leach-food-researchers-warn-rcna198975" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"But that doesn't mean that it's safe for you as a person, because microwaving plastic particularly changes the chemical bonds," Fulfer added. "They make them more weak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is microplastic exposure important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of the Grossman Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards at New York University, explained that microplastic exposure can lead to an array of severe health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We're talking about cardiovascular mortality," Trasande &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/doesnt-take-much-microplastics-leach-food-researchers-warn-rcna198975" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; NBC News. "We're also talking about hormone-sensitive cancers. Breast, thyroid, ovarian, not to mention kidney cancer, that have been associated with these chemical exposures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite the &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increasing health risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;increasing health risk&lt;/a&gt; that comes along with microplastic exposure, scientists note that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10151227/#:~:text=In%20vitro%20experiments%20with%20human,gut%20microbiota%20dysbiosis%2C%20and%20neurotoxicity." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more research&lt;/a&gt; needs to be done to determine the extent of the possible damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about reducing microplastic use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396424004584#sec4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Trasande, there are ways that we may be able to address this growing concern. "Preventing plastic exposure is very much possible," Trasande &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396424004584#sec4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wrote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researcher suggested that by including color-based additives to chemicals in plastic creation, we can help visualize the abundance of plastic in our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Looking to the next ten years ahead, biomonitoring initiatives are needed to visualise this issue, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries," Trasande added. "The technology to measure [micro- and nanoplastics] will eventually advance and make concerns even more apparent, but the threat of the invisible requires us to act now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the meantime, legislators have worked to progress measures to minimize the production of single-use plastics. In 2023, Senator Jeff Merkley introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3127/text" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act of 2023;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act of 2023&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to "prevent pollution from consumer products and packaging from entering into animal and human food chains and waterways, and for other purposes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2019, 170 countries pledged to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47592111" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:significantly reduce;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;significantly reduce&lt;/a&gt; the use of plastics by 2030. Since then, the UN Environment Assembly has worked to proactively address the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Plastic pollution has grown into an epidemic," &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113142#:~:text=2%20March%202022%20Climate%20and,its%20production%2C%20design%20and%20disposal." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Espen Barth Eide, Norway's minister for climate and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/hacks-newsletter/?recHHuHYPvXlOvd6u" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for easy tips to &lt;strong&gt;save more&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;waste less&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 11:30:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQRTVSUDNTaldCUlk5Y0NhVXhaUjd2MnY2YmluT0JTV3YyQ2NvLUFDNndaX0NIb0hpanNIRDI5OEFwNmlTRGM1QXp0eG05N3gtS3V0UXRSQ00wbHNNSG1PVTQ0VDBNUG1LVDFmVDdVUTItWkZXb1pTd1FTbG00RXZvRmljS2VZaDZCc05Zalpxbw</guid></item><item><title>成年期自闭症的9大征兆- HuffPost | The 9 Biggest Signs Of Autism In Adulthood - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxObWV1X2xfaFdkb3ZRanlsRDFCVVJFTGlwMS1WS0RadnlsQlpFQlJBbUVPUUhrU0RtcmVHOTNzYUdpTGlSSW5HLWRLVXhfNmRadGZDei0yRHRFdXdnYUFhcUZIMjFzYmc1TzdMLXg4bjNZb050RnJiZ2Rkb3VtWlhsOEhROEpiMjZpYlNIVC0tY0kyMlZ5UXNURF9kdkxHai1IbjRQUmpKVU_SAa4BQVVfeXFMT2lvT01mM3psMXBnM0RzVmREazVXSTlMZVVBb2M2VzY0dTdwQW9QLWJlVU9CcW5kSUFodmdCQjRiM3p6RlhNWmRzRTVyUTY2MzNYWnBMSzN0OXZnT0gtQ1h2bDFUYk9IcTA3N0xjNHpheGoxUWNJRGtBcWNpczJCeWRFM1BGdGJRemtnVU92eEszaERiQUdUT05YUldTa3VuWGc5V1htSmJlLTFaS2Jn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have seen &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sunnygiovanni/video/7205024706439728426" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="videos" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.tiktok.com/@sunnygiovanni/video/7205024706439728426" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; on social media where people detail the signs that made them realize they’re autistic.

Additionally,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the autism diagnostic tools used today were developed exclusively on white boys from high socioeconomic status, said &lt;a href="https://www.stephaniegardnerwright.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Stephanie Gardner-Wright" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.stephaniegardnerwright.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Stephanie Gardner-Wright&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed master social worker and certified autism clinical specialist in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a huge focus on the external signs and not so much the internal symptoms of autism, Gardner-Wright said. And those internal symptoms are very different from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There are so many ways that autism can show up and present,” Neff added. “I think there’s more diversity within autism than there is between autism and allistic.” (Allistic people are folks who aren’t on the autism spectrum.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That said, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;there are a number of signs or thought patterns that undiagnosed autistic people may be able to relate to. &lt;/span&gt;HuffPost spoke with mental health professionals, including some people who are neurodivergent themselves, about the signs of autism in adulthood:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Feeling Of Being ‘Different’ From Others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four experts shared that it’s common for autistic people to feel different. &lt;a href="https://effectiveartistry.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Brandon Tessers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://effectiveartistry.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Brandon Tessers&lt;/a&gt;, the director of Effective Artistry, a therapy group that supports neurodivergent people, said some folks will describe it as “&lt;span&gt;feeling like an alien sometimes,” while &lt;a href="https://gsapp.rutgers.edu/faculty/vanessa-bal" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Vanessa Bal" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://gsapp.rutgers.edu/faculty/vanessa-bal" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Vanessa Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Center for Adult Autism Services Psychological Services Clinic at Rutgers University in New Jersey said folks describe it as “a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;lifetime experience of feeling different.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The difference between this feeling and the occasional outsider feeling everyone deals with from time to time is that for autistic folks, this feeling does not come and go and is not only during one specific period, like middle school, Bal told HuffPost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardner-Wright added that this is a big indicator and an internal experience at that — you cannot look at a person and know if they feel like an outsider. The feeling could be overpowering or could be more subtle, it depends on the person, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, it’s important to know that autistic people don’t necessarily feel like outsiders all the time, Bal noted. They may find settings that are more inclusive for neurodivergent people. Additionally, some adults also say they feel more comfortable with who they are and worry less about differences, sometimes seeing them as strengths, as they get older, Bal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty With Social Cues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social cues are also another sign. Someone with undiagnosed autism may find they have trouble deciphering how much eye contact is appropriate or when they should stop smiling during a conversation, Gardner-Wright said. They may be able to mask these uncertainties by learning how much is appropriate, but it’s not an innate sense as it is with someone who is allistic, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Confusing Relationship History — Both Romantically Or Platonically&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Neff, many undiagnosed autistic adults have a confusing and complicated social relationship history. Additionally, romantic relationships may feel tough to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There might be relationships that have that kind of suddenly burst apart but the autistic person doesn’t understand why,” she said. When it comes to the reason behind this complicated relationship history, it’s likely that the person with autism doesn’t know why their relationships fail when other people’s don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sensitivity to sensory input — like noise and sight — is another potential sign of autism, said Gardner-Wright, who added that this can mean being hyper-aware of a sound or totally unaware.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are not autistic tend to be more or less responsive to sensory stimuli, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, an autistic person may find that they’re constantly aware of a ticking clock at a friend’s house or really sensitive to the sound of a loud siren, Gardner-Wright noted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Desire For Routine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with autism thrive on consistency. “&lt;span&gt;The world we occupy is much more uncertain and unpredict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;able. So we go to routine as a way of self-soothing,” Neff said. &lt;/span&gt;When a routine is disrupted, strong emotions may present, including intense irritability or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardner-Wright added that the routine doesn’t need to be super strict, either; it’s a common misconception when people think about people with autism’s day-to-day schedule. Instead, it could be a strong preference for a certain mug every morning. Routine looks different for different people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, big changes can be hard, too. “If &lt;span&gt;they move [homes] or they move careers, this could create a season of insomnia or anxiety,” Neff said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine can extend to certain behaviors as well. It also includes repetitive body movements, which is known as stimming, Neff added. &lt;a href="https://www.research.chop.edu/car-autism-roadmap/stimming-what-is-it-and-does-it-matter#:~:text=%22%20Stimming%20%2C%22%20also%20known%20as,spectrum%20engage%20in%20routine%20stimming%20." target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="According to the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania’s Research Institute" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.research.chop.edu/car-autism-roadmap/stimming-what-is-it-and-does-it-matter#:~:text=%22%20Stimming%20%2C%22%20also%20known%20as,spectrum%20engage%20in%20routine%20stimming%20." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;According to the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania’s Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, stimming behaviors can include body rocking, hand flapping, spinning, rubbing a specific surface and squealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Need For Solitude &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another common sign? “Needing solitude &lt;span&gt;to recharge after social situations or really overstimulating situations — and overstimulating could be different for everyone — but that is a very typical hallmark of [autism],” Gardner-Wright said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This could mean feeling totally exhausted after a work presentation or a family party.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bal said this exhaustion comes from a term known as “camouflaging” or “masking.” “This is the idea that you have to really hide different facets of yourself or different behaviors in order to fit in what you think the expectations around you are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while we all do this at times, the degree that autistic people have to camouflage aspects of themselves may result&lt;s&gt;s&lt;/s&gt; in a feeling of total drainage where afterward they report spending long periods of time alone or in dark and quiet places to recover, Bal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tessers added that, from the outside, people have no idea when someone is camouflaging. “T&lt;span&gt;hey’re doing what everybody wants or expects of them to some successful degree.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This could look like behaving as you “should” at work but going home and crashing and dreading the idea of having to do this camouflaging all over again tomorrow, Tessers noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jordan Siemens via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jordan Siemens via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;It's not uncommon for an adult with autism to need time alone after days filled with social commitments.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Intense Interests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A deep curiosity and passion for one particular &lt;span&gt;activity&lt;/span&gt; or subject can also develop. “Our brains tend to gravitate with a lot of passion towards our area of interest and we become very invested in them and it’s also a way we self-soothe,” Neff said. &lt;/span&gt;This could mean building a career around a specific interest or knowing everything about a specific hobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while everyone has interests — and many people have strong interests — Neff said autistic folks likely find a way to relate everything to their specific interest. For example, this could look like finding a way to talk about a favorite TV show even when the conversation revolves around current events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Allistic people can have a special interest but then it doesn’t become their lens for their whole world,” Neff said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Dislike Of Small Talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t love small talk, but for people with autism, small talk can feel totally exhausting or something that shouldn’t have to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“They typically don’t enjoy small talk and perhaps found ways to avoid it,” Neff said. “Maybe they structured their life or their career in a way that they don’t have to do a lot of that allistic communication.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardner-Wright added that people who are on the spectrum tend to prefer deep, meaningful conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Desire For Direct Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People with autism thrive on straightforwardness, with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; “really honest, clear communication being a strong preference,” Gardner-Wright said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neff said autistic people tend to be pretty literal. For example, when you say the phrase “it’s raining cats and dogs,” she said autistic people may picture literal cats and dogs falling from the sky in their mind, but then realize the person speaking is referring to rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So, actually, I think it’s perhaps more precise to say we’re visual in our communication style versus literal, but it often shows up as being literal,” Neff said. &lt;/span&gt;Additionally, the communication style can be described as direct and honest. “W&lt;span&gt;hat we say, we tend to say at face value,” Neff added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you think you have these signs, look to autistic voices for guidance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Gardner-Wright and Neff recommend exploring the hashtag&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/actuallyautistic/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" #actuallyautistic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/actuallyautistic/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt; #actuallyautistic&lt;/a&gt; on social media to listen to lived experiences and hear from people in your specific community about how this exists for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Discovering that you’re autistic as an adult can be really validating,” Gardner-Wright said. It can help you more fully understand yourself and your life. “But there can also be a grieving process for that,” she said, where you may wish you had this information when you were a kid so certain situations could have been different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Feeling a mix of grief and also excitement is very, very normal,” Gardner-Wright said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://embrace-autism.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="embrace-autism.com" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68013c24e4b0b87197a6e18d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://embrace-autism.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;embrace-autism.com&lt;/a&gt; is a helpful resource for free screening tools and tests to help you understand if you are autistic — though it is not diagnostic, they’re simply online guides to help arm you with information, Gardner-Wright noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can reach out to mental health professionals, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neff said it can be helpful to connect with a therapist to talk about this new discovery, but she stressed that it’s important to find one who is neurodivergent-affirming or -informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bal agreed and said “we have a long way to go with respect to training medical professionals and mental health professionals about autism. I worry there’s a lot of misinformation and misconceptions out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bal added that you can also look up autism centers near you for diagnosis or treatment, but noted that many have a yearslong waitlist and may focus only on children. If they can’t fit you in, Bal said, you can ask if they have resources they recommend, or look for community autism organizations to see if they have any resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fewer than 10% of U.S. adults get the 28 to 34 grams of fiber we need each day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oatmeal is a great start, but there are fruits with even more fiber than oatmeal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These include avocados, blackberries, raspberries, pears and pomegranates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Almost all of us could use more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;. Even though we’re supposed to consume 28 to 34 grams of fiber a day, fewer than 1 in 10 of us actually do it (yikes!).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That doesn’t just spell trouble for our digestive health. Fiber also helps protect against weight gain and can help reduce the risk of a long list of chronic illnesses, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, whole grains like oatmeal can help. For instance, a half-cup of dry oats provides 4 grams of fiber. But did you know that some fruits contain even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; fiber than a bowl of oatmeal?&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, fruit is jammed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. If you’re wondering how much fruit you should eat, the USDA recommends roughly 2 cups per day for women and 2½ cups for men (if you’re a fan of dried fruit, ½ cup of dried fruit equals 1 cup of fresh).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, keep eating that oatmeal. But load your shopping cart with these fiber-rich fruits, too!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 avocado = 10 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may think of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026117/avocados-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;avocados&lt;/a&gt; as a vegetable, but they’re actually a fruit. Green silky avocados are so versatile and delicious that you can use them in almost all kinds of recipes, from salads to smoothies to guacamole and more. No wonder they’re so popular! Between 2000 and 2020, global avocado consumption tripled from 6 billion pounds to 18 billion pounds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Healthwise, avocados may be best known for their heart-friendly fats. But their fiber may be equally as important for your health, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, research reveals avocados’ fiber may encourage the growth of good gut bacteria. This, in turn, may lead to the production of compounds called short-chain fatty acids that nourish your gut and protect it from inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 cup =  8 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All berries are loaded with fiber, but blackberries are off the charts. That’s not the only reason to love them, though. Blackberries are also chock-full of nutrients and health-promoting compounds, including antioxidants such as anthocyanins, ellagitannins, flavonols and flavanols.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These powerful compounds help disable disease-causing free radicals linked to illnesses like heart disease and cancer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, blackberries’ ample vitamin C (roughly a third of your daily requirement per cup) provides even more antioxidant action. Blackberries’ vitamin C also happens to enhance iron absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  So, adding a giant handful of blackberries to your oatmeal can help you soak up more of its iron and give you a fiber bump in the process.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 cup = 8 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like blackberries,&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7835832/health-benefits-of-raspberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; raspberries&lt;/a&gt; are among the highest-fiber fruits. They’re also loaded with protective anthocyanins, flavanols, flavonols and ellagitannins. Combined, these may have potent disease-preventing properties. Consider the findings of one study that focused on the impact of raspberry consumption on diabetes and prediabetes. Researchers concluded that eating 1 to 1½ cups of raspberries daily may have beneficial effects on blood glucose, insulin and cholesterol in people at risk for chronic disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 medium pear = 6 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apples may be a quick, convenient, grab-on-the-go fruit. But don’t forget about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292095/4-surprising-health-benefits-of-pears/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pears&lt;/a&gt;. One pear delivers roughly 20% of the Daily Value for fiber. That’s 30% more than the roughly 4 grams of fiber in the average apple.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  And if constipation is an issue, pears can provide a natural solution. These sweet, juicy fruits are rich in sorbitol, a sugar alcohol that has a natural laxative effect.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 cup pomegranate = 7 grams fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These juicy, ruby-red fruits may resemble apples from the outside, but they’re actually giant berries. While their thick, inedible skin is a no-go, their fleshy arils (which are botanically considered a whole grain, by the way) are packed with fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Like their berry cousins, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882893/health-benefits-of-pomegranates/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pomegranates&lt;/a&gt; are nutrition powerhouses. They’re rich in phytochemicals, including anthocyanins, tannins and flavonoids, which have been shown to exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties and protect against heart disease. Research also reveals pomegranates contain compounds called polyphenols that help promote the growth of healthy gut bacteria, so they’re a win for gut health, too.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber has many health benefits, from keeping you full and satisfied to stabilizing blood sugar levels to lowering cholesterol and more. Of course, whole grains like oatmeal are a great way to score more of this under-consumed nutrient. However, some fruits contain even more fiber than a bowl of oatmeal, especially avocados, blackberries, raspberries and pomegranates. So, head to the produce section and load up. And if you can’t find your favorite fruits in season, don’t forget the freezer section, where you’ll find almost all of the fruits on this list, even avocados!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the reason for these changes is that, as people get closer to the age that “old” starts, they want to keep pushing it down the road? “True, but being ‘old’ isn’t only to do with how many years you’ve been alive, it also depends on your health,” he says. “If you’ve had a stroke or &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/gardened-my-way-through-grief-then-cancer-struck/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, or have &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/midlife-medications-dementia/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; or are otherwise immobile, you will feel older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clough thinks that old age is “often a case of self-definition. At 82, I would define myself as old,” he says. “Maybe I became old when we moved to a retirement village seven years ago, or when I was diagnosed with &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/prostate-cancer-what-you-should-know/"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;.” And yet he hasn’t said goodbye to youth without a struggle. “If someone tells me I look younger  as happened at the barber’s the other day – I’m still flattered, despite the fact my age gets me a cheaper haircut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then I ask myself: why should I get pleasure at being told I look younger? Why don’t we look at older people as beautiful, as we do with trees? Look at my wizened old hands here, and compare them with the bark of a tree. Why is one beautiful, and not the other?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Learning to manage frailty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clough looks after himself: on a swift walk around the Peaks near his home, he leaves this writer panting to keep up. “I do this walk four times a week, go to the gym, and I play tennis when my back allows, though my children are always begging me not to go for the tricky drop shots,” he says. “But I recognise that I am not what I was. If you ask someone my age ‘how are you?’ you know you are going to get a long response.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, he agrees, humour in the sound of a bunch of older people sitting around discussing their ailments and medications. “But it’s also quite interesting,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps old age begins when, if we take a tumble, we go from the action being termed “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/how-to-fall-over-safely/"&gt;having a fall&lt;/a&gt;”, rather than merely “falling over”, which is what young people do. “Yes, there is definitely a difference here,” he says. “‘Having a fall’ feels like something is being done to you; I am out of control of my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know I am frail,” he continues. “I’m vulnerable and not as stable as I used to be. I know that when I’m out walking I need, as Ann keeps reminding me, to ‘keep away from the edge’. I’m learning to take more care, because one false step could immobilise me. I’m trying to keep a foothold; it’s a bit of an analogy for my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wants to try the Three Peaks Challenge again. “But I will be kind to myself if I don’t complete it,” he adds. “I’d love to go over old ground, but if it’s not to be, it’s not to be. I wouldn’t be a failure. I won’t berate myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Accept your memory is failing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However much we want to stress the ability and wisdom of older people, there is a hinterland of diminishing competence,” says Clough. He tells a story of trying to make himself a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/health-benefits-black-coffee/"&gt;cup of coffee&lt;/a&gt;, filling the cafetière with boiling water, but omitting the granules. “I’m sitting there with a cup of hot water, thinking: do I tell Ann?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clough then relates a recent incident where he was having trouble reversing his car in a tight spot, and was happy for his son to take over. He compares this with earlier competence, driving his family in a rickety truck in Namibia. “I’m now aware of my uncertainty, after a lifetime beavering away over decision-making,” he says. “These days I want my children to decide things for me (at least, I think I do).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only thing I have learnt is that I have to accept this is how it is,” he continues. He and his friends laugh about their loss of executive function: “But &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/mental-health/health-benefits-laughter/"&gt;the laughter&lt;/a&gt; is uncertain because it could be early stage dementia. Laughter is a way of dealing with anxiety and fear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Learning from his father’s old age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last few years of his life, Clough’s father went to live in a care home. “In the home, he became very secluded,” Clough remembers. “Dad was a Methodist minister, he was used to holding court. He would just about go down to meals, but I was surprised about how much he stayed in his room: he never went into the garden, or onto walks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Clough tried to encourage his father out of his shell, but then he changed his mind. “Maybe we are imposing a pattern on older people that isn’t naturally there,” he says. “I gradually realised my father was finding a way to come to terms with himself. By this stage, he has already been living without my mother for 14 or 15 years. After he died, I found notes in his bible, about his favourite hymns, TV programmes and articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe my father wanted to use these final months to talk to himself and reflect – to know what was important to him, not other people – and to move towards it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Are we trying too hard to stay ‘young’? Maybe it’s time for acceptance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a strong move in society to almost think we can get away without ageing as long as we eat the right food, take the right supplements, go to the gym, and just keep going,” says Clough. He sees this as a new kind of ageism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t accept a stage of life where our body is going to be different,” he says. “You think this gung-ho lifestyle will keep you going, but what happens when you have a heart attack? It’s really important how you come to terms with this life-stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, instead, you can make the decision to use this time to ‘come home’, to live and let go, and to know you aren’t going to be around forever.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clough feels the writing of &lt;em&gt;Oldenland &lt;/em&gt;has helped prepare him to carve out and create the last period of his life. “Ageing is an important time of life for living, not necessarily ‘doing’ or ‘accomplishing’ or going around the world,” he says. “It’s not about ‘success’. It’s a time to live to the full with who and what I am, alongside the realisation I am not going to go on forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Old age isn’t just about problems with your bladder or your bowels or your hearing – it can be a time to really &lt;em&gt;live.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oldenland: A Journey in Search of the Good Last Years&lt;/em&gt; by Roger Clough is published on 24 April 2025&lt;/p&gt;

The majority of cases are in West Texas, where an outbreak that shows no signs of abating began in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly all of the cases are among people who haven’t been vaccinated, but 3% of the identified cases are so-called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;breakthrough infections.&lt;/a&gt; People got sick despite being either partially or fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Infectious diseases doctors are at pains to emphasize that the MMR vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines on the market, but as Rodney Rohde, a professor at Texas State University explains, a small number of people who are fully vaccinated may get sick during a large outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective at preventing measles, with the second dose increasing that to 97%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The vaccine is highly effective,” said Rohde. “But it means that after two doses, while 97 out of 100 people will develop strong immunity and be protected if exposed to measles, the remaining three out of 100 could still be vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The latest outbreak has seen claims circulating on social media from people who say they are fully vaccinated and still contracted a breakthrough infection, making them seriously unwell, something Rohde said is “slightly possible.” “They could fall into one of those small percentages that got the full vaccine but just didn’t respond,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, he said, it’s also plausible that those people may not have realized they weren’t fully vaccinated against measles. &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/80/3/663/7756619" target="_blank"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that when breakthrough infections occur, the MMR vaccine still tends to provide some partial protection. “If someone vaccinated does get measles, it’s often a milder version, sometimes called modified measles,” says Rohde. “A rash can still occur, but it may be less widespread [across the body], fainter or atypical, meaning it doesn’t follow the classic pattern of starting at the hairline and spreading downwards. Fever is also less common or lower-grade. In classic measles, fevers can spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, but in modified cases, it’s often milder or absent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to Rohde, the same is true for other common measles symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conjunctivitis, or red eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They may still occur, but are often less intense,” he says. “Koplik spots, which are tiny white spots in the mouth, are less commonly seen. Breakthrough cases are also generally less contagious, but still a potential source of transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People are contagious four days before and four days after the rash begins, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services. &lt;/a&gt;The rash usually appears 14 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Rohde also suggests that people experiencing severe symptoms from a breakthrough infection may have just had a single vaccine dose, which still offers significant protection, but not quite as much as the full two-dose regimen. “These cases can be closer to classic measles than in two-dose breakthroughs, with a high fever which may last longer,” he says. “The rash is usually a more typical measles rash and can be more extensive than in fully vaccinated breakthrough cases. They are also more likely to get possible complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s still the question of why these infections happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As Rohde and others explain, there may be a number of reasons, ranging from the timing of vaccination to genetic variability in the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles vaccine immunity is mostly stable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called for the public to get vaccinated against measles, he also claimed in an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2U0csKvqMY" target="_blank"&gt;interview with CBS News&lt;/a&gt; that “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank"&gt;the vaccine wanes very quickly.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Vaccine experts counter that the MMR shots offer lifelong protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“If immunity waned a lot, you would see a lot of cases in vaccinated people in older age groups, and we’re not seeing that in this Texas outbreak or any others in the recent past,” said Scott Weaver, a microbiology and immunology professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who also works with the Global Virus Network coalition of experts. “People seem to be solidly protected, and almost everybody for life, as far as we can tell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Unlike influenza or Covid, measles is a very stable virus that has evolved little to evade vaccine-induced immunity over time. In 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00041-0" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic researchers&lt;/a&gt; published a study concluding that there’s a near-zero probability of a novel measles virus naturally emerging with the capability of circumventing the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While the virus isn’t changing, it appears that in some rare cases, the body’s own immune system can slowly stop producing antibodies against the virus. Based on international studies, scientists have concluded that it is possible for some children &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31184979/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccinated against measles&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35927136/" target="_blank"&gt;lose their protection &lt;/a&gt;over the course of two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Because measles is highly infectious, this waning is expected to cause some breakthrough infections,” said Alexis Robert, a researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who authored a paper on &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00181-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;long-term vaccine protection&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;All people respond to either vaccines or natural infections a little bit differently, according to Weaver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The MMR vaccine, which works by presenting the immune system with a live but weakened version of the measles virus, trains the body’s immune cells to recognize different parts of the virus’ proteins called epitopes and generate antibodies against them in the future, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;An epitope refers to small segments of amino acids on a protein’s structure that the immune system’s antibodies learn to recognize and bind to, should the virus attempt to invade again in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s not unexpected that a few people respond poorly to any vaccine, Weaver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Some people have a very robust response because they respond to many different [viral] epitopes, and some people, just by chance, have immune cells that can’t recognize as many of those epitopes,” he said. “Differences in our genetic makeup determine how many different epitopes we respond to and develop immune memory against.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ousted-fda-vaccine-chief-us-measles-elimination-status-threat-rcna199966" target="_blank"&gt;measles was declared eliminated in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 and no longer considered a public health threat, research into the virus slowed. With vaccine hesitancy rising and the U.S. close to losing its measles elimination status, some scientists see the need to study and monitor the rare cases of breakthrough infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“While transmission patterns show measles outbreaks are driven by groups of unvaccinated individuals, especially among children, a potential risk of infection years after vaccination still impacts what strategy is most effective and the coverage needed to eradicate measles,” Robert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How quickly does the measles vaccine take effect?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Timing can also make a difference. A child who had just received the MMR vaccine will still be vulnerable to measles within the first couple of weeks, especially during an intense outbreak where a lot of virus is circulating, Rohde said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“In most cases, the human immune system takes roughly two weeks to develop enough protection against the measles virus and many other pathogens,” he said. “If you were exposed just before or after getting the vaccine, your body may not be at full strength.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In some cases, for example people who are either born with a weakened immune system or develop conditions such as autoimmune diseases or blood cancers, the body may not mount as effective an immune response against measles, resulting in breakthrough infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There are people who just have an overall immune system that’s just not as effective against many different infectious agents,” Weaver said. “We know about people who are immune compromised for certain reasons, like they’re HIV-infected, they’re under chemotherapy for cancer, things like that, but there are some people who are just born with immune systems that don’t function quite as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Another plausible explanation is that people may have received a defective MMR vaccine, although Weaver said this is unlikely in the United States, where quality controls tend to be fairly stringent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“In the cases of measles, it’s a live virus, so that virus could become less infectious if it’s not stored properly and that could lead to less [immune] response,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;When you might need a measles booster&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Whether you’re more vulnerable to developing a breakthrough measles infection could also depend on when you were born. Before the first measles vaccines were developed in the 1960s, virtually everyone contracted the virus during childhood, providing those who survived with lifelong immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, people who were born between 1957 and 1968 received a first-generation measles vaccine made using an inactivated virus that did not work so well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone born within this time frame should get at least one MMR dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Between 1968 and 1989, most people received only a single MMR dose, making them slightly less well protected compared with people who got the standard two doses in the past 36 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, suggested that if someone who got only a single dose is near a current measles outbreak or is traveling internationally to a country where the virus is endemic, it could be worth checking with with a doctor about getting another dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Even if you’re truly immune and you get another dose of MMR, there’s no harm to that,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPeGpRZnY2Zjd4ZWJKLXR1dHJSbnVWTEp2UVptNE1zYWIxQkotR3ZPcURVbFRMd3o1dVF0RXN3emM4YnRpVWtDSXE0YmZMWm9wQTlqREhjU0pXZUVaTkg1T0Fyb1RmbVB0ZHh2a0JsY1pjRFJ3TEFBcXpYdEtsLV9GUG5wUU5MbWlEbnZPZjRmWlFxQlFQTjlvVmtqQzkzN3A1V2JYdmR2c3dvMV9PcHfSAVZBVV95cUxPSlVhS0o2MHNsQzJnMllKMWZoeVJuT1cwVy1kWEwxU241VW1vZ01vbFpqWjRDQkxSQlo3Z3l3b3JPV2lpRV96T1hQX3RqOEd0dTBoTllkdw</guid></item><item><title>今天的杂草非常强大。但这不是你应该担心的。-石板 | Today’s Weed Is Incredibly Strong.

You reach that tipping point where your high turns from mellow to paranoid, and all of a sudden you’re stumbling uncontrollably down a rabbit hole of terrifying thoughts which all lead to the conclusion that the world is ending. Nobody likes how it feels.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhi001j3b73exvzte9m@published"&gt;Ever since recreational cannabis became legal, the risks of overconsuming have raised debates about potency. (Remember Maureen Dowd’s 2014 &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27704837"&gt;hotel room freak-out&lt;/a&gt;?) That panic has returned with force in recent months, as cannabis has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/26/nx-s1-4977448/americans-report-using-marijuana-more-frequently-than-alcohol-what-are-the-risks-of-both"&gt;become more popular than ever&lt;/a&gt;, and dispensaries are advertising ever more potent products. Earlier this year, the New York Times blasted the cannabis industry for fighting bills that limit potency. Such laws have been proposed around the country, including in &lt;a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/A977#:~:text=2025%2DA977%20(ACTIVE)%20%2D%20Summary,other%20cannabis%20or%20hemp%20products."&gt;New York &lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_076_01.pdf"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; (where it applies only to people under 25), and &lt;a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/438/BillText/c1/PDF"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and would put caps on THC flower potency between 0.3 and 15 percent. (Commercially available cannabis usually contains at least 20 percent THC.)&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhi001k3b73iqlpkb6l@published"&gt;The problem is that lawmakers and the media alike deeply misunderstand how cannabis potency actually works. Peter Grinspoon, a physician, Harvard Medical School instructor, and author of &lt;em&gt;Seeing Through the Smoke,&lt;/em&gt; on medical cannabis, told Slate that limits on the simple percentage of THC in cannabis products could actually hurt medical patients for a number of reasons. People adjust their doses based on the strength of a product—so if they’re smoking a product that’s half as strong, for example, they might end up smoking twice as much, doing further damage to their lungs. Studies &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93198-5.epdf"&gt;have shown&lt;/a&gt; that consumers will naturally use less when the product is stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhj001l3b73i5lml0sd@published"&gt;“When I was growing up, one of the arguments against cannabis was that it was so weak, you had to smoke so much, and it was bad for your lungs,” Grinspoon said. “Now it’s stronger. And the argument is it’s so dangerous because it’s so potent.” On top of potential lung damage, Grinspoon says that weakening potency will simply make cannabis more expensive for medical patients, and “twice as expensive for people on fixed incomes, like veterans and older people.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhj001m3b737jrr7j54@published"&gt;Existing and past laws limiting cannabis potency are misguided not just because they might actually lead people to consume more, but because they’re written in a way that fails to understand the complexity of cannabis potency, according to Brien Hoffhine, director of cultivation at Loudbird Cannabis in Boulder, Colorado. The misunderstanding originated with the 2018 Farm Bill, which stipulates that cannabis potency should be determined by the percentage of the cannabinoid delta 9 THC—the most well-known intoxicating component of cannabis—in a product.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhk001n3b73ne0kx08l@published"&gt;“They just had no idea how the science actually worked,” Hoffhine told Slate. What the lawmakers misunderstood is that THCA, which is often present in higher quantities than delta 9 THC and which does not influence legal potency levels in the Farm Bill, can convert to delta 9 THC when it’s smoked. On top of that, there are many other cannabinoids in the plant that can make a high more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhk001o3b73vdjvv6cv@published"&gt;Hoffhine admits that consumers gravitate toward high-THC products, and that influences what he grows and sells. He says that if the weekly menu that Loudbird puts out has products with THC levels below 20 percent, they won’t get any orders.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhk001p3b734gvo1iml@published"&gt;But the percentages listed on product labels and menus don’t tell the whole truth. THC potency is determined through mandatory lab testing. But, Hoffhine explained, labs can return dramatically different results for the same plant. It’s an open secret in the industry that brands will shop around labs to get the highest potency result, and multiple studies &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282396"&gt;have shown&lt;/a&gt; that potency labels on products are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10096267/#:~:text=%5B18%5D%20evaluated%2014%2C234%20samples%20of,retail%20(21.5%25%20%C2%B16.0)"&gt;usually inflated&lt;/a&gt;. So when the New York Times reports that a certain brand is selling the most potent weed around, they might inadvertently be promoting the brand’s dubious marketing claims.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhk001q3b73dc9ti4x1@published"&gt;Masha Ty, who works for ACS Laboratory, which tests cannabis products in Florida, told Slate that her lab has lost clients because they refused to inflate their THC numbers. “We don’t give them the high numbers that they want to see, so they leave,” Ty said. “It’s bad, right? But we’re under NDA. We can’t really call them out.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhl001r3b730pbp2zx6@published"&gt;Ty emphasizes that, unlike alcohol, cannabis potency is influenced by multiple components, and varies quite a bit based on the individual consumer. There are at least 118 cannabinoids in the plant that go beyond the well-known THC and CBD, and they all interact with one another to produce different kinds of highs. Different individuals, too, have different endocannabinoid systems, which will affect their response to different products. Terpenes, which exist in all plants, can also contribute to the quality of the high. These compounds help “steer” the experience, Ty explained, because they can make it focused, relaxing, or uplifting.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhl001s3b737o0znfu8@published"&gt;Newer to the market are THC distillates and concentrates, which can contain up to 95 percent THC. These products are more potent in some ways, but they also provide a more one-dimensional experience, because they only contain THC.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhm001t3b73xbwk6esx@published"&gt;Grinspoon is concerned about how the market has gravitated toward high-THC cannabis. “I think we fetishize high THC, and we could do a lot better with lower THC,” he said, adding that CBD can mitigate some of the addictive qualities of cannabis, and other cannabinoids have more medical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

To fix this, they want better research and education about all of the components of cannabis and how they affect different people differently.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhm001v3b735l0ewtji@published"&gt;For example, if people understood the science behind cannabis edibles, they’d know why some people simply aren’t affected by them , no matter how potent they are. “Some people don’t even process it,” Ty explained. “So they eat gummies and nothing will happen to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="25" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9muayhm001w3b73luqvyqxq@published"&gt;It’s just one example of how deeply complicated cannabis potency is. Until lawmakers learn to understand it, they have no hope of effectively regulating &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

People are different, and we can see those differences in skin pigmentation, in hair colour and texture and in other physical characteristics. These differences cluster in locations around the world: people from the same region on average look more similar to each other than to people from other areas – so far, so obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the 18th Century, these traits were the primary determinants for a new fashion for categorising humans in supposedly scientific terms. The Swedish botanist &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.linnean.org/learning/who-was-linnaeus/career-and-legacy" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Karl Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt; is legitimately credited as the father of modern biology, as he gave us &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/sounds/play/m001l291" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the classification system we still use today&lt;/a&gt;: genus and species. Every living thing is named according to this system, for example the bacteria &lt;i id="escherichia-coli" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, or the lion, &lt;i id="panthera-leo" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Panthera leo&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i id="gorilla-gorilla" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Gorilla gorilla&lt;/i&gt;, which probably doesn't need explaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;We are &lt;i id="homo-sapiens" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt; – wise people. But in his foundational work &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/10277#page/7/mode/1up" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="systemae-naturae" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Systemae Naturae&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Linnaeus introduced another &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.linnean.org/learning/who-was-linnaeus/linnaeus-and-race" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;tier of classification for us&lt;/a&gt;, designated primarily by that most visible of human traits: pigmentation. Linnaeus gave us four types of human, lumped together by continental landmasses: &lt;i id="asiaticus" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Asiaticus&lt;/i&gt; – people with "yellow skin", and straight black hair; &lt;i id="americanus" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Americanus&lt;/i&gt; – indigenous Americans, with "red skin" also with straight black hair; &lt;i id="africanus" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Africanus&lt;/i&gt; – "black skinned" people with tight curls in their hair; and &lt;i id="europeaus" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Europeaus&lt;/i&gt; – "white skinned" with blue eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Introducing a classification system for humans that is ludicrous, racist and most importantly, hierarchical, would leave an indelible mark on the centuries that followed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;These designations are clearly absurd – none of the colours are accurate, even if you took the obviously incorrect view that millions of people share the same skin tones even within those categories. But the roots of the race designations we still use today are visible in these labels. Some of these terms have fallen out of social acceptability and are considered racist. But we still use "black" and "white" as descriptors for millions of people, none of whom really have either black or white skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Even if this colour scheme were true, Linnaeus' original descriptions only began with physical traits. What he included in later editions of &lt;i id="systemae-naturae" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Systemae Naturae&lt;/i&gt;, which became the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.linnean.org/learning/who-was-linnaeus/linnaeus-and-race" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;basis for scientific racism&lt;/a&gt;, were portrayals of behaviours. &lt;i id="asiaticus" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Asiaticus&lt;/i&gt; were described as "haughty, greedy and ruled by opinions" while Americanus were labelled "stubborn, zealous, regulated by customs". &lt;i id="africanus" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Africanus&lt;/i&gt; women were denoted as being "without shame" while both sexes were said to be "crafty, lazy, and governed by caprice". He described &lt;i id="europaeus" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Europaeus&lt;/i&gt; as "gentle, acute, inventive, governed by laws".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By any definition in any age, these assertions are racist and entirely incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Of course, in examining history, we must be wary of judging people from the past by our own standards. But as the foundational text of modern biology, introducing a classification system for humans that is ludicrous, racist and most importantly, hierarchical, would leave an indelible mark on the centuries that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l525rt.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images An exhibition at one of the Smithsonian Institution's museums on race has led to intervention from the Trump White House (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;An exhibition at one of the Smithsonian Institution's museums on race has led to intervention from the Trump White House (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Over the next 200 years, many men would seek to refine these categories with new metrics, including pseudoscientific interpretations of craniometry, or skull measurements. They never settled on a definitive answer about how many races there are – none of the characteristics that were being used are immutable, nor exclusive to the people to whom they were supposedly essential. We call this ideology "racial essentialism". But all of the many schemes put white Europeans as superior to all others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was biologist Charles Darwin who first began to unpick these ideas, recognising in his 1871 book the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2300" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Descent of Man&lt;/a&gt; that there was much more continuity in traits between people that had been designated as discrete races. By the beginning of the 20th Century, molecular biology had entered the stage, and the era of genetics would dismantle the biological concept of race. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By the time we began to look at how genes are shared in families and populations, we saw that similarities do indeed cluster in groups, but these groupings do not align with the longstanding attempts to classify the races. The true metric of human difference is at a genetic level. In the 20th Century, when we began to unravel our genomes, and observe how people are similar and different in our DNA, we saw that the terms in use for several centuries bore little meaningful relation to the underlying genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Two people from Ethiopia and Namibia will be more different to each other at a genetic level than either one of them is to a white European&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Even though only a tiny percentage of our DNA differs between individuals, the genome is so large and complex that there is great diversity. Geneticists are still working to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230227-the-search-for-the-worlds-missing-genomes" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;unravel how this alters people's health&lt;/a&gt;, for example. But those genetic differences do not delineate along the lines of what we call race. They follow ancestral lines, can differ by &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://popgen.uchicago.edu/ggv/?data=%221000genomes%22&amp;amp;chr=1&amp;amp;pos=222087833" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;geographic location&lt;/a&gt; and can be traced through &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1424033112" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;historic migration patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet, for historical reasons, we continue to refer to both Ethiopians and Namibians under the race definition of "black". Or take African Americans, people largely descended from enslaved Africans brought to the New World: sequencing the genomes of Black Americans reveals echoes of the history of transatlantic slavery. They not only mixed genetic ancestry from the handful of West African countries from which their ancestors were taken, but also significant amounts of White European DNA. This reflects the fact that slave owners had sexual relationships – many of which would not have been consensual – with enslaved people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Therefore, the simple categorisation of descendants of the enslaved as "black" similarly does not make biological sense. They are genetically diverse in themselves and different from the African ancestors from which they are descended. To lump them together makes no scientific sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So it is by consensus, usage and history that we continue to use the term "black". This is what we mean by a social construct. The concept of race has little utility as a biological taxonomy. But it is enormously important socially and culturally. Social constructs are how the world works: money and time are both socially constructed too. The value of a pound or dollar is applied by agreement against goods and services. Time passes unerringly, but hours and minutes are entirely arbitrary units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The media immediately began to search for a reason that reified a biological version of race, sometimes focusing on vitamin D metabolism, which is connected with melanin production, and has effects on viral infections. Some studies showed that lower levels of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2777682" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vitamin D did associate with susceptibility to covid infection&lt;/a&gt; among black people. But this is a correlation not a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is why genetics has played such an important role in the dismantling of a scientific justification of race and understanding racism itself. And it's why the latest statement from Trump's White House is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/arts/design/trump-smithsonian-race.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;troubling many in the scientific community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Trump frequently speaks about aspects of genetics to make political points. One view that he has expressed repeatedly is that some people, and predictably himself, are genetically superior. "You have good genes, you know that, right?" he said in September 2020 to a rally in Minnesota – a state that is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/bemidjicityminnesota" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;more than 80% white&lt;/a&gt;. "You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn't it, don't you believe? You have good genes in Minnesota."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Similarly, in the successful 2024 campaign, he &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/ckg0xk3dw55t?post=asset%3A2975891e-69db-431a-aead-2c8217cf871e#post" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;denounced immigrants as having "bad genes"&lt;/a&gt;. It's hard for someone who studies genes – and the strange and sometimes troubling history of genetics – to understand even what might constitute a "bad" or "good" gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ours may be a pernicious history, but the trajectory of genetics has been one that tends towards progress, and equity for all, as enshrined in the Declaration of Independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 09:00:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPV1BJazRjLVdPSGh6M1FvT0pmX0N0N2k4SVFlZXk5UFA4Ni1acDlxZnJ5TndyZ0RjVWVSZnZVWnZ3aGJIM1laT3RzWUprVjhDUVZCcUNXakJEWlZvU3hxbEt6bEM3VUFCdFJpSmpwcmZobF9CQVZ3alBzOGtuTGRzLW9rZ1FnTmVXTjRSS3JRZUVVSzVWejlvNkpIMXlMdFZyallN</guid></item><item><title>控制胆固醇水平的8种饮食习惯-印度时报 | 8 diet practices to control cholesterol level -

It’s much more serious than a cosmetic concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to top doctors and nutritionists across India, a pot belly is a visible sign of a much deeper health risk—one that affects your heart, liver, hormones, and even mental health. And the worst part? It sneaks up gradually, often starting as early as your teens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s break it all down—what causes a pot belly, why it’s dangerous, and how you can tackle it before it turns into a full-blown health hazard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Apurva Shah, Consultant, Gastroenterology at Apollo Hospitals, Ahmedabad, defines a pot belly as an accumulation of abdominal fat, especially the dangerous kind called visceral fat. This fat wraps around your internal organs and messes with how your body functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just “extra weight.” It’s a health red flag linked to heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, fatty liver disease, and in serious cases? It can spiral into heart attacks, liver failure, and even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shah points out that while belly fat is usually seen in adulthood, its roots often begin in adolescence. Think processed snacks, too much screen time, no exercise—sound familiar? These patterns settle in your body and lay the groundwork for fat to gather around your belly like an unwanted guest who refuses to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress, sleep &amp;amp; belly fat: The toxic trio&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hemalata Arora, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine at Nanavati Max, says stress and sleep deprivation are two major culprits behind a growing waistline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re stressed, your body pumps out cortisol—a hormone that’s meant to help in short bursts. But chronic stress keeps cortisol levels high, which tells your body to store fat—right around the belly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add poor sleep to the mix, and it’s a recipe for disaster. You overeat (especially junk), your metabolism slows down and hormonal imbalance triggers more fat storage. So if you’re pulling all-nighters or constantly feeling wired and tired, your belly is paying the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why fat heads straight to your stomach&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk hormones and aging. As we grow older, our metabolism naturally slows down, and we burn fewer calories even when resting. That alone is enough to cause gradual fat gain. Dr. Arora explains that belly fat cells have more receptors for cortisol, making your tummy a hotspot for stress-related weight. Combine that with age-related drops in muscle mass, and you've got a situation where fat starts piling up—especially in the midsection. Also, thanks to our modern, carb-heavy diets, insulin resistance kicks in. This makes it easier for sugar to convert to fat, and guess where the body loves to store it? Yep, the belly again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diet is the ultimate game changer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitian Karuna Chaturvedi from Max Super Speciality Hospital says cutting belly fat starts with mindful eating and controlling calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Load up on greens &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat fibre-rich berries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy fats from nuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Omega-3 rich fish &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complex carbs &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what to avoid? Sweets, deep-fried food, aerated drinks, and anything ultra-processed. These are belly fat’s best friends and your worst enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, drink water, stay active, and sleep like it’s your job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health risks to know&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rajesh Padhan from Marengo Asia Hospitals drops a truth bomb: a pot belly is linked to serious diseases beyond diabetes and heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belly fat increases inflammatory chemicals in your body, elevates blood pressure and cholesterol, interferes with insulin function, fuels non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), boosts risk of cancers like colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer and leads to sleep apnea, hormone issues, and mental health struggles. This kind of fat also plays mind games—lowering self-esteem, increasing anxiety, and dragging down your confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pot belly is a signal&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That belly bulge isn’t just a sign that you overate biryani last weekend. It’s a warning that your body is struggling to keep up with stress, poor habits, and metabolic chaos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can reverse it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With small, consistent changes in food, movement, sleep, and mindset, your belly (and everything else) will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So next time you notice your waistband tightening, don’t reach for the looser pants—reach for a lifestyle shift. Because your health deserves more than just damage control. It deserves a reboot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>犹他大学生物化学家被评为2025年《时代》杂志最具影响力的人物之一- KSL新闻 | University of Utah biochemist named one of Time's most influential people of 2025 - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPLUtpYll1MGtPdHhsSmpwWVRuSFhnZmR0WmlzUkw4empvVThWanZvM0h0T3dDWEhheEsyLUVNUkhIanJEeTE3VmNOVXQ5MkZid1BiNXlHQTRHZjNYalFCYU1NeVdCWlhpd3BSYld5T1hDeGRkMHBkZnd5YUNwbXlXdENQd3k3U1hkNkMxVEhqM01fMHBwNWZNQVVYTXdyalhhWnpic1kxNlBQS0lWSWptVzZvNVNWTEZa?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — What do actress and comedian Kristen Wiig, President Donald Trump, journalist David Muir and a University of Utah biochemistry professor have in common? They were all listed among &lt;a href="https://time.com/collections/100-most-influential-people-2025/7273749/tomas-cihlar-and-wesley-sundquist/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Time magazine's 100&lt;/a&gt; most influential people in the world on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wesley Sundquist, co-chairman of the Department of Biochemistry at the U., is being recognized with his co-recipient, Tomas Cihlar, a virologist for Gilead Sciences, for their work that led to a first-of-its-kind HIV treatment and prevention drug lenacapavir. Time magazine recognized the pair for their decades of work that led to what scientific journal Science called &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2024#section_breakthrough" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Breakthrough of the Year&lt;/a&gt; in 2024: a twice-a-year injectable that has shown a nearly 100% efficacy rate in preventing HIV infection for at-risk individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was completely surprised when I got the call," said Sundquist, "but I feel like I'm representing a lot of people who have worked hard on this project ... so it was great (news)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundquist and his biochemistry lab were responsible for their work studying HIV capsids — the protein shell responsible for protecting and releasing the virus' genetic material — in the late '90s. They began by studying how HIV is built on a molecular level. They discovered that the capsid's structure is extremely sensitive, making it an ideal target for disrupting the virus' ability to infect human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery was passed on to collaborators like Cihlar at biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, who began researching drugs that targeted the HIV capsid. This eventually led to Gilead developing and manufacturing lenacapavir, known as its brand name &lt;a href="https://www.sunlenca.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Sunleca.&lt;/a&gt; Similar HIV treatment drugs are taken as a daily pill and work by targeting the virus after it enters the cell, but lenacapavir is a long-acting treatment that only requires an injection every six months and interferes with the infection process at an earlier stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundquist followed the drug's development as a consultant through the years. He says his research began as a way to contribute to the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was doing a (postdoctoral program) in Cambridge, England, and then typically you're hired to run your own lab, and you have to decide what the lab should work on," said Sunquist. "That was during the time when the death rate from HIV/AIDS was rising dramatically in the U.S., and there wasn't a clear end in sight. So the science interested me, but it was also clearly going to be a very important medical problem that needed lots of perspectives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death rate from AIDS, the most advanced stage of HIV, has reduced significantly in the U.S. since 1994, when it became the leading cause of death for Americans ages 25 to 44, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/history/hiv-and-aids-timeline#year-1994" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;federal website&lt;/a&gt; for HIV. But it still remains a prevalent issue &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/global-statistics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;around the world&lt;/a&gt;, especially in eastern and southern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilead is working on getting lenacapavir approved to be used as a pre-exposure prophylaxis — or PrEP — to prevent HIV contraction, since it is currently only approved to treat the virus. Clinical trials using the drug as PrEP were conducted in South Africa and Uganda, proving the drug to be successful in preventing HIV infection in almost 100% of at-risk participants, according to &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/us-fda-accepts-gileads-new-drug-applications-for-twice-yearly-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention-under-priority-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Gilead&lt;/a&gt;. The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing the drug applications under priority review and has a target action date of June 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there's every reason to expect that it will be very, very successful. The clinical trials certainly indicate that," said Sundquist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundquist doesn't spend as much time in the lab as he did early on in his career, but he confirmed that the university's biochemists are still working with the HIV capsid and studying other aspects of what viruses can teach scientists about cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Time's list of the most influential people in 2025 only formally recognized Sundquist and Cihlar for their work in HIV treatment and prevention, Sundquist says many others contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Working on hard problems takes time, and it takes support and a lot of people," he said. "I would say the most important contributions were made by graduate students and postdoctoral (students). ...

			&lt;p&gt;What causes  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;? This severe mental illness, which affects &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schizophrenia"&gt;over 20 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and is characterised by recurrent hallucinations and delusions, often begins to emerge in the period from adolescence to early adulthood. It's a complex disorder that affects almost every area of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current theories about why schizophrenia develops &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36370183/"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; it may be linked to changes in brain development during this critical period of emerging adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is also &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/314464"&gt;thought to be similar&lt;/a&gt; to conditions such as dyslexia,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;), which are neurodevelopmental but usually manifest in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EvN7R1oRuOI?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124003585"&gt;our research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that accelerated brain ageing could be another potential driver in the development of schizophrenia – and this can be measured using a simple blood test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study is unique because we measured proteins in blood derived directly from brain neurons – the brain's nerve cells – in people suffering from schizophrenia. This protein, called neurofilament light protein (NfL), consists of long, thread-like structures that help maintain the size and shape of nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NfL is released into the blood and cerebrospinal fluid when brain neurons are damaged or undergo neurodegeneration. Its release when these cells are damaged makes it a &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/14/11624"&gt;useful biomarker&lt;/a&gt; for diagnosing and monitoring neurodegenerative diseases and neurological damage. Measuring the levels of NfL can also provide insight into the extent of neuronal injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal injury is damage or harm to neurons, the specialised cells in the nervous system essential for communication in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. When neurons are injured, their ability to function properly is impaired, which can result in a range of neurological symptoms depending on the severity and location of the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raised levels of NfL have been associated with a range of neurological conditions including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, multiple sclerosis,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease and frontotemporal dementia. But NfL levels also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37511382/"&gt;normally increase with age&lt;/a&gt; as these proteins lose the ability to repair themselves as effectively. This is due to a combination of factors including gradual wear-and-tear on neurons over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reductions in the brain's grey matter, white matter and connectivity are all part of normal, healthy ageing, these changes are usually gradual and not disabling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey matter contains most of the brain's neurons and is responsible for processing information, memory, decision-making, muscle control, and seeing and hearing. White matter is the long fibres that connect different brain regions, allowing them to communicate quickly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noticeable symptoms of normal, healthy brain ageing might include a bit more forgetfulness, slower reaction time, and difficulty juggling multiple tasks. Such changes are very different from the patterns seen in illnesses like schizophrenia where, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/40/5/1140/1924488"&gt;our study shows&lt;/a&gt;, the decline is faster and more severe, indicating an older brain age than would be expected from the patient's chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IIFPUpqS5dc?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research found that, in people with schizophrenia, NfL levels appeared to increase more quickly with age, compared with the rate of increase in healthy people, indicating an acceleration of the brain ageing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also studied samples from people suffering from bipolar disorder, which did not show the same accelerated increase. Data from &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-022-00330-z"&gt;other methods&lt;/a&gt;, such as calculating "brain age" from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans, also points to accelerated brain ageing in people with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people suffering from schizophrenia, accelerated ageing of the body is already a serious problem, as Christos Pantelis, a Melbourne psychiatrist and senior author of our study, explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important problem is that people with chronic schizophrenia are often exposed to an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7796511/#abstract1"&gt;unhealthy lifestyle overall&lt;/a&gt;. They can experience isolation, unemployment, lack of physical activities, smoking – and many resort to illicit drug use that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/cannabis-increased-schizophrenia-risk-in-young-people-linked-to-both-low-and-high-use-175463"&gt;can make their condition worse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, people diagnosed with schizophrenia have &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/10/12/2366"&gt;a life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; 20-30 years shorter than the average. This is mainly due to earlier development of common age-related diseases such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/45/12/987/7611764"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/schizophrenia"&gt;Around half&lt;/a&gt; of people with schizophrenia have at least one other chronic medical condition, such as obesity, respiratory conditions, chronic pain and substance-use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with schizophrenia have &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK571451/"&gt;a higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of substance-use disorders due to a combination of biological, psychological and environmental factors. These include self-medication for distressing symptoms, impaired cognitive function, social isolation, and difficulties with treatment adherence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lifestyle is a factor in the accelerated ageing of the body for those living with schizophrenia, our study could prove another important step in understanding – and in time, treating – this distressing disease.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/239979/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

The drugs also had the added benefit of keeping them quiet. They didn’t necessarily need to take the tablets at weekends or during the holidays – the aim was to improve their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs were also viewed as a temporary fix. The children might take them for a few months or a couple of years, but as they aged and their behaviour improved, they would stop taking them – usually by the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, today this has all changed. The number of children diagnosed with ADHD has surged, with diagnoses for boys doubling since 2000, and tripling for girls over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There has also been a sea change in how the condition is understood. No longer is it viewed as a temporary behaviour issue, but as a lifelong condition which requires constant, often daily, medical treatment for years, if not for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Joanna Moncrieff began her career as an NHS psychiatrist more than 30 years ago, and says she has grown more concerned about the number of children on stimulant pills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Studies now show that ADHD stimulants do not help children perform better in school&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, nearly 250,000 people in England received ADHD prescriptions on the NHS – a more than threefold rise from 81,000 in 2015. Of those, more than 60,000 are children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I am not a child psychiatrist, but I have spent my career doing research into drug treatments for all sorts of mental health problems. And over the years I have grown increasingly concerned about the number of children on these stimulant pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the main problems is that children do not like taking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A US study, which asked children on stimulants how the pills made them feel, found they regularly described the drugs making them feel ‘numb’ or ‘sad’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some described how, while on stimulants, they ‘don’t smile’ or ‘feel like myself’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then there are the physical consequences to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another US study found that children on stimulants were, on average, 1.5in (4cm) shorter than their peers who also had ADHD but were not taking the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite these side-effects, many psychiatrists who prescribe the tablets – both on the NHS and privately – say those consequences are a necessary evil. This is because, they argue, the pills help children perform better in school and, ultimately, have brighter futures as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, growing research has thrown this justification into question. Studies now show that ADHD stimulants do not help children perform better in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is why I, and an increasing number of my colleagues, believe we need to think again about the rising use of these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So how did we get here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS defines ADHD as a condition where the brain works differently to most people. Children diagnosed with it are often those who have trouble concentrating or sitting still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-91c5cc20-1d25-11f0-b008-49fe5fdecb05" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14627875/children-ADHD-drugs-stunt-growth-psychiatrist-Joanna-Moncrieff.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;What is ADHD?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a behavioural condition defined by inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It affects around five per cent of children in the US. Some 3.6 per cent of boys and 0.85 per cent of girls suffer in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms typically appear at an early age and become more noticeable as a child grows. These can also include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Constant fidgeting &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Poor concentration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Excessive movement or talking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Acting without thinking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Inability to deal with stress &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Little or no sense of danger &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Careless mistakes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Mood swings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Forgetfulness &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Difficulty organising tasks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt; Continually starting new tasks before finishing old ones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Inability to listen or carry out instructions &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most cases are diagnosed between six and 12 years old. Adults can also suffer, but there is less research into this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ADHD's exact cause is unclear but is thought to involve genetic mutations that affect a person's brain function and structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Premature babies and those with epilepsy or brain damage are more at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ADHD is also linked to anxiety, depression, insomnia, Tourette's and epilepsy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A combination of medication and therapy is usually recommended to relieve symptoms and make day-to-day life easier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Source: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;NHS Choices &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other common symptoms, according to the Health Service, include being easily distracted, making impulsive decisions and finding it hard to listen to what people are saying or to follow instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This definition of ADHD has long been contested. Many, like myself, point out that you would be hard-pressed to find a child who didn’t show several of these symptoms at one time or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no blood test or scan you can take to get an ADHD diagnosis. So it’s left completely up to the judgment of the doctor to decide whether a patient has it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent research also shows that symptoms fluctuate, meaning children show them at some times and not others. This flies in the face of the idea that ADHD is a lifelong condition originating in a different sort of brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But another contentious issue is the drugs that are used to treat it, which have remained largely the same for nearly 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first research into treating ADHD dates back to 1937, when an American psychiatrist experimented with giving children with behavioural issues a daily dose of the stimulant drug amphetamine (then known as benzedrine).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time the drug was used by factory workers to help them get through long shifts filled with repetitive tasks. Today, the same substance is taken by recreational drug-takers and is better known by its street name, speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the study, which earlier this month was highlighted in The New York Times, concluded that benzedrine had a ‘spectacular’ effect on problem children. According to their teachers, many children showed ‘remarkably improved school performance’ and, overnight, became ‘placid and easygoing’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is this research which has paved the way for millions of prescriptions of these stimulant drugs to be given to children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most popular stimulant to be prescribed to children with ADHD is methylphenidate, also known by its brand name Ritalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in recent years, studies have called into question the benefits of stimulants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One such study, published in 2022, involved children aged seven to 12 attending a two-month summer camp in the US. Half their time was spent doing classroom learning. Researchers randomly split the children into two groups. Half received a daily dose of Ritalin, while the other half were given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While in the classroom, the children taking Ritalin appeared to work faster and were better behaved than those on the placebo. However, at the end of the teaching periods, the two groups underwent tests and the results showed that the children on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ritalin hadn’t learnt any more than their non-drugged campmates. The drugs don’t improve the brain function of ADHD patients, they simply change behaviour temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Teachers and parents see hard-working, quiet children. The children may feel they are doing better too, but as the research shows, the drugs do not improve their performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are also the long-term consequences of these pills to consider. We already know that they can stunt growth, and even delay puberty in boys. There are also worries that, in rare cases, stimulants can damage the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But I am also concerned that stimulants might negatively affect children’s personality development. Children who act out need to learn to be responsible for their actions. If they are told they are sick and can only be normal with the help of medication, they may never learn how to control their own behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, it’s true that many children do have attention problems and struggle in school. The number getting mobile phones has probably only made this issue worse. Some children find a large institution like school difficult. They find the work boring and don’t feel they fit in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often, when children diagnosed with ADHD leave school and find something that interests and motivates them, they do really well. This suggests it’s the environment that’s the problem, not the child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I wouldn’t like to say that no child should ever be prescribed stimulants, but it seems wrong that we are having to give children drugs to enable them to fit into modern-day life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;I hated how these drugs made me feel - but I'd have failed my exams without their help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;It was the summer of 2014, I was deep into A-level revision and my mornings &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;all began the same way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;After breakfast I would take two small, white pills. By the time I had showered, my heart would be beating so fast it felt like it was going to burst out of my chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;But I’d ignore this and sit at my desk, where I’d often stay for four or five hours at a time, not even getting up to go to the toilet or eat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The pills were Ritalin, a stimulant ADHD medication I had been prescribed two years previously. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;As a child I’d been quiet and well-behaved. However, at 14 things changed drastically when my parents’ divorce threw home life into chaos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;I would skip school, argue with teachers and disrupt lessons. When I could be convinced to sit still, my mind wandered and I’d spend more time doodling than doing any work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Six months before my GCSEs (pictured left), I was on course to fail them all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;In desperation, my parents took me to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with ADHD and prescribed Ritalin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The idea was to take them every day, but I quickly found that was impossible. When I took them at school, my concentration on tasks would improve, but I also found it challenging to talk or write essays. It was as though the pills dulled my creativity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;They also made me anxious, and anti-social, and took away my appetite. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;But I discovered the best way to use them: revision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Previously, revising for exams was so boring that I couldn’t manage it. But on Ritalin it became the most fascinating and important task in the world, and I managed to gain decent grades in my exams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;At A-level, being able to pick my subjects meant I’d begun to enjoy school – particularly English. However, feeling the pressure to get the grades &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;I needed for my university of choice, Edinburgh, I turned again to Ritalin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;These revision days passed in a haze, where I was unable to talk or eat very much at all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;However, the tactic paid off. I got top marks and gained a university place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;That was the last time I took Ritalin. It had helped me, but I hated the way it made me feel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The experience also made me realise that it was within my own abilities to sit down and revise. So I decided to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;go drug-free at university.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;More than a decade on, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;I often forget that I was once labelled with ADHD. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;I work long hours and find my job incredibly engaging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;While I’m thankful that the drugs helped get me through exams, I firmly believe my behaviour problems were a temporary issue triggered by what was going on at home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;And, eventually, I simply outgrew that behaviour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 00:24:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQem9aeEVoREJOU3hEUVd4RmpmZ0NOV3NNRWlWelprUzlwUWVDOUM2X2ZvSWk0QmlHcVlsaVdBdTNuak9Jc0xWUEdOQWhRcjdVNmZKcmFoZ3ZTV2RIcWVJZWVCSVhMdlEwekRqamQ2UVJ6TmtNSDd0OVRNalpjUHhhZDFRbnVhelBrR0Z1UlNjOXBqZlFBQzhUb0hBbVJHeXVkTWVHVnk2MU1pRGgwRERoTGk0RGVmYWo4WUFr</guid></item><item><title>发现癌症治愈方法？研究人员发现这种药物可以治愈这种可怕的疾病-印度时报 | Cancer cure found?

Now, according to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2025.1490621/full" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in Frontiers in Oncology, it seems that scientists have reached a consensus that medical cannabis can play a vital role in cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Castle, the lead author of the study and the research director at the Whole Health Oncology Institute, stated that the study intended to finally solidify the agreement of cannabis' potential as a cancer treatment. “Our goal was to determine the scientific consensus on the topic of medical cannabis, a field that has long been dominated by a war between cherry-picked studies,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by Cancer Playbook in cooperation with the Whole House Oncology Institute to collect, analyse and share data on patient-reported outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study on cannabis and cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at more than 10,000 studies related to medical cannabis and cancer. This large-scale research surpasses the scale of any previous study in the field. To move beyond bias–conscious or not–it was essential to use a large-scale, radically inclusive methodology based on mathematical reasoning,” said Castle. “We wanted to analyse not just a handful, but nearly every major medical cannabis study to find the actual points of scientific agreement", he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to analyse these studies, the team made use of an artificial intelligence natural language processing technique called "sentiment analysis". The technique allowed the researchers to verify how many studies had positive, negative and neutral views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The shocking results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

The study overwhelmingly supported the use of cannabis in treating cancer-related inflammation, appetite loss and nausea. Additionally, the surprising results also showcased that the drug could fight cancer cells themselves by killing them and stopping their spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a shocking degree of consensus in public health research, and certainly more than we were anticipating for a topic as controversial as medical cannabis,” said Castle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is cannabis used in medicine?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis is used in medicine in different forms.

That includes highly toxic compounds like &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/toxic-chemicals-substances/microplastics-phthalates-bpa-pfas-a1059022044/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Pfas, bisphenol and phthalates&lt;/a&gt;, which are linked to cancer, neurotoxicity, hormone disruption and developmental toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Microplastics have been found throughout the human body and can cross the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/21/microplastics-brain-pollution-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/27/microplastics-found-every-human-placenta-tested-study-health-impact#:~:text=The%20research%2C%20published%20in%20the,common%20plastics%20detected%2C%20after%20polyethylene." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;placental&lt;/a&gt; barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Montano’s latest paper is part of a &lt;a href="http://www.ecofoodfertility.it/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;larger project&lt;/a&gt; he’s leading for which he has also detected microplastics in human &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics11010040" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;urine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4457596" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;semen&lt;/a&gt;, and examines the impacts on fertility. He said he suspects microplastics are among chemicals driving plummeting sperm counts and a drop in overall sperm quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have proven this decline, especially in areas where pollution is bad,” Montano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Though men are more susceptible to the substance’s toxic effects, he added, women are also possibly impacted. Animal research has linked the presence of microplastics to ovarian dysfunction and health problems, like reduced oocyte maturation, and a lower capacity for fertilization. Another study on mice showed alterations to ovarian tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The paper notes a “possible presence of correlation between the concentration of microplastics” and reproductive health in the women who participated in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Montano added that the bisphenol, phthalates, Pfas and other highly toxic chemicals that use microplastics as a “Trojan horse” to get into the body, and into the ovaries, are “very dangerous”. The chemicals are already well-known for disrupting hormones and harming women’s reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The follicular fluid paper offers a “very important finding”, said Xiaozhong Yu, a University of New Mexico microplastics researcher, but he added that more work is needed to determine the dose and level of exposure at which adverse effects start to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is the work in the next phase – we need to quantify,” Yu said. His team is also attempting to answer some of those questions with broader epidemiological research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Montano’s team is doing similar work, and he’s spearheading research that is trying to determine how much reducing the use of plastic in the kitchen and eating an organic diet will reduce the level of microplastics in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The substances’ ubiquity makes it difficult to avoid, but reducing the amount of plastic used in the kitchen – from packaging to storage to utensils – can likely reduce exposures. Pesticides can contain microplastics, or in some cases are a form of microplastics, so eating organic may help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts also advise that people avoid heating plastic, or putting hot food and liquid in plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Single-use paper coffee cups, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/04/nist-study-shows-everyday-plastic-products-release-trillions-microscopic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can shed&lt;/a&gt; trillions of bits of plastic when hot liquid is added. Similarly, tea bags &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/microplastics-in-tea-bags-study-8770478" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can release&lt;/a&gt; billions of particles, and microwavable plastic is &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.3c01942" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;also a problem&lt;/a&gt;. Plastic utensils that briefly come into contact with hot pans can also leach chemicals; wood and stainless steel alternatives are less harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 23:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPOG55QUMtU0t3WDNtVU9DSUdjczlzUTlDV0RnclJBNjRqYUZ4bEJCNkZldEVwLVpITWhlODU1dmVLaFJfcVlHYjVDakxPbi1Za24xYmRZa0gxRGJ1ZjY3T0Z4d2tjYXZ1Vi1NRG0yMktYUzJjSkpXRktCanJEMU93TlpoSGxDVnJxbjJKRC0xQl9PS2NX</guid></item><item><title>另有3个州报告了2025年的首例麻疹病例- ABC新闻 | 3 more states report their first measles case of 2025 - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQc1pnUUFjdU5FeFV3bnhmeExFVndNM2psUTdZVEt1NFZzVEVOSHF3NW1KNGhySjRtc0pHcVhQbXM0SzdFcFRkYURhblhSUktuUENxbjlvQmtHRENKZW1qVVA2NWd6WWc0Vy1UZWJkQWdUN2V2MnZ2YS13ZkxMeFFaY19pOUJjM0lEVFHSAY8BQVVfeXFMTThBTDFLYVlIVnhGTW40UEhIeEFnWjc5N2pGSUZzLXFWSXFham9KLTBhTlVSNHBhVjZLMDBfNVBvUTMtR0Q3d205YUJlb3BfSUZrUERyMlV4c3RyZUZDTFlvVWlSeEVCY2NuS1dCTnh1bDUxTVJTUmRRUzlqRXVRNDY2b05SZUdYdWNZUFN2eEU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Louisiana, Virginia and Missouri all reported their first &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/Measles" target="_blank"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; cases of 2025 this weekend, with at least 27 states reporting at least one case.

Little mild fever. Spots came in the afternoon. Today, I woke up feeling good,” Edwards said in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is most contagious for about four days before and four days after the rash appears and is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:world’s most contagious diseases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;world’s most contagious diseases&lt;/a&gt;, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Doctors and public health experts said Edwards’ decision to go into the clinic put children, their parents and their community at risk because he could have spread it to others. They said there was no scenario in which Edwards’ conduct would be reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/robert-f-kennedy-jr" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kennedy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; met with Edwards about a week after the video was posted by Children’s Health Defense, the group Kennedy led for years until December. In &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:an April 6 post on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;an April 6 post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy said he “visited with these two extraordinary healers,” including Edwards and another doctor, and praised their use of two unproven treatments for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even as measles has exploded in Texas and spread across the country, Kennedy, the nation’s top health official, has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:declined to consistently and forcefully;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;declined to consistently and forcefully&lt;/a&gt; encourage people to vaccinate their children and remind them that the vaccine is safe. Kennedy’s post drawing attention to Edwards is inappropriate but unsurprising given Kennedy’s record, said Dr. Craig Spencer, a medical doctor who is also a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I think is unfortunately perfectly on-brand for how he thinks that medicine should be practiced,” Spencer said. “And that is what makes me remarkably uncomfortable and extremely concerned and scared for the next three-and-a-half years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It was unclear whether Kennedy knew that Edwards had gone into his clinic while infected with measles before meeting him. A spokesperson for Kennedy said he is not anti-vaccine and that he is “committed to improving children’s health in America and has re-deployed resources to Texas to help with the current outbreak.” He did not answer why the health secretary chose to meet with and praise Edwards rather than any of the other doctors in West Texas who have been treating children in the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Edwards told The Associated Press in an email that he “interacted with zero patients that were not already infected with measles” during the time he was infectious. “Therefore, obviously, there were no patients that were put in danger of acquiring measles since they already had measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But Jessica Steier, a public health scientist, said the video shows Edwards in the room with people who do not appear sick, including parents of sick children and the people who visited the clinic from Children’s Health Defense. She also questioned what steps Edwards was taking to confirm people were sick with measles, rather than relying on guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Steier, who runs the Science Literacy Lab and co-wrote &lt;a href="https://theunbiasedscipod.substack.com/p/dont-mess-with-measles-texas-doctor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:an article about Edwards’ conduct;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;an article about Edwards’ conduct&lt;/a&gt;, said while there may be some extraordinary emergencies where it would be appropriate for a sick doctor to work, this is not one of those situations because there is no shortage of providers who are not infected. She also pointed out that the video shows Edwards was not wearing a mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You have the HHS secretary lifting him up,” she said. “You know, it’s so, so dangerous. I really feel for the people who are on the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Children’s Health Defense has sued a number of news organizations, among them the AP, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy’s promotion of a doctor who has touted unproven measles treatments is “wholly irresponsible” but is in line with Kennedy’s long public record of anti-vaccine views, said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He said Kennedy has carried those views to his new job as the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He’s not the director of Children’s Health Defense anymore. He’s responsible for the health and well-being of children in this country,” Offit said. “It’s an emergency, but Kennedy is not treating it that way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 22:21:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPcWZPUnRaNE9Ud0gyRktpcGFsd2dCVC1ZOHR4QXJZTk9MZnpPSmpGMGtqMUtValRSV0U3eWhZdXBPX2MtMV9PbVc2OXdMaV9lSi1fMjdjQ0JpWkxUTlBhcVo3Ri1mVllXdTM1bHdZLW1aQzNiRkljTlZvMF93TlJ5SmtnNA</guid></item><item><title>视频显示医生正在治疗儿童麻疹。小RFK后来称赞他是一位“非凡”的治疗师- CNN | Video shows doctor with measles treating kids.

            A Texas doctor who has been treating children in a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-day-care-lubbock-3d90c3ea9050c12dbc74a8f8142a6355" target="_blank"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; was shown on video with a measles rash on his face in a clinic a week before Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met him and praised him as an “extraordinary” healer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp00053b6owejxkdhe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Ben Edwards appeared in the video posted March 31 by the anti-vaccine group Kennedy once led, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/how-rfk-jr-built-anti-vaccine-juggernaut-amid-covid-4997be1bcf591fe8b7f1f90d16c9321e" target="_blank"&gt;Children’s Health Defense&lt;/a&gt;. In it, Edwards appears wearing scrubs and talking with parents and children in a makeshift clinic he set up in Seminole, Texas, ground zero of the outbreak that has sickened hundreds of people and killed three, including two children.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp00063b6otupoj1g1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Edwards is asked whether he had measles, and he responded, “Yes,” then &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/nicole.zahra.5/videos/1196780422448813/" target="_blank"&gt;said his infection started the day before&lt;/a&gt; the video was recorded.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp00073b6ogtc7vmel@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yesterday was pretty achy. Little mild fever. Spots came in the afternoon. Today, I woke up feeling good,” Edwards said in the video.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp00083b6o391t32yb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is most contagious for about four days before and four days after the rash appears and is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/" target="_blank"&gt;world’s most contagious diseases&lt;/a&gt;, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Doctors and public health experts said Edwards’ decision to go into the clinic put children, their parents and their community at risk because he could have spread it to others. They said there was no scenario in which Edwards’ conduct would be reasonable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp00093b6opmydwb5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/robert-f-kennedy-jr" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; met with Edwards about a week after the video was posted by Children’s Health Defense, the group Kennedy led for years until December. In &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" target="_blank"&gt;an April 6 post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy said he “visited with these two extraordinary healers,” including Edwards and another doctor, and praised their use of two unproven treatments for measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp000a3b6o7y0t7nda@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even as measles has exploded in Texas and spread across the country, Kennedy, the nation’s top health official, has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263" target="_blank"&gt;declined to consistently and forcefully&lt;/a&gt; encourage people to vaccinate their children and remind them that the vaccine is safe. Kennedy’s post drawing attention to Edwards is inappropriate but unsurprising given Kennedy’s record, said Dr. Craig Spencer, a medical doctor who is also a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp000b3b6ow61lsjkv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think is unfortunately perfectly on-brand for how he thinks that medicine should be practiced,” Spencer said. “And that is what makes me remarkably uncomfortable and extremely concerned and scared for the next three-and-a-half years.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp000c3b6otb02l8kb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was unclear whether Kennedy knew that Edwards had gone into his clinic while infected with measles before meeting him. A spokesperson for Kennedy said he is not anti-vaccine and that he is “committed to improving children’s health in America and has re-deployed resources to Texas to help with the current outbreak.” He did not answer why the health secretary chose to meet with and praise Edwards rather than any of the other doctors in West Texas who have been treating children in the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp000d3b6ovkb6v78f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Edwards told The Associated Press in an email that he “interacted with zero patients that were not already infected with measles” during the time he was infectious. “Therefore, obviously, there were no patients that were put in danger of acquiring measles since they already had measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp000e3b6o68sz842p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Jessica Steier, a public health scientist, said the video shows Edwards in the room with people who do not appear sick, including parents of sick children and the people who visited the clinic from Children’s Health Defense. She also questioned what steps Edwards was taking to confirm people were sick with measles, rather than relying on guesswork.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp000f3b6o3p3hv6rx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Steier, who runs the Science Literacy Lab and co-wrote &lt;a href="https://theunbiasedscipod.substack.com/p/dont-mess-with-measles-texas-doctor" target="_blank"&gt;an article about Edwards’ conduct&lt;/a&gt;, said while there may be some extraordinary emergencies where it would be appropriate for a sick doctor to work, this is not one of those situations because there is no shortage of providers who are not infected. She also pointed out that the video shows Edwards was not wearing a mask.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp000g3b6oue0k5zwt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You have the HHS secretary lifting him up,” she said. “You know, it’s so, so dangerous. I really feel for the people who are on the ground.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp000h3b6ofy3sryx0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children’s Health Defense has sued a number of news organizations, among them the AP, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp000i3b6orrpg1adn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s promotion of a doctor who has touted unproven measles treatments is “wholly irresponsible” but is in line with Kennedy’s long public record of anti-vaccine views, said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He said Kennedy has carried those views to his new job as the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9orc1gp000j3b6omq2a91f4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He’s not the director of Children’s Health Defense anymore. He’s responsible for the health and well-being of children in this country,” Offit said. “It’s an emergency, but Kennedy is not treating it that way.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has 800 cases of measles nationwide as of Friday, and two more states identified outbreaks this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/news/national-international/texas-has-majority-of-nations-700-measles-cases-heres-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Texas is driving the high numbers&lt;/a&gt;, with an outbreak centered in West Texas that started nearly three months ago and is up to 597 cases. Two unvaccinated elementary school-aged children died from measles-related illnesses near the epicenter in Texas, and an adult in New Mexico who was not vaccinated died of a measles-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Other states with active outbreaks — defined as three or more cases — include Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Mexico. The U.S. has &lt;a href="/news/business/money-report/people-should-be-worried-about-measles-expert-says-what-to-know-about-the-disease-vaccine-and-how-to-stay-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;more than double the number of measles cases&lt;/a&gt; it saw in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. &lt;a href="/news/national-international/measles-immune-system-brain-swelling-long-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;It is preventable through vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Health experts fear the virus will take hold in other U.S. communities with low vaccination rates and that the spread could stretch on for a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North America, an outbreak in Ontario, Canada has sickened 925 from mid-October through April 16. That's on top of cases in Mexico that the World Health Organization has said are linked to the Texas outbreak. A large outbreak in Chihuahua state has 433 cases as of April 18, according to data from the state health ministry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what else you need to know about measles in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How many measles cases are there in Texas and New Mexico?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas state health officials said Friday there were 36 new cases of measles since Tuesday, bringing the total to 597 across 25 counties — most of them in West Texas. Four more Texans were hospitalized, for a total of 62 throughout the outbreak, and Parmer and Potter counties logger their first cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State health officials estimated about 4% of cases — fewer than 30 — are actively infectious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixty-two percent of Texas' cases are in Gaines County, population 22,892, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has logged 371 cases since late January — just over 1% of the county's residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Health officials in Texas said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February — Kennedy said age 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Mexico announced five new cases this week, bringing the state’s total to 63. Three more people were in the hospital this week, for a total of six since the outbreak started. Most of the state's cases are in Lea County. Two are in Eddy County and Chaves and Doña Ana counties have one each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State health officials say the cases are linked to Texas’ outbreak based on genetic testing. New Mexico reported its first measles-related death in an adult on March 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How many cases are there in Kansas?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kansas has 37 cases in eight counties in the southwest part of the state, health officials announced Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray and Morton counties have fewer than five cases each. Haskell County has the most with eight cases, Stevens County has seven, Kiowa County has six.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state's first reported case, identified in Stevens County on March 13, is linked to the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks based on genetic testing, a state health department spokesperson said. But health officials have not determined how the person was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How many cases are there in Oklahoma?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases in Oklahoma remained steady at 12 total cases Friday: nine confirmed and three probable. The first two probable cases were “associated” with the West Texas and New Mexico outbreaks, the state health department said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A state health department spokesperson said measles exposures were confirmed in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Rogers and Custer counties, but wouldn't say which counties had cases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How many cases are there in Ohio?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ohio Department of Health confirmed 30 measles cases in the state Thursday. The state county includes only Ohio residents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 14 cases in Ashtabula County near Cleveland, 14 in Knox County and one each in Allen and Holmes counties, the state said. The outbreak in Ashtabula County started with an unvaccinated adult who had interacted with someone who had traveled internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Knox County, in east-central Ohio, say there are a total of 20 people with measles, but seven of them do not live in Ohio. In 2022, a measles outbreak in central Ohio sickened 85.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How many cases are there in Indiana?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indiana has confirmed six connected cases of measles in Allen County in the northeast part of the state — four are unvaccinated minors and two are adults whose vaccination status is unknown. The cases have no known link to other outbreaks, the Allen County Department of Health said April 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How many cases are there in Pennsylvania?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In far northwest Pennsylvania, Erie County health officials declared a measles outbreak Monday after finding two new cases linked to a measles case confirmed March 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state has had nine cases overall this year, six of which are not linked to the outbreak, including international travel-related cases in Montgomery County and one in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How many cases are there in Michigan?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montcalm County, near Grand Rapids in western Michigan, has three linked measles cases. State health officials say the cases are tied to a large measles outbreak in Ontario, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state has seven confirmed measles cases as of Thursday, but the remaining four are not part of the Montcalm County outbreak. Michigan's last measles outbreak was in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been 800 cases in 2025 as of Friday, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 10 clusters — defined as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles cases have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What do you need to know about the MMR vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who have documentation that they had measles are immune and those born before 1957 generally don’t need the shots because most children back then had measles and now have “presumptive immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots. The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How can you treat measles?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;Vitamin D is widely known for boosting bone health, muscle strength and immune function, but it also has a range of other benefits — including cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;A new study published in the journal Nutrients suggests that the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vitamins-supplements" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;common vitamin&lt;/a&gt; is effective in preventing and treating colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hungarian researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 50 previous studies that included more than 1.3 million participants, focusing on vitamin D’s potential effects on cancer risk, immunity and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/vitamin-d-supplements-could-reduce-multiple-sclerosis-symptoms-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;COMMON VITAMIN SHOWN TO REDUCE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most important finding is that vitamin D plays a critical role in the prevention and treatment of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer/colon-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;," study author János Tamás Varga, PhD, associate professor at Semmelweis University in Budapest, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vitamin D is widely known for boosting bone health, muscle strength and immune function, but it also has a range of other benefits — including cancer prevention.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research clearly supports the strong correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (the primary form of vitamin D) levels and cancer outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; with low vitamin D levels showed poorer prognoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D has been shown to reduce inflammation, promote the death of cancer cells, inhibit tumor growth and enhance immune response, the researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/vitamin-d-deficiency-dementia-populations-levels-very-low-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY LINKED TO DEMENTIA IN CERTAIN POPULATIONS WHEN LEVELS ARE VERY LOW: STUDY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These mechanisms significantly influence the pathophysiology of colorectal cancer," Varga noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to prevention, vitamin D supplementation was also shown to improve &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;survival rates&lt;/a&gt; among patients with advanced-stage colorectal cancer, according to the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results suggest that the effect of vitamin D may depend on factors such as the dosage, the individual condition of the patients and the duration of treatment," Vargas added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The primary source of vitamin D is exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society (ACS) has previously referenced studies suggesting that vitamin D could lower cancer risk, particularly colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, large studies have not found that vitamin D supplements lower the risk of colorectal polyps (pre-cancerous growths) or cancer," the ACS stated on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"The optimal dosage should be tailored to the individual’s health condition and current vitamin D levels." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One important limitation of the research is that the studies included in the analysis used different vitamin D dosages and involved patients at various stages of cancer, the authors noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They called for &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;further research&lt;/a&gt; to accurately determine the optimal dosage and "therapeutic efficacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for Americans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on our research, we recommend that individuals at high risk of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; monitor their vitamin D levels and, if necessary, take a daily vitamin D supplement of 1000–4000 IU, especially for those with low vitamin D levels," lead study author Dr. Monika Fekete, medical doctor at Semmelweis University, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The optimal dosage should be tailored to the individual’s health condition and current vitamin D levels." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For physicians, the researchers suggest routinely measuring and supplementing vitamin D levels for both prevention and treatment purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vitamin D plays a crucial role in the treatment and prevention of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/cancer-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;, but further research is needed to determine the optimal dosage and the specific role of genetic factors," Fekete added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt;

They are a good source of B vitamins, calcium, zinc, magnesium and vitamin E. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nuts are high in fiber and low in monosaturated fats, helping to lower cholesterol and improve heart health, as well as reduce stroke risk. They are also said to ease inflammation in the body, strengthen bones and improve cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One essential mineral in Brazil nuts, selenium, is believed to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14599809/Cancer-dietitian-budget-snack-cancer.html"&gt;boost the immune system and support thyroid function&lt;/a&gt;, but too much of it could actually have the opposite effect and be harmful to your health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People 14 and older are advised to get 55 micrograms (mcg) of selenium per day. The recommendations for babies, children and young teens range from 15 mcg and 40 mcg per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Selenium does have benefits, but it is easy to over consume this powerful mineral, and Brazil nuts contain a very high concentration of it - about 544mcg per 1oz portion, which is typically just six nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to this high content, people are cautioned to not consume more than one to two nuts per day, as too much selenium has been linked to difficulty breathing, tremors, kidney failure and heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while previous research has suggested selenium has cancer preventative properties, newer studies actually suggest the opposite - it may increase the risk of developing the disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brazil nuts contain a very high concentration of selenium - about 544micrograms per 1oz portion, which is typically just six nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The daily recommended value of the mineral is also readily available in tuna, sardines, shrimp, beef, pork, turkey, eggs and spaghetti - but these can be enjoyed without worrying of overdosing on selenium.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Steven Quay, a physician-scientist specializing in cancer research, called selenium a 'double-edged sword.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told DailyMail.com: 'On one hand, it’s a vital trace mineral your body uses for DNA synthesis, thyroid function, and immunity. On the other? Cross the 400 mcg/day line and you’re flirting with selenosis — garlic breath, brittle nails, and worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some studies praise it for neutralizing mercury’s toxicity, while others warn: “Not a cancer shield, folks.” The truth? Dose matters. Like all powerful tools, it's about balance — not abundance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While people only need a small amount of selenium, it does play an important role in the body. It is involved in the production and protection of DNA, and, according to the NIH has been shown to boost cognitive scores in older adults and improve sperm motility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Martina Ambardjieva, a urologist, told DailyMail.com: 'Selenium does have benefits when taken in limited, doctor-recommended amounts.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, consuming too much - the NIH says the upper safe limit for people over 14 years old is 400 mcg - can lead to selenium toxicity and cause a wide array of symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These, Dr Ambardjieva said, include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, diseased nails, rotting teeth, arthritis and inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not known how many cases of selenium toxicity are recorded each year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the dangers, because of selenium's DNA protective properties, the mineral has long been thought to play a role in the prevention of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a comprehensive review on the matter found different.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2018 Cochrane &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005195.pub4/full"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; called Selenium for Preventing Cancer examined whether selenium intake or supplementation reduces cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analyzing data from 10 studies involving over 27,000 people, the review found there was no evidence that selenium supplements decrease cancer incidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the researchers said some of the studies included in their review 'raised concerns' because they reported a higher occurrence of prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes in people taking a selenium supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not only does the mineral not prevent cancer, but other studies show it could actually increase risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The daily recommended value of selenium is also readily available in supplements, as well as foods like tuna, sardines, shrimp, beef, pork, turkey, eggs and spaghetti&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Above is a graph showing the increase in cancer rates among people younger than 50 (the blue line represents women and the green line represents men)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-66553-5#Tab1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;published in the journal Nature found people with both the lowest and highest intake of selenium had a greater chance of developing cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After analyzing nearly 3,000 people from a database in Vietnam, researchers found the 'safe' intake level of selenium was 111 mcg to 124 mcg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who consumed 28 mcg to 77 mcg and those who took in 169 mcg to 332 mcg both had an increased risk of developing cancer. The association was highest for stomach, colon, rectum and lung cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For high-intake, the odds of developing cancer were 86 percent higher.

While doctors have repeatedly recommended factors like eating well and trying to do new activities to support brain health, research over the last few years has found two habits worth prioritizing in your daily life: &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63021061/how-many-miles-should-you-walk-a-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; and spending time with loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every walk you take is a step toward a sharper mind in more ways than one. A growing body of research shows that regular walking can boost memory, sharpen focus, and even slow cognitive decline—including reducing risk of developing dementia. Separate research has shown that walking can boost creativity, too. People who were physically active—including with walking—at some point within the last 3.5 hours showed processing speeds equivalent to someone four years younger while playing brain games, a recent &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62895429/walking-brain-health-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/abm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/abm/kaae059/7828202?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Annals of Behavioral Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Annals of Behavioral Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second game changer for your thinker: socialization. Your brain thrives on connection, and research backs this up. A separate body of research shows that regular social connection can shore up memory, problem-solving, and also reduce &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63902567/b12-dementia-risk-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dementia risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;. One study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(22)00199-4/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Lancet Healthy Longevity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Healthy Longevity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that people who interacted with family and friends on a weekly or monthly basis had a slower rate of memory decline than those who socialized less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/doctors/howard-jonathan-edward/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jonathan Howard, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jonathan Howard, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a neurologist at NYC Health and Hospitals/Bellevue. &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/geriatric-medicine/ca/santa-monica/scott-kaiser-1205042470" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scott Kaiser, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scott Kaiser, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is the director of geriatric cognitive health for the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center. &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev, MD,&lt;/a&gt; is medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, it's worth exploring whether doing both at once would be a double whammy for brain health. While this powerhouse combo hasn’t technically been studied formally just yet, doctors say there might be something to this health hack. Let's investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Walking With A Loved One Is A Smart Combo For Brain Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few mechanisms at play. One is the fact that walking is simply a great form of exercise. “Anything that improves overall cardiovascular health will help reduce dementia risk,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/doctors/howard-jonathan-edward/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jonathan Howard, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jonathan Howard, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at NYC Health and Hospitals/Bellevue. Your brain needs healthy blood vessels to function properly, get nutrients, and remove toxins, and there's an established &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-factors-heart-disease-linked-dementia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:link;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; between heart disease and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting your steps in can help support overall health—and that will do your brain a solid too, says &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev, MD,&lt;/a&gt; medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. “Overall health is important for brain health,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking directly boosts brain health, too. It &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.122.039919" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:triggers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;triggers&lt;/a&gt; the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that supports nerve cell growth and survival in the brain and spinal cord. BDNF is involved in crucial tasks like memory and learning, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/geriatric-medicine/ca/santa-monica/scott-kaiser-1205042470" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scott Kaiser, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scott Kaiser, MD&lt;/a&gt;, director of geriatric cognitive health for the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center. “That helps to create a well-functioning brain network,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking also can help reduce your overall stress levels. Stress can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763421000531" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:negatively impact;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;negatively impact&lt;/a&gt; your brain on a cellular level when it goes unchecked, and ramping up your step count can help counteract this, says Dr. Kaiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time with loved ones is an &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.19111158" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-stressor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-stressor&lt;/a&gt;, too, and can support &lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/102/13/1009" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:good heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;good heart health&lt;/a&gt; which, again, ultimately boosts brain health, Dr. Kaiser says. There may even be an indirect link here: “If you’re feeling well connected, you may be more likely to make better choices for your health—and brain health—around drinking, eating, and substance abuse,” Dr. Kaiser says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Women's Sneakers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether walking around the house or around the neighborhood, these “perfectly comfortable and lightweight shoes are a great value at an affordable price,” says Jacqueline Andriakos, &lt;em&gt;WH&lt;/em&gt; executive health and fitness director.

(However, a 28-week group-walking program helped people with dementia maintain a steady quality of life over the testing period, and the intervention was well-liked by both participants and their caregivers.) There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29084328/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; to support the benefits of group exercise, particularly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10464750/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:outdoor group exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;outdoor group exercise&lt;/a&gt;, especially when it comes to lowering stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that exercising is good and that socializing in groups is beneficial,” Dr. Kaiser says. “Theoretically, the benefits for brain health could be greater when you do them together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Often To Walk With Your Loved Ones For Optimal Brain Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to put a specific number on this, given that research hasn't extended into this territory just yet. If you want to set a lofty goal, Dr. Howard suggests trying to walk for 30 minutes at a time on most days of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it can be tricky to consistently block out that time with family and friends, Dr. Kaiser just recommends doing what you can. “Most evidence suggests that inactivity is bad and any amount of activity is a good amount,” he says. “But, in general, more is better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If going for longer walks with loved ones is hard to pull off, Dr. Kaiser recommends trying to squeeze in “&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64479203/can-walking-keep-you-in-shape/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:exercise snacks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;exercise snacks&lt;/a&gt;,” like walking out of the office at the end of the night with your work buddy or taking a lap around the neighborhood with your mom during a visit instead of catching up on the couch. You can also try taking up your own &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64516114/benefits-of-walking-for-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking habit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking habit&lt;/a&gt; and socializing by chatting on the phone with loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, you can take up this new habit any time. “I can’t think of any age group that won’t benefit from this,” Dr. Kaiser says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot that goes into &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62854242/how-to-improve-brain-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supporting good brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;supporting good brain health&lt;/a&gt;, but walking with a loved one checks off a lot of boxes and gets in some quality social time, too. “It makes sense to kill two birds with one stone,” Dr. Howard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 17:19:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1GWWFFSUNIcjg0Qk5aS3NFalN1Sl9WRi1BRlQyYk1sak5JOEJQU3praDl2M2dBWGVZLVBZTE9IWmlrdkVXamxiLVlXaGVKYzNSRVJTcVI0bWZuVlgtLWFUX0d2X3dybkg3Y1h4Q0hyNTUzeFVGeGd5RA</guid></item><item><title>蒙大拿州卫生官员确认5例麻疹-《东爱达荷新闻》 | Montana health officials confirm five cases of measles - East Idaho News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPczNkMFNTRDVFa0lnM0xLRzNSbE5mcHlsWnVWQ2JPQ211cDR5c2ZTMjBtX2p5NDZZTURFMmxtdVlQcERVN09NQngzZ29PeTd5bUVURUphT0cxcjJ4UFZDcDhnTVM3aVFVMFFqcVkxR3A4RE9qM3U1M3lEUDBUYjNVdDZDc3QzamFfR0FTc0VScjY2eVBvelhGUg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleText"&gt; &lt;p&gt;BOZEMAN, Montana (&lt;a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2025/04/17/montana-health-officials-confirm-five-cases-of-measles/"&gt;Daily Montanan&lt;/a&gt;) — Montana Health officials have announced five confirmed cases of measles in Gallatin County.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services along with the Gallatin City-County Health Department in Bozeman confirmed its the first instance of the highly infectious disease since 1990.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The individuals are children and adults who were exposed to measles while traveling outside of Montana. The cases reside in Gallatin County and are currently isolated at home. All five individuals are unvaccinated, or vaccine status is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Gallatin City-County Health Department continues to assess any potential exposures while the individuals were contagious and are contacting the people who may have been exposed, commonly referred to as “contact tracing.” People potentially exposed are being provided with information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Gallatin health department has determined that there are points of exposure to the general public. Potential exposures to the public can be found on the &lt;a href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.healthygallatin.org%2Fcommunity-health%2Fcommunicable-diseases%2Fmeasles%2F/1/010001964601864d-62a3bb21-515b-42fd-b5b4-decd2803b9c7-000000/53KDxEUHPpNRD8paqRLBxCs5an-DMVumHoatIWH0s5g=401"&gt;GCCHD website&lt;/a&gt; and will be updated as needed or as more information becomes available. The spread of measles can occur before people know they have the disease, and before any rash appears. The times listed on the website include the period when the exposure occurred and two hours after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Individuals who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While it is unfortunate to have cases of measles after 35 years of disease inactivity in Montana, we have been working diligently with our local partners to prepare,” said DPHHS Public Health Physician Dr. Maggie Cook-Shimanek. “We are confident that our public health and clinical partners will work together and address this situation as quickly as possible. It is important for everyone to know their vaccination status and to visit with their health department or health care provider if they are unsure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are unsure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reach out to the health department where you grew up.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Check your home state immunization registries.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that typically begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body. It is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Measles is highly contagious and highly preventable with vaccination, and ensuring people are immunized remains our best defense. If people are unable to find their vaccine records, there are no contraindications to receiving an additional dose,” said Dr. Peter Bulger, Gallatin City-County Health Department medical director.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97 to 99% effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are in need of the MMR vaccine, please call your primary care physician as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are actively working with individuals who are experiencing symptoms,”said Lori Christenson, Gallatin City-County Health Officer. “We greatly appreciate the cooperation of those involved in helping mitigate further exposures. We encourage anyone who is not vaccinated or unsure of their vaccination history to consider vaccination and to contact your health care provider or GCCHD. By getting vaccinated we protect ourselves and others around us from infection.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no cure for measles once the outbreak has started. It’s a virus and medical professionals treat the symptoms related to the infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information about &lt;a href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fdphhs.mt.gov%2Fpublichealth%2Fcdepi%2Fdiseases%2FMeasles/1/010001964601864d-62a3bb21-515b-42fd-b5b4-decd2803b9c7-000000/dkr27nVubSLhStZLt7oOCYb-oEYnKM_vSpmwtyI5--E=401"&gt;measles and the measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, visit the state health department’s website.
