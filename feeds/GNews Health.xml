    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most flu patients do not die from the infection, but rather a complication triggered by the disease. The disease can weaken the immune system, raising the risk of someone suffering from sepsis or pneumonia, which can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flu levels are currently 'minimal' nationwide, according to CDC surveillance, but have risen slightly in four states, including North Carolina. Other states with elevated levels are Connecticut, Illinois and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levels of RSV and norovirus are also low nationwide, but Covid levels are 'moderate', according to wastewater surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that as colder weather hits, people will spend more time mixing indoors, allowing respiratory viruses to spread easily between individuals. They say levels are currently low because the nation is in the early stages of the winter virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every year, infections, hospitalizations and deaths from respiratory viruses tend to peak between December and February, before gradually declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, an estimated 40million Americans were infected with the flu, while 400,000 were hospitalized and 25,000 died from complications linked to their infections, in what the CDC called 'one of the worst' flu seasons in over a decade. In that year, cases peaked in early February, before gradually declining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In North Carolina, the state recorded its worst flu season last year since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, registering 544 fatalities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;North Carolina's Department of Health revealed the flu fatality in a press release posted online on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It comes after six counties in California, including Sonoma County (shown above), reimposed their mask mandates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is now urging all residents aged six months and over to ensure they receive a flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also said Covid vaccines were recommended for everyone aged six months and over, even after the Robert F Kennedy-run CDC shifted its guidelines to recommend Covid vaccines to those aged 18 years and older. The agency says parents of children aged six months to 17 years should discuss the benefits of vaccination with their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the CDC shows that in the week to September 20, the latest available, there were eight flu-related deaths recorded nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is outside the start of the 2025 to 2026 flu season, which the CDC says begins in October, but indicates that flu deaths were likely recorded elsewhere in the US this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wake County Director of Nursing, Tina Payton, with Wake County being the North Carolina County for Raleigh, the capital of the state in its central area, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abc11.com/post/flu-death-2025-season-nc-person-dies-related-illness-first-influenza-vax-urged-wake-opens-clinic/17965330/"&gt;ABC11&lt;/a&gt;: 'We see more respiratory illnesses as it gets colder and we're headed into that season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It gives you a chance to build your immunity before the holidays come up, and that's always a big time where people get together indoors and there's a higher opportunity for illness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The news comes after at least six counties in California's Bay Area&lt;span&gt; -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Contra Costa, Santa Clara, Sonoma, Napa, San Mateo and Santa Cruz - reimposed mask mandates in some health care settings. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the North Carolina Department of Health shows the proportion of ED visits due to respiratory viruses over the last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Flu activity remains minimal across much of the US, although it has ticked up slightly in four states, Connecticut, Illinois, North Carolina and Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Starting November 1, each will require health workers and, in some cases, visitors or patients, to wear face coverings in medical settings used by frail, ailing or vulnerable patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mandate in Sonoma County has been set to be renewed every year unless it is repealed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are scant reports of other counties considering face mask mandates at present, although experts say this may shift as cooler weather approaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data for North Carolina shows visits to the state's Emergency Departments for a respiratory disease dropped to 5.4 percent of the total in the week to October 4, the latest available, down from 6.4 percent in the previous seven-day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid-like illnesses, infections that are suspected to be Covid but are not confirmed, were the most common reason for ED visits, behind 1.8 percent in the latest week, followed by flu-like, at 0.6 percent, and RSV-like, at 0.2 percent, with both of these also being infections suspected to be down to these diseases that had not been confirmed via tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The remaining 2.8 percent did not have the type of respiratory virus they were suffering from determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 17:52:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOYVR5azhudXl4aGhvT29EMVdSWXZLQVpoWGZMV3d5OElPbDZ3VXZ1RnpWOUJjdC1ZZ2Q0TjM5RTg4bXJsRVVZZjlVVGxJVzN3VUtlc1R3ZV9xTHBzMTl3S1ExZUtEdjZlaEVwWFNsSlcwcHlSN0tVeGpFczlBX19RZzJFX3NEOHBWNTNFYlFHRy1SQdIBlwFBVV95cUxPV0dnYkp4RDFNcmdGaVRfbzhaSWdHeVlKNXlRQThwOWE1c1pqU25HYU53clp2RFRzOGJaNnlJajdxY3pZUHdCcHdpOTJMVzNSVmZhbmlTZDFZUmsyVWhncS1USTB3dzh6SkdwbHRWTksyT2piaU1CUFB4blRqSk1Gc0Y3eFlKd1dmbW4xaGZiclF3eC13REJj</guid></item><item><title>由于“绝对数字” ，专家发出警报，致命的罕见癌症在年轻人中激增-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15178747/breast-cancer-rising-women-American-Cancer-Society.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists are warning that rates of a rare but highly deadly cancer are on the rise in the US, with cases climbing three times faster than other forms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A key finding from 2012 to 2021 was that the invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), a type of breast cancer, incidence &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13912601/doctors-warn-cancer-rate-rising-young-people.html"&gt;climbed at an average&lt;/a&gt; annual rate of 2.8 percent in women 50 and older and 2.9 percent among women younger than 50.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This rise across age groups exceeds the 0.8 percent increase for all other breast cancers combined. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The period from 2016 to 2021 was most concerning, showing an even sharper annual increase of 3.4 percent. Hormonal and lifestyle factors, not genetics, are the primary drivers behind the rising rates of invasive lobular carcinoma, experts say.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the American Cancer Society reported this week that the steepest rise in lobular breast cancer cases was among Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) women, with an increase of 4.4 percent per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite this rapid increase, white women still have the highest overall case rate with nearly 15 cases per 100,000 women, compared to 11 per 100,000 among Black women and approximately seven per 100,000 among AAPI women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Angela Giaquinto, an associate scientist for cancer surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, said: ‘Although lobular breast cancer accounts for a little over 10 percent of all breast cancers, the sheer number of new diagnoses each year makes this disease important to understand.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lobular form of the disease appears to grow in ways that differ from the other breast cancers, with cells proliferating in dispersed patterns as opposed to forming a lump typical of other cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lobular breast cancer grows differently than other breast cancers. Instead of forming a distinct lump, its cells spread in dispersed patterns. This makes it more difficult to detect through traditional mammograms and physical exams (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The growth pattern of ILC doesn't make it categorically more aggressive in terms of metastasis, but it makes its spread differently, sometimes later, and to unusual locations, which poses unique &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14150127/mammogram-cancer-incurable-Doctors-reveal-harder-spot-stop-happening-YOU.html"&gt;challenges for detection&lt;/a&gt; and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers analyzed national cancer data, comparing invasive lobular breast cancer cases against all other types to track incidence trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using specialized software, they calculated rates and tested for statistical differences in trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also compared patient and tumor characteristics between lobular and ductal cancers and analyzed their ten-year survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While ILC has a similar five-year survival rate to other breast cancers, its long-term outlook is less favorable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ten-year survival rate is lower, largely because ILC has a higher risk of late recurrence and tends to spread to uncommon sites in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For lobular cancer that has spread distantly, the 10-year survival rate is only 12.1 percent compared to 19.6 percent for the more common ductal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lobular breast cancer is becoming more common, and its long-term survival rates are low once it spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to finding that rates of ILC are rising over three times faster than all other breast cancers, its slight survival advantage in the first few years disappears over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Giaquinto said: ‘Also, survival rates beyond seven years are significantly lower for [lobular breast cancer] than the most common type of breast cancer, highlighting the pressing need for prevention and early detection strategies targeting this subtype to be brought to the forefront.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This chart tracks lobular breast cancer diagnosis rates across different racial and ethnic groups in the US from 1975 through 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;White women had the highest rates across every age group, with risk peaking between ages 70-79 before declining&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors conclude that ILC's unique biology, which makes it harder to detect and potentially less responsive to chemotherapy, requires specific research and clinical attention to improve these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior researcher Rebecca Siegel, senior scientific director for cancer surveillance research at the ACS, said: ‘Invasive lobular breast cancer is very understudied, probably because of a very good short-term prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But at 10 years, these women with metastatic disease are half as likely to be alive as their counterparts with ductal cancer, probably because of the unique spread and resistance to therapy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are occurring consistently across all age groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The uniform pattern is notable because ILC is rising at similar rates in both younger and older populations, unlike some other breast cancer types that typically show more variation between age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers pointed to hormonal and lifestyle risk factors as the main drivers of the increasing incidence over genetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ILC is described as being ‘more strongly associated with female hormone exposure’ than other breast cancers, evidenced by a steeper drop in ILC cases when menopausal women’s use of hormone therapy went down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The chart tracks ten-year ILC survival from 2007 to 2021. While early-stage ILC shows better survival, distant-stage disease survival plummets to just 12 percent compared to 20 percent for ductal carcinoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also specifically pointed to the impacts of increasing rates of excess body weight, a younger age at first menstruation and having fewer children or having a first birth at an older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Factors that extend a woman's lifetime exposure to estrogen, such as a later age at menopause, along with increased alcohol consumption in some groups, are also identified as significant contributors to the growing number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research was published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.70061"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, the journal of the American Cancer Society.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Siegel concluded: ‘Our study underscores the need for much more information on lobular cancers across the board, from genetic studies to clinical trial data, so we can improve outcomes for the increasing number of women affected with this cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkykd2u000l3b78bql0ymmb@published"&gt;I recently discovered what I still can’t believe: My in-laws have been allowing our 15-year-old son, “David,” to drink beer at their house. Apparently, this has been going on for months!&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkyki0p000o3b7860bsu99i@published"&gt;The worst part? My husband, “Walter,” thinks it’s no big deal. He even admitted that &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; parents let him do the same thing at David’s age! His excuse is that it’s “just one beer with dinner” and they’re not letting him get drunk—so it’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="35" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkykjrl000r3b78zac2o0hn@published"&gt;I disagree entirely. I told my in-laws that David—and his younger brother—will not be visiting them for the foreseeable future. Now Walter, his parents, and even David are ganging up on me, claiming I’m overreacting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="120" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkyk6g4000i3b7814enbbz0@published"&gt;You have every right to put your foot down and say that your minor son should not be drinking under any circumstances. However, try to be understanding of your husband’s position; his parents let him drink as a kid and thus, he doesn’t see a problem with it. His family’s position isn’t exactly unique, as there are some folks who think it’s better to let a young person experiment with alcohol at home than to let them discover it on the streets. Explain to him kindly that drinking a beer with family can easily be a gateway to sneaking booze behind your backs and that you do not want to send your son the message that drinking at 15 is OK.&lt;/p&gt;

Let your in-laws know that you are not wavering on your stance, and that your boys can’t visit with them until you have their word that they won’t allow them to drink until they are of age. Tell your sons that your rule may not be fun, but it is designed to keep them alive and from harming others. Everyone can be mad at you if they want, but you know that what you are doing is in your children’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkydfiz000ki0j8yyijt6l7@published"&gt;When I first met my husband, he told me he’d never touched a drink, never smoked, and never taken any sort of drug. He had a family history of addiction, and having seen what it does to people, he decided it probably wasn’t worth it. As someone who never became addicted to alcohol but partied a bit too hard in my early 20s, I really respected that. He never asked that I not drink, though by the time I met him, I wasn’t going out often anyways. Over time, his relationship with his alcoholic mother grew worse until we had to cut her out of our lives entirely, and his sister recently died of a drug overdose. He’s since become a health fanatic. We have three kids between the ages of 13 and 9. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/05/health-obsessed-dad-parenting-advice-from-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;He’s now obsessed with perceived unhealthiness in our family, and it’s doing something really strange to our kids.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it gets worse: Hypertension also increases the risk of dementia and cognitive decline. And heart disease, stroke, and dementia are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm#" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., respectively. Unfortunately, only one-in-four people with a history of high blood pressure have this condition under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In August 2025, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, based on a comprehensive analysis of literature published over the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Conversation U.S. asked &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24559" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain what the new guidelines mean, and how you can work with your doctor to manage your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why did blood pressure guidelines change?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The most recent guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prior to this new statement were in 2017;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;prior to this new statement were in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, the medical community has learned a lot about hypertension and the best way to control it. The new guidelines provide a great deal of new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First, the definition of hypertension has changed: The criteria are more strict, and the target blood pressures are lower than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The criteria depend on the values of the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/which-blood-pressure-number-is-important" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“systolic” and the “diastolic” pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;“systolic” and the “diastolic” pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Systolic blood pressure, the top number, represents the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is squeezing blood into the body. Diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number, is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing. Both numbers are important when determining the severity of hypertension and how it is most appropriately managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new guidelines have removed the category of “prehypertension,” which was defined by a systolic pressure of 120 to 139 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), or a diastolic pressure of 80 to 99 mm Hg. Now, patients are categorized as having “elevated blood pressure” if their blood pressure is 120 to 129 over less than 80 mm Hg, or stage 1 hypertension if they are 130 to 139/80 to 89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A reading of 140/90 or more is considered stage 2 hypertension, and a reading of 180/120 or greater is a hypertensive crisis. In essence, the bar has been lowered, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25466" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this change may impact millions of Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this change may impact millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People need to ask their doctors if they have hypertension based on these new criteria, and whether or not they should be treated. It is also very important for patients to get advice from their doctors about lifestyle habits that they can incorporate into their daily routine, like diet, exercise and healthy sleep habits to help &lt;a href="https://katiecouric.com/health/how-to-lower-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition, the guidelines encourage providers to use a risk calculator, called PREVENT — short for &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS&lt;/a&gt; — to determine a patient’s overall risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure. This tool represents a significant advance in personalizing medical care, since it incorporates risk factors unique to the individual, allowing for a tailored approach to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What’s the link between alcohol intake and high blood pressure?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The guidelines encourage people to limit alcohol intake because alcohol increases blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis of seven studies with nearly 20,000 people showed that systolic blood pressure will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increase by about 1 mm Hg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;increase by about 1 mm Hg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed&lt;/a&gt;. A standard beer contains about 14 grams of alcohol, so regular alcohol consumption may increase blood pressure by several points over time. For people who have been consistently drinking excessive amounts of alcohol but later stop drinking, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.HYP.33.2.653" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:their blood pressure may come back down;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;their blood pressure may come back down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That might not sound like much of an impact, but when combined with other unhealthy and risky behaviors, like sedentary behavior, excessive weight, inadequate sleep, psychological stress, and smoking, the risk factors start to add up quickly. Together, they can very quickly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001303" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new guidelines encourage patients to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt;, compared with the old guidelines. For people who do want to drink alcohol, the new guidelines recommend that men should drink no more than two drinks per day, and women should drink no more than one drink per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What other lifestyle factors did the new report focus on?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize the fact that diet can have a major impact on blood pressure. They recommend that all adults — with or without hypertension — consume less than 2,300 milligrams of salt, or approximately 1 teaspoon, per day, and more ideally, less than 1,500 milligrams per day. For a comparison, the average &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt&lt;/a&gt; per day. Patients may also consider potassium-based salt substitutes to further lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The guidelines recommend a specific diet called the &lt;a href="https://katiecouric.com/health/how-to-lower-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, for patients with or without hypertension to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat or nonfat dairy, and whole grains.

On average, for every additional 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a person gets per week, systolic blood pressure decreases by 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure drops by 1 mm Hg, with the largest reduction occurring at 150 minutes of dynamic exercise per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Regular exercise also helps you &lt;a href="https://katiecouric.com/health/aging/how-to-live-longer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:live longer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;live longer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/as-wrestling-fans-reel-from-the-sudden-death-of-hulk-hogan-a-cardiologist-explains-how-to-live-long-and-healthy-and-avoid-chronic-disease-262103" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What are the main preventive strategies in the report?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The PREVENT risk calculator that the new guidelines recommend incorporates several factors, including demographics, cholesterol levels, medical history, and blood pressure, to determine risk.

But it’s &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; helpful for people with multiple chronic conditions, like hypertension, high cholesterol, overweight/obesity, or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The American Heart Association recommends &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eight essential health behaviors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;eight essential health behaviors&lt;/a&gt; for controlling blood pressure and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease overall: These include healthy diet, regular exercise, stopping or avoiding smoking, sleeping seven to nine hours per night, and controlling weight, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Will the new guidelines change how doctors address high blood pressure?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the greatest advances with these new guidelines is the personalized approach to medical care through the use of the PREVENT calculator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The guidelines recommend that doctors encourage their patients to check blood pressure at home to better understand the fluctuations in pressure that occur throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Finally, the guidelines encourage physicians to be more aggressive about treating blood pressure. This may be an important change, since uncontrolled blood pressure is a major risk factor for eventual development of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;William Cornwell is an associate professor of cardiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Conversation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

This pattern differs enough from that of neurotypical adults that a machine learning algorithm was able to accurately classify individuals with ADHD based on these visual traits with over 90 percent accuracy. The same approach was also able to distinguish whether a person with ADHD regularly takes stimulant medication. These findings indicate that ADHD may involve a consistent, underlying difference in how the brain handles brief moments of perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by symptoms such as inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. It affects around 3 to 4 percent of Canadian adults and about 2.6 percent of adults worldwide. While researchers have known for some time that ADHD influences attention, memory, and executive functioning, less is known about how it affects the brain’s handling of incoming sensory information—especially how that processing changes from one moment to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies using brainwave recordings have shown that people with ADHD often display different patterns of electrical activity, particularly in the alpha and theta frequency bands. However, these findings have not always been consistent. To better understand the functional impacts of such oscillations, the researchers behind this new study used a method called random temporal sampling, which allows them to track how efficiently someone processes visual information across tiny slices of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their goal was to explore whether ADHD is associated with a distinct rhythm or timing in visual perception, which could reflect underlying neural oscillations. If such a rhythm exists and is consistent across individuals with ADHD, it could provide a new behavioral marker for identifying the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In light of the relatively high incidence of ADHD, there is surprisingly little that we know about it for sure,” said study author Martin Arguin, a professor of psychology at the University of Montreal and director of &lt;a href="https://www.neurocognitionvisionlab.org/en" target="_blank"&gt;the Neurocognitive Vision Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is especially true of the neural bases of the disorder. My lab had recently brought to maturity the technique of random temporal sampling, which serves to capture temporal variations in perceptual efficiency. Given that these temporal variations can be assumed originate from oscillatory neural activity, we thought that examining ADHD from this perspective might bring a positive contribution to our knowledge of the disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited young adult participants from two colleges in Quebec. A total of 49 people were included in the final analysis: 26 were neurotypical controls and 23 had received a formal ADHD diagnosis. Among those with ADHD, 17 regularly used stimulant medication while six did not. All participants had normal or corrected vision and completed a battery of visual tasks under controlled conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central experiment involved briefly showing participants a series of five-letter French words overlaid with visual noise. The visibility of each word varied rapidly during the 200 milliseconds it appeared on the screen. Participants were asked to read the word aloud, and researchers recorded whether they were correct. The contrast of the noise was continuously adjusted so that each participant would average about 50 percent correct responses, ensuring a balanced challenge across individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What set this experiment apart was how the noise varied. It wasn’t static; instead, the signal-to-noise ratio changed throughout the 200-millisecond window in a pattern composed of multiple sine waves at different frequencies. This random fluctuation allowed researchers to analyze how well participants could extract the word at each moment in time, depending on the frequency of the noise changes. The technique generated what are called classification images—maps showing how efficiently each person processed the visual input at different times and frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing the classification images of those with and without ADHD, the researchers could examine whether there were consistent group differences in the rhythm of visual processing. They then used a machine learning model trained on features extracted from these classification images to see if it could distinguish between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classification images revealed consistent differences in visual processing patterns between participants with ADHD and those without. Although the general structure of visual processing looked similar across both groups, certain frequencies showed marked differences. These included processing oscillations at 5, 10, and 15 cycles per second (Hz), particularly when the noise in the stimulus oscillated at 30 to 40 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The immediate implication of our results is that, in ADHD, there seems to be a systematic divergence in visual function from that of individuals with typical development,” Arguin told PsyPost. “This divergence points to a difference in brain function that has yet to be clearly determined.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these patterns were fed into a machine learning algorithm, it was able to classify individuals as either ADHD or neurotypical with 91.8 percent accuracy, using only about 3 percent of the total features. The sensitivity (the algorithm’s ability to correctly identify ADHD participants) was over 96 percent, while its specificity (the ability to correctly identify neurotypical individuals) was 87 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The literature largely emphasizes the individual differences among persons with ADHD as a potential indicator of varied causes for the disorder,” Arguin said. “Our findings rather indicate that we can actually classify 100% of our participants into their respective group (i.e. ADHD vs typical development) from their individual data patterns pertaining to perceptual oscillations; thereby pointing to a possibly unique cause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This high classification rate in itself was also rather unexpected. However, at the time we carried out the data analyses, we had already completed a similarly designed project comparing perceptual oscillations across young vs elderly participants with normal cognitive functioning (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1323493" target="_blank"&gt;Lévesque &amp;amp; Arguin, 2024&lt;/a&gt;). In that study too, we found an accuracy of 100% in the classification of individual participants into their respective group based on their patterns of perceptual oscillations. This somewhat contributed to raise our expectations for the outcomes of the ADHD study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined whether the algorithm could tell apart individuals with ADHD who were on stimulant medication from those who were not. Despite the small sample size, the model performed well, achieving 91.3 percent accuracy. It was particularly sensitive to identifying those taking medication, with 100 percent accuracy in that subgroup. Only a few features were needed to make this distinction, suggesting that regular medication use has a measurable effect on the timing of visual processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when the researchers directly compared the classification images of medicated and unmedicated participants with ADHD, they did not find statistically significant differences using traditional statistical methods. However, the machine learning approach was able to detect consistent patterns, indicating that the medication status leaves subtle but consistent traces in the visual processing rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, the findings indicate “that there is a particular pattern to perceptual oscillations that seems to uniquely characterize most, if not all, persons with ADHD,” Arguin explained. “This fact suggests that there may be a single atypical brain mechanism underlying ADHD. This is at variance from a large portion of the relevant literature, which seems to assume a variety of potential causes in attempting to account for sometimes significant individual differences among ADHD sufferers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings are promising, the study has some limitations. The sample size was modest, especially for the comparison between medicated and non-medicated ADHD participants. Larger and more diverse samples are needed to confirm the generalizability of the results. The participants were mostly young adults, so it is not yet clear whether similar patterns would be found in older adults or children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that while the classification method was very effective, the specific link between the observed visual processing patterns and underlying neural mechanisms remains unclear. The classification images are thought to reflect brain oscillations, but this assumption has not yet been directly tested using brain imaging techniques. Future studies could combine this behavioral method with electroencephalography or functional MRI to identify the brain regions and networks involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also point out that the task they used—a repetitive word recognition task with limited cognitive flexibility—may have made it especially sensitive to the effects of ADHD and medication. It remains to be seen whether similar processing differences would appear in more complex or varied tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the findings suggest that random temporal sampling may offer a powerful and objective tool for identifying ADHD. The ability to classify individuals with such high accuracy, based on a brief visual task, suggests that there may be a single core difference in perceptual timing that characterizes the condition. This idea stands in contrast to much of the current literature, which tends to emphasize individual differences and multiple potential causes for ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the technique proves reliable in broader populations and under different testing conditions, it could eventually be adapted into a clinical tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on our investigation in adults with ADHD, we are now pursuing a related study to examine whether we can replicate its findings in children in the age range where an assessment for possible ADHD is most often sought (10-14 year olds),” Arguin explained. “If so, it would indicate that random temporal sampling could constitute an excellent test for the assessment of ADHD. Such a test could eventually prove very useful in the current context where: 1. access to the relevant specialists is often very difficult; 2. assessment for possible ADHD may be very costly; 3. the diagnosis of ADHD is based on symptomatology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310605" target="_blank"&gt;Visual processing oscillates differently through time for adults with ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Pénélope Pelland-Goulet, Martin Arguin, Hélène Brisebois, and Nathalie Gosselin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 15:05:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOU2FFY2o2Qi12cWUwcDRPeXYzRk5DeGxTUklkYTl2OHZwSkVFcXJCRnJyX0hiNUw0ZU1EQUpXU1hZdGVDWHBoNG1sT1NJSUhXS3psSGQ1RE1xSEpkTTQ0WVdoQW1vS2ctd3pLNmVWd3Z5bHFwMzJ5cEdVeDFWM1cwbWZhQnc5WlktU3pyazdQMHhiNmE0bS04bTVfNlgyckZZQmUtN2o5Q05Kc3BNQWhGTQ</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员称，密歇根州东南部被狂犬病蝙蝠咬伤的人- ClickOnDetroit</title><link>https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2025/10/10/person-bitten-by-rabid-bat-in-southeast-michigan/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ST.

It really depends on who you ask. I’m not talking about potentially risky biodefense lab research, but something that doesn’t yet exist: mirror life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here’s a refresher on normal biology: the cells in our bodies are composed of the building blocks of life. Nucleotides and sugars make up our DNA, which provides the blueprint for cells and codes for proteins that carry out key biological functions. In all of life, these biomolecules have a specific “handedness.” (Bear with me here.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A mirror image is possible, the way your left and right hands are mirror images of each other. But mirror life can’t evolve from existing life in nature.

We listen to the A-side, with genetic material made from right-handed nucleotides and proteins composed of left-handed amino acids. Natural life has evolved to only use this configuration. These biomolecules are &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/origin-chiral-biomolecules"&gt;chiral&lt;/a&gt;: they can’t be superimposed on their mirror images. All life uses the same chirality. The hope, and fear, is that the opposite — synthetic life based on left-handed genes and right-handed proteins — exists on the bonus B-side of the record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As &lt;a href="/future-perfect/393048/mirror-life-mirror-bacteria-existential-risk-science-biology-apocalypse"&gt;my former colleague Kelsey Piper explained&lt;/a&gt; back in January, mirror life could represent a whole new way that the world could end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’re at least decades away from being able to create entire mirror cells — that includes bacteria. The technologies that would allow us to do so aren’t yet up to the task. But we’ve &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10628113/"&gt;encountered&lt;/a&gt; mirror biomolecules like right-handed amino acids in nature, and scientists have synthesized mirror enzymes capable of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5470636/#:~:text=Proteins%20composed%20entirely%20of%20unnatural,in%20a%20way%20previously%20unattainable."&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; mirror genes. With the power of chemistry, researchers have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5470636/#:~:text=Proteins%20composed%20entirely%20of%20unnatural,in%20a%20way%20previously%20unattainable."&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; mirror proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These mirror biomolecules are the building blocks of mirror life, but they are not mirror life itself. This distinction is really important, and not only because I’m being pedantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-2327/full"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;last year &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/dec/12/unprecedented-risk-to-life-on-earth-scientists-call-for-halt-on-mirror-life-microbe-research"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/08/31/mirror-life-scientists-push-for-ban/85866520007/"&gt;dramatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/pause-mirror-life/"&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt; after its authors laid out potential catastrophic risks of mirror life. Such risks include the possibility that mirror bacteria would evade our immune systems and lack natural predators, replicating to the point that they threaten to outcompete normal life. The authors concluded that “in the absence of compelling evidence for reassurance, our view is that mirror bacteria and other mirror organisms should not be created.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So if those are the risks, then we definitely shouldn’t pursue the creation of mirror life. Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Well, only if we accept that those &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Something that’s gotten a bit lost in the noise of media coverage is that the 35+ authors — who hail from fields as diverse as ecology, immunology, and synthetic biology — want mirror &lt;em&gt;biomolecule&lt;/em&gt; research to continue. Nearly everyone agrees on that, because mirror biomolecules can offer immense benefits for developing new therapeutics, diagnostics, and studying the biochemistry of life without making new life itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-brief-argument-against-mirror-life" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The (brief) argument against mirror life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But first, let’s get into why the idea of mirror life is so frightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cbs.umn.edu/directory/kate-adamala"&gt;Kate Adamala&lt;/a&gt;, a biochemist building synthetic cells at the University of Minnesota and the lead author of the &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;paper, received a 2019 grant to develop and deploy mirror cells. Upon looking into it further, she decided that the risks far outweighed the benefits, and called for the work to be halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Mirror molecules are safe to make, because unlike mirror bacteria, the molecules don’t replicate, so they don’t pose any risks of spreading uncontrollably,” Adamala told me over email. One of her chief concerns is that normal cells may be unable to recognize mirror cells, because many of our immune mechanisms are based on chirality, or handedness. This could allow mirror cells to “grow unrestrained by the immune system and environmental predators” that keep normal cells in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The collapse of entire ecosystems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The inability to develop robust medical countermeasures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The possibility that mirror bacteria would be completely resistant to predation by other microbes that prey on bacteria and keep their population under control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It’s hard to overstate how severe these risks could be,” Ruslan Medzhitov, an immunologist at Yale University and one of the paper’s co-authors, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/leading-scientists-urge-ban-developing-mirror-image-bacteria"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Science News. “If mirror bacteria were to spread through infected animals and plants, much of the planet’s many environments could be contaminated. …Any exposure to contaminated dust or soil could be fatal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We could see a mass extinction event, an existential threat to multicellular life as we know it. Effective biocontainment, the researchers argue, would be incredibly difficult. If you have the time, it’s worth reading the 299-page &lt;a href="https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:cv716pj4036/Technical%20Report%20on%20Mirror%20Bacteria%20Feasibility%20and%20Risks.pdf"&gt;technical report&lt;/a&gt; that explains how the study authors came to their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That said, mirror life could offer real benefits. Mirror therapeutics, which wouldn’t be recognized by our digestive enzymes, have the potential to last a lot longer in our bodies, opening up new possibilities for the treatment of chronic disease. Right now, we create mirror therapeutics chemically, putting them together atom by atom. Mirror bacteria could do this for us, and at a much greater speed, &lt;a href="https://attheu.utah.edu/health-medicine/mirror-life/"&gt;allowing&lt;/a&gt; us to produce mirror therapeutics en masse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Synthetic biology and synthetic chemistry are relatively small fields, and mirror biology is even smaller. The declarations of a scientific consensus around mirror life may be premature, but a growing number of voices are getting involved in discussions on the possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I want to make it very clear that right now, mirror life is only a possibility. And it might be more distant than we think. &lt;a href="https://www.chem.ubc.ca/david-perrin"&gt;David Perrin&lt;/a&gt;, a synthetic chemist at the University of British Columbia, told me over email that science is nowhere close to creating a living mirror cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;He is also skeptical that mirror bacteria would be toxic to normal life, and believes our immune systems would likely be able to neutralize them after all. Immune responses are complex, and not all rely on handedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The scale of the threat is unclear, because mirror organisms might be hopelessly outcompeted by regular life. By creating a second tree of life, we might create a second evolutionary arms race, with mirror life on the losing side. Mirror organisms might struggle to find food they need to proliferate. Or not — evolution is a funny thing — but at this point there’s no way to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The more I think about this, the more I realize that the real concern ought to be with creating life on this side of the mirror,” Perrin told me. Trying to shut down work on creating mirror life “makes no sense. …What would have happened if we put a total moratorium on researching radioactivity? We wouldn’t know anything about RNA. And we wouldn’t have any radioactive treatments for cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;He thinks that red lines can be drawn — when people come closer to actually generating mirror life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/gigi-kwik-gronvall"&gt;Gigi Gronvall&lt;/a&gt;, an immunologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and biosecurity expert at Johns Hopkins University, told Science News that the paper’s concerns were very theoretical. While she strongly supports the authors’ advocacy for discussion around the issue, she thinks that any proposed funding and research ban “puts the cart before the horse” and could impede research leading to surprising scientific advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We don’t fully understand the risks of mirror life, and we won’t without more research. But this research could be purely &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gch2.202500051"&gt;computational&lt;/a&gt;, allowing us to assess the nature of potential threats without posing real biological risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Creating mirror life could help us &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/why-are-all-proteins-left-handed-new-theory-could-solve-origin-of-life-mystery"&gt;understand&lt;/a&gt; the origins of life and why it evolved in the direction that it did. I’d be lying if I didn’t say that the idea of a second tree of life, side B of the biological recording, is really cool. That’s not to say that we shouldn’t be worried about potential risks here. This is completely new territory, and it might not remain the stuff of science fiction forever. But there is a debate to be had, and more evidence may emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And we really do need these discussions. I’m glad that the Mirror Biology Dialogues Fund is &lt;a href="https://www.mbdialogues.org/events"&gt;hosting&lt;/a&gt; events to facilitate them. It’s unusual to have the opportunity to proactively shape biotech governance well before the technology becomes a real possibility. Certainly, there’s more to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxQQjM5bGhKeVVtdmdnTlZkSWRhNTZFOFdQOUxadm9ka0dSMzJSOFFLOTZSX0RHQVNxbmVaajVuQ1dGaEtnWFRPV003T2pxTjJzZmRacVl0NW5VcS1HczM1eko5VkNnNjQtcDRxYmE2WmEzb0pUemw5ay0xR1RHU0RvdDVuSmdINXB0S1V1S2RqVEF3OEFXdU9tOC1mVzJYaHc</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.的下一个疫苗目标- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/10/10/rfk-vaccine-aluminum-trump-ban</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 12:16:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBkSEgyOWpqSXRCUXJ3el9uTGYtckdNamJMVTFQN1NFekttRlZqWmlKdTZ5c0N0SjFDd0FNTWZOYnpEM212bDEtWmt3a3VreVU0d1hCSG1nNDNVY0llNEFZNmcwN2l2X1FKNmw4bVBhb0M</guid></item><item><title>美国各地的麻疹疫情继续增加病例数- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/health/measles-outbreaks-utah-arizona-south-carolina</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A deadly measles outbreak in Texas &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak-declared-over"&gt;ended in August&lt;/a&gt;, but outbreaks in other parts of the United States continue to add hundreds of new measles cases to this year’s record national total.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00043b6nnvd0clai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been an average of 27 new measles cases reported each week since the end of August, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The annual total – now up to 1,563 cases since January – is the highest by a significant margin since measles was declared eliminated in the US a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk2wqse00003b6qwyafchyu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s a &lt;a href="https://newalbanyohio.org/news/2025/10/confirmed-case-of-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;new outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Ohio, a recent &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles100125.html" target="_blank"&gt;surge&lt;/a&gt; in cases in Minnesota and more than 150 unvaccinated schoolchildren in South Carolina are in quarantine because of an ongoing outbreak there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00053b6nah7gqtko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before this year, the US had recorded only 10 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coca/media/pdfs/2025/COCA-Call-Slides_09.11.25_Combined-FINALV2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;large measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; – defined by the CDC as more than 50 related cases – since reaching elimination status in 2000. But an ongoing outbreak along the border between Arizona and Utah is already the third large outbreak this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00063b6nj94nfg7j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been more than 90 confirmed cases related to the outbreak – at least 59 in Arizona and 36 in Utah, according to state health departments – and case counts continue to grow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00073b6n46rmcqik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist in Utah, said there is still a lot of opportunity for measles to continue to spread in the area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00083b6ncg2sv3sz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, I think we still have quite a while to go with infections. We know that most of our infections have been localized down towards the southern end of our state, but I think we are starting to see now people get infected even at the very north end of our state,” she said. “So I do think that this is going to continue to bop around and spread in different communities. I suspect we’re in the middle of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00093b6n10jfaug5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say that any amount of measles spread is cause for concern, and large outbreaks highlight the dangers of declining vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000a3b6nlu1h1mqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you have multiple cases happening, particularly with those numbers, it’s only possible because you have susceptible individuals,” said Dr. Scott Harris, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000b3b6n688f1ofb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are measles cases in the US every year, often introduced via international travel, Harris said. But those cases can really multiply only if they’re happening among other people who are unvaccinated – and can multiply at large scale only if large parts of a community are unvaccinated. The Texas outbreak is evidence of this, he said, with state health department &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; showing that 97% of its cases were among people who had not gotten one or both of the recommended two vaccine doses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000c3b6njfq9do4u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The story here is: Parents of young children are skeptical about vaccination,” Harris said. “There are lots of reasons why, but if that weren’t the case, this wouldn’t be a story, because we wouldn’t have these outbreaks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000d3b6nqo077tda@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A record share of US kindergartners had an exemption for a required vaccination in the last school year, and coverage for all reported vaccines – including the measles vaccine – continued on a downward trend, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk0lj6q00073b6qkahyoz2b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coverage with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine dropped to 92.5%, the latest data shows. Because measles is such a highly contagious disease, public health experts say that at least 95% MMR coverage is needed to prevent spread. Last year marks the fifth year in a row that coverage has been below that target.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgkqhkbe00003b6niazx1wvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Utah, Nolen says that public health officials have a good grasp on where measles is spreading thanks to wastewater monitoring that can capture virus levels beyond official case counts, and where the risk is elevated due to low vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgkqowk600063b6n86q7r31d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In those areas, we try to work with the local health department and the community to get the word out that we know that there is measles in their area and that we really encourage families to consider getting vaccines,” she said. Misinformation has created some vaccine hesitancy, she said, but vaccination rates have ticked up as awareness about the current outbreak has grown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000e3b6nfk2w2ta5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A separate ongoing outbreak in South Carolina also threatens to grow quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000f3b6nfvnzppuo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 150 unvaccinated children are in quarantine after measles exposures at two schools in the northern part of the state, one public elementary school and one public charter school in Spartanburg County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000g3b6n9gi39iyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those schools are following the protocols to exclude these students until the period of potential disease transmission has safely ended,” Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist, said Thursday. “Those students are identified as having been exposed and not having been vaccinated, and that’s the reason for the exclusion.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000h3b6n7tgrk0ld@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 90% of people who have been exposed to measles and do not have immune protection from vaccination could get infected, Bell said, and “worst-case scenario” would be that rate of infection among the at-risk students who are being closely monitored for symptoms while in quarantine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000i3b6nm2ilcov6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been 11 confirmed measles cases in South Carolina this year, including seven associated with the Spartanburg County outbreak since September 25, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdph.sc.gov%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Finfectious-diseases%2Fviruses-parasites-bacterial-infections%2Fmeasles-rubeola%2F2025&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeidre.McPhillips%40cnn.com%7Ccf54477b5bb445823b7108de076c3305%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638956358682558291%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=SKMKDLZxmtHJsEinaRbgQpFMfnUegLGeorSRI9Uvpgk%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;according to the state health department&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000j3b6nt177sdu0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spartanburg County has one of the lowest school vaccination rates in the state, according to &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdph.sc.gov%2Fhealth-wellness%2Fchild-teen-health%2Fschool-vaccination-coverage-data%2Fschool-vaccination-coverage-and&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeidre.McPhillips%40cnn.com%7Ccf54477b5bb445823b7108de076c3305%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638956358682582140%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=qgZ8%2FHacZhsiUkvcIbGmx2FOA4QM%2FSkkgllcqI%2B7dlw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department. Last school year, less than 90% of school students there received their required immunizations, which includes two doses of the MMR vaccine. School vaccination coverage has been falling in Spartanburg County for years, as it has across the state and nationwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000k3b6nuyecv3fk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A measles case reported Thursday in Greenville County, South Carolina’s most populous county, is being investigated for a possible link to the Spartanburg outbreak. But the state health department is not aware of any other potentially related cases in other states or jurisdictions, Bell said Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000l3b6nb43ydux3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s “incredibly expensive and demanding” for local health departments to respond to measles threats, said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The organization has worked with health departments from across the country to help them learn from their experiences responding to measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000m3b6n8jblw2io@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Health departments are already stretched thin by budget constraints and staff attrition. Adding measles outbreaks to their workload is draining the reserves of even the best-resourced departments,” Rivers said. “It’s been hard to understand from the outside what supports the federal government is offering to local responders.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000n3b6n0l3t04qp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC has continued to update its measles tracker during the federal government shutdown, even as other surveillance data systems have come to a halt. And local health leaders say they have continued to stay in contact with CDC experts, although they have been warned that response times may be a bit slower.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000o3b6nf75iv9yj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Due to a lapse in federal funding, CDC has developed an orderly shutdown plan, ensuring critical public health and safety functions continue without interruption. As found in the plan, CDC and [the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry] would collect data being reported by states, hospitals, and others, and report out critical information needed for state and local health authorities and providers to track, prevent and treat diseases,” according to a statement from the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000p3b6nzvf2h6s5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But federal surveillance systems are far from perfect, and experts say that formally reported measles cases in the US are probably a significant undercount, with some estimating that this year’s total could be closer to 5,000 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000q3b6ndkruzg2t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Current measles outbreak trends are “consistent with an undervaccinated population,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has exacerbated problems with both disease surveillance and vaccination rates, he said, by cutting federal health agency workers and failing to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment"&gt;fully endorse&lt;/a&gt; the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000r3b6nvloqs722@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re in the midst of a measles epidemic,” Offit said. “We should have an administration that stands up clearly and definitively and holds press conferences saying, ‘Vaccinate your children. These are preventable illnesses.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk0uubm00003b6qhkfvzpga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000t3b6njojkbq7c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trust in federal health leadership has suffered under Kennedy, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/rfk-approval-cdc-trust-vaccines-kff"&gt;a new poll shows&lt;/a&gt;, with most US adults saying they disapprove of the way he’s handled vaccine policy and his role as health secretary overall.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the journal &lt;i&gt;Childhood in the Past&lt;/i&gt;, Ph.D. candidate Duru Yağmur Başaran &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17585716.2025.2555855" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the results of an analysis of an over 900-year-old skeleton of a child. The study revealed that a 2.5 to 3.5-year-old child had suffered from a rare disease seldom seen in archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Excavated from the archaeological site of Aphrodisias, located in southwestern Türkiye, the remains were recovered in 1985 from the site of Tetrapylon Cemetery, dated to around the 10th–12th century, placing it firmly in the Middle Byzantine period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grave, labeled "Tomb 73A" (S-TET-II-85 Tomb 73A), contained the remains of two non-adults, including children 73A and B. Skeleton 73A exhibited unusual skeletal deformations, including thickening and swelling of various bone elements, including parts of the child's jaw, shoulder blade, and shafts of the left arm bones. The left ulna (lower arm bone) in particular had swollen to nearly double its usual size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the remains revealed the child to be around 3 years old, although there was a discrepancy between the estimated age based on the long bones (1.5–2 years) and the teeth (2.5–3.5 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to determine what disease could have caused these deformities, several diseases and their characteristics were compared to the skeletal remains of the Aphrodisias child. These illnesses included hemolytic anemias, scurvy, rickets, tuberculosis, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/child+abuse/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;child abuse&lt;/a&gt;, and infantile cortical hyperostosis (ICH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, many of these diseases did not quite match the deformities observed on the bones of the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the list of diseases, the Aphrodisias child showed the greatest resemblance to ICH, also known as Caffey disease. This &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/rare+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rare disease&lt;/a&gt; usually develops in early infancy and affects various skeletal elements and surrounding connective tissues. It typically develops around 5 months of age, though it can present itself as early as birth and even in utero. Interestingly, the disease normally also resolves itself around age three, though it may recur in rare cases.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the Aphrodisias child showed early signs of recovery just before its death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease is characterized by asymmetrical thickening of bone caused by the inflammation of the periosteum (the membrane covering bones), which leads to new bone layers being deposited. The disease most commonly affects the jaw, forearm (ulna), shin bone, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/collar+bone/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;collar bone&lt;/a&gt;, shoulder blade, and ribs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that this disease may have contributed to the discrepancy between the age estimate in the bones and teeth, as bones are more susceptible to environmental stressors such as malnutrition. Such factors are likely to occur, especially in ICH, as it affects the jaw, making it difficult to feed children suffering from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aphrodisias child is one of only a handful of known archaeological ICH cases. In fact, the disease, including its cause and the reasons for resolving itself, remains difficult to diagnose even in modern clinical settings. However, some known symptoms include fever, irritability, thickening of the bones, and swelling of the overlying soft tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease seems to develop sporadically and disappear spontaneously, although some familial cases have been reported, indicating there may be some hereditary factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Ph.D. candidate Başaran, it is unclear if the child died from ICH, "Unfortunately, the cause of death cannot be determined in most cases where we only have skeletonized remains. It is possible that the individual passed away from ICH, complications that arose from ICH, or a completely unrelated matter."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case contributes to our understanding of non-adult health in Middle Byzantine Aphrodisias. Additionally, the addition of this case to the record of known ICH cases in archaeology contributes to developing a more refined and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/reliable+method/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;reliable method&lt;/a&gt; of diagnosing the disease in historic and prehistoric contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Americans say that given the choice, they &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/views-and-experiences-with-end-of-life-medical-care-in-the-us-findings/#:~:text=As%20other%20research%20has%20shown,nursing%20home%20(1%20percent)." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;would prefer to die at home&lt;/a&gt;, but about &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15090940/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;1 in 5&lt;/a&gt; deaths in the U.S. occur after admission to an intensive care unit. In the book “&lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=2986930&amp;amp;m=97137&amp;amp;afftrack=64273215e4b02a8d518e9b1f&amp;amp;urllink=bookshop.org%2Fbooks%2Fextreme-measures-finding-a-better-path-to-the-end-of-life%2F9780525533412" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Extreme Measures: Finding a Better Path to the End of Life&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Jessica Zitter details what she calls the “end-of-life conveyor belt” — a type of care in which dying ICU patients receive painful treatments to be kept at alive at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, by the time someone is on the conveyor belt, it’s often too late to talk to them about what they want. And then everybody is trying to play catch-up. And it’s hard to get it right when the chips are down and there’s so much emotion,” said Zitter, who specializes in palliative medicine and critical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So my recommendation is to talk about these issues early on in life, maybe starting when you become an adult. Start to think about your mortality, and visualize how you would want things to go for you when you get into that stage of life, the end stage. Communicate honestly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filling out forms for so-called advance care planning goes a long way. But “it’s as important that you, number one, identify a person you trust — or two or three [people] — that can honor your wishes,” Sethi said, “and have the conversations ahead of time, before you’re in the state where you can’t communicate your needs and wishes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some hospice workers recommended &lt;a href="https://www.fivewishes.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Five Wishes&lt;/a&gt;, an advance care planning program, as one way to get clarity on how you want things to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan recommended playing a card game called &lt;a href="https://codaalliance.org/go-wish/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;GoWish&lt;/a&gt; with a friend, a partner or someone else you hope will follow your end-of-life wishes. “[The cards] have different statements on them about possibilities of what you might want or not want,” she said. “And you make stacks of the ones that you like, the ones that you know you don’t care about, and the ones that you’re not sure about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone playing the game may find it difficult to choose which cards represent their values, which is why Morgan suggests having two people play together, so that it can be a conversation starter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that there is no one right way to die, and preferences may differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are people who feel that every moment of life is precious and that they value the length of life over the quality of life,” Eichholz-Heller said. “So they are willing to endure a certain amount of suffering to be able to be kept alive. Then there are other people who value quality of life over length of life. And they would rather focus on comfort, even if it means that they won’t live as long.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are still a lot of negative associations with hospice care, even though it can be helpful. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a difference between palliative care and hospice. Palliative care workers help to make patients comfortable at any stage of their life if they’re suffering; hospice is a medical service specifically for people with a short-term life expectancy. While anyone living with a serious illness can seek palliative care, Medicare will help cover hospice care costs for people in the U.S. if their health care provider certifies that they are terminally ill and have &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/Hospice" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;six months or less&lt;/a&gt; to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people wrongfully assume that going into hospice automatically shortens the life of a patient. Smith said she has been called a murderer for working in hospice care, adding that the worst myth about hospice workers is that they kill their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People think that when you go on hospice, it’s a death sentence and that death is imminent,” Smith said. She cited former President Jimmy Carter, who &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/former-president-jimmy-carter-enters-hospice-care-charity_n_63f13659e4b0c87f32f1a4f2" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780"&gt;entered&lt;/a&gt; hospice care in February and is still alive today, as one prominent example of how that is not always the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, research shows that seeking palliative care at an early point can improve quality of life. &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1000678" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Published&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, one study on advanced lung cancer patients found that offering early palliative care on an outpatient or ambulatory basis led to fewer clinically significant depressive symptoms and a longer median survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When patients are suffering, they use so much of their energy just to fight the suffering that if we can make them comfortable, they sort of stabilize,” Eichholz-Heller said. “And a lot of times, it really helps them to live longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospices can differ in their approach to care and the additional services they offer. There are resources that can help you figure out &lt;a href="https://americanhospice.org/learning-about-hospice/choosing-a-hospice-16-questions-to-ask/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;the right questions to ask&lt;/a&gt; to select the best hospice for you or a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can’t control death. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;span class="subbuzz__number"&gt;9.&lt;/span&gt;
    

    
      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I was diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9357-crohns-disease" target="_blank"&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 after over a year of significant pain and major GI problems. I was hospitalized more than once during this year and was referred to a GI doctor in my area. He gave me several reasons for the immense pain I was in: First was that my seat belt probably flung back and hit me, causing a bruise (I didn’t have any bruising). When I told him it was not just pain but that I was also physically sick after eating, he said, 'Well, eat less pizza and drink less beer, and you'll be fine.' It was almost every meal, but sure."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"He referred me for an endoscopy, told me that nothing was wrong, and that sometimes people just have abdominal pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many months of trying to be taken seriously, I switched doctors. With only one test, the new doctor diagnosed me with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease and began a treatment plan that had me in remission within a year. I still manage my Crohn’s with the treatment plan he started a decade ago. When I left that area, I wish I could’ve brought him with me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That first doctor, though, fully dismissed my pain as the naive ranting of a 'girl' in her 20s. I’ve never felt so belittled by someone who was supposed to be a caregiver."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous, 38, Buffalo, NY&lt;/p&gt;

Back in the days before we had endless ways to communicate—when we all had landlines—my mom called my Nana every Wednesday, and my dad usually called his parents every Tuesday or Thursday … I can’t quite remember. But having a scheduled time helps make it a routine and a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

Your husband’s family might just need a new cruise director.&lt;/p&gt;

It can be so hard to get your head around the fact that biological pregnancy is not going to work. But as someone going through IVF myself, let me say: the LW has not been paying attention to the details if she thinks having sex with Manny one time is going to solve her problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32k002n3b6imtpfpy0k@published"&gt;Did the doctor definitively say that the reason conception has failed is her husband’s sperm? Does she know with certainty that she has numerous viable eggs that can fertilize unassisted? Does she know that her ovulation cycle is predictable and healthy?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32l002o3b6iavnh5p9c@published"&gt;The LW was likely told that the probability of natural pregnancy per menstrual cycle is around&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11585-conception"&gt; 25 percent&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s if she’s in her 20s and there are no other health impediments for her or her husband. This probability&lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/having-a-baby-after-age-35-how-aging-affects-fertility-and-pregnancy"&gt; drops precipitously&lt;/a&gt; with age.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32l002p3b6iio2t5ufx@published"&gt;This is not to discourage people who are &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/09/rapamycin-fertility-ovarian-reserve-menopause-antiaging-skepticism.html"&gt;trying to conceive&lt;/a&gt;—I’m in that precipitously dropping probability group, and &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/08/fertility-cliff-advanced-maternal-age-outdated.html"&gt;thank goodness for modern medicine&lt;/a&gt;! But it is noticeable to me that she has gone through IVF and not had a successful pregnancy, so she has been educated on the small probabilities we’re dealing with, and the likelihood that even with the best medicine has to offer, it’s not going to happen. And she and her husband are still thinking there might be a good reason to try this plan, which has seemingly &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/01/mychart-patient-portal-fertility-journey-pregnancy-anxiety.html"&gt;infinite ways&lt;/a&gt; it can go wrong … and only one minuscule way it can go right?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32l002q3b6idqprkep7@published"&gt;That either means there’s more going on here—as you suggested, maybe she or her husband is looking for an excuse for her to have sex with Manny. In that case, DO NOT get a child involved. But more worrying to me is the likelihood that she, her husband, or both have not really understood and processed the IVF failure. There is almost no reason to think she will get pregnant naturally from sleeping with Manny once. The fact that she or her husband think it’s that easy, despite everything they have already learned and experienced, means they need to spend time working through the disappointment and grief that come with accepting that biological children are not in their future. The effort to process, grieve, heal, and move forward as a family should be the focus—not cockamamie schemes that may only damage the marriage more and simply delay the pain of infertility.&lt;/p&gt;

And you make a good point about the fact that they’ve already tried IVF. Sperm quality is definitely something they check out during that process, so the couple should really know definitively, beyond “it looks as though the doctors [who predicted that he wouldn’t be able to conceive when he was a child] were correct.” We have updated information! Anyway, I don’t want to get too far into the medical details, even though those of us who’ve been throughIVF should really have some kind of honorary degree in fertility medicine. Suffice it to say, the answer to “Could this really be the solution we’ve been looking for?” is “probably not.”&lt;/p&gt;

Certainly, romantic love can be important to some, but I only have one person in my life who loves me that way (my husband) and a dozen or more people who love me in a friendship way. I wonder if seeking out a chosen family might help fill this void. Perhaps you could start with fellow adoptees. There’s a lot of discussion about adopted children who went through exactly what you’ve experienced and I bet you would vibe with some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

No detail is too small. Take your time—spend a week or more on it. When you can’t think of one more thing, go through the list and pick out the 10 or 12 most important items. Again, take your time and consider carefully. Once you have locked that down, order the list. Put the most important first, and write them out from first to last. Read it often. If you go out to a bar, read the list before you go. If you go on a weekend singles adventure, make it your purpose to open your heart and get to know everyone.

But perhaps you could also remind the LW that her mother is a fully formed adult who still has desires and needs. No one wants to think of their parents as sexual beings (eww), but the LW seemed to give her dad a pass for his behavior while sort of condemning her mom for her new boobs. There is nothing wrong with wanting to feel attractive at any age, and it’s not necessarily a sign of dementia. The LW should give some grace to her mom—and stay out of it with her sisters.&lt;/p&gt;

The one thing that really bothers me is that she’s jealous of people in our field who are successful. Anytime someone we know, or a random person that has a similar age to us, is remotely successful, she gets jealous. She’ll say things like “why isn’t that me” or just “ugh” and sigh. It’s making me more and more annoyed as time goes on and I notice it more. Of course, I also worry that she will direct that at me and I don’t need that in my life. I’ve been hesitant to tell her when I get job interviews or offers because I don’t know if she’s honest in her “congratulations!” &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/12/ratted-out-custodian-stealing-food-coworkers-hate-me-dear-prudence-advice.html"&gt;What do I do? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On average, individuals consume between 39,000 and 52,000 particles annually, with bottled water drinkers taking in an additional 90,000 microplastic fragments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And whilst the European Food Safety Agency maintains that most microplastics are excreted by the body, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation have warned that some particles could enter the bloodstream and lodge in vital organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A growing body of evidence has linked them to neurotoxicity, chronic inflammation and disruption of hormones and metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15169729/dangerous-chemicals-bottled-water-bowel-cancer-microplastics.html"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, led by Sara Sajedi, a leading environmental management expert at Concordia University, found that people who regularly drink bottled water—consumed before its expiration date—consume around 900,000 more microplastic particles each year than those who drink tap water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sajedi described the health risks posed by single-use plastic bottles as 'serious', and called for greater awareness of what she described as a 'pressing issue.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Microplastics can also contribute to intestinal dysbiosis, disrupt the balance of gut bacteria, and may lead to respiratory diseases when inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These wide-ranging chronic health risks highlight the importance of recognising and addressing the impact of nano- and microplastics to safeguard human health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are also concerned that drinking bottled water after its best-before-date has passed could make it unpalatable, as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) particles break down over time, affecting the taste and smell of the water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, PET particles are not thought to contain chemicals that are harmful to our health, like phthalates or BPA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts say you can cut your exposure to microplastics by swapping out plastics in your home for natural materials, metal and glass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But if plastic bottles are stored in hot environments, exposed to sunlight or stored beside strong smelling chemicals, the quality of the plastic may degrade more quickly and taint the water inside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PET plastics are also breathable, meaning that overtime small amounts of water can evaporate out of the bottle—making room for contaminated particles to enter the source directly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes after &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15167137/Microplastics-risk-bowel-cancer-depression-human-study.html"&gt;shocking research earlier this week suggested microplastics used in food packaging may be damaging the gut&lt;/a&gt;—raising the risk of bowel cancer and depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The discovery was made by Australian researchers who examined stool samples from healthy volunteers and found that microplastic particles could alter microbial activity in the gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the changes mirrored patterns previously linked to depression and bowel cancer, suggesting the tiny fragments may disrupt the body's internal balance in ways that affect both physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts called the findings 'significant', saying it was the first human study to show microplastics can alter the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Now, a person can live as long a life as anyone else, despite having HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drugs were also invented to lower an HIV-negative person's risk of contracting the virus by 99%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In recent years, research has shown that ART can suppress HIV to such an extent that it makes the virus untransmittable to sexual partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That has spurred a movement to downgrade the crime of infecting a person with HIV: it leaves the victim on life-long, costly medication, but it does not mean certain death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Here is more about the new life-saving and preventative drugs: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium"&gt;1. Drugs for HIV-positive people &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;It suppresses their viral load so the virus is untransmittable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 1996, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) was discovered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug, a triple combination, turned HIV from a fatal diagnosis to a manageable chronic condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It suppresses the virus, preventing it from developing into AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), which makes the body unable to withstand infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After six months of religiously taking the daily pill, it suppresses the virus to such an extent that it's undetectable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And once a person's viral load is undetectable, they cannot transmit HIV to anyone else, according to scores of studies including a decade-long study by the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/undetectable-equals-untransmittable"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Public health bodies around the world now acknowledge that U=U (undetectable equals untransmittable).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium"&gt;2. Drugs for HIV-negative people &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;It is 99% effective at preventing HIV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) became available in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This pill works like '&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;the &lt;/span&gt;pill' - it is taken daily and is 99 percent effective at preventing HIV infection (more effective than the contraceptive pill is at preventing pregnancy). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It consists of two medicines (tenofovir dosproxil fumarate and emtricitabine). Those medicines can mount an immediate attack on any trace of HIV that enters the person's bloodstream, before it is able to spread throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 08:20:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>“种植向日葵的处方如何帮助我对抗厌食症” -

It's time to seriously fund prevention and opportunities for people to create good health in the neighbourhoods where they live and work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The national pilot scheme saw nearly 8,500 people prescribed nature activities in its first two years, with more than half those patients living in socio-economically deprived areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Chris Dayson, professor of voluntary action, health and wellbeing at Sheffield Hallam University, who was part of the team that evaluated the scheme, said it brought "a really statistically significant increase in wellbeing" for patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The evaluation also found the scheme brought an economic social return - not least of all by getting people back into work - of £2.42 for every £1 invested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;When approached by the BBC, the government did not comment on the future of green social prescribing but said the evaluation of the second two years of the trial scheme would be published "in due course".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;'Dramatic results'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Although green social prescribing is designed to complement, not replace, conventional medical treatments and therapies, there are some who fear it does not deal with the bigger social health issues around mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Rob Poole, professor of social psychiatry at the Centre for Mental Health and Society, said that, while he was not against green social prescribing, it was an "inadequate response to the social determinants of health, such as poor housing, poverty and deterioration in social infrastructure".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"These are not lifestyle choices. They cannot be addressed by time-limited interventions, no matter how much better green activity makes you feel in the short run," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But Shannon Kang, an NHS health and wellbeing coach at the University Medical Practice in Birmingham, who has recently been trained in nature prescribing by the RSPB, said she had seen "dramatic results" - with patients' anxiety and stress levels reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For Ms Hough, getting in touch with the natural world has been life-changing: "I was sceptical.

While topical minoxidil is an approved therapy, its limited ability to dissolve in water and penetrate the skin reduces its effectiveness. Researchers reporting in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/em&gt; have found that stevioside, a natural sweetener extracted from the Stevia plant, can help improve how well the drug is absorbed through the skin.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;&lt;p data-start="510" data-end="730"&gt;In tests using a mouse model of alopecia, a dissolvable patch containing both stevioside and minoxidil successfully stimulated hair follicles to re-enter the growth phase, which resulted in the development of new hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using stevioside to enhance minoxidil delivery represents a promising step toward more effective and natural treatments for hair loss, potentially benefiting millions worldwide," said co-corresponding author Lifeng Kang, PhD, of the University of Sydney, in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Androgenetic alopecia develops gradually over time and is influenced by both genetic and hormonal factors. The condition occurs when hair follicles become increasingly sensitive to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone derived from testosterone. This sensitivity causes the follicles to shrink, leading to shorter and finer strands of hair until growth eventually stops. Although the pattern and progression differ between men and women, the biological mechanism is similar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Currently, treatment options are limited, with minoxidil being one of the few widely approved topical therapies. Minoxidil works by widening blood vessels and increasing blood flow around hair follicles, which can extend the growth phase of the hair cycle and stimulate new strands to develop. However, because the drug does not easily pass through the outer layer of skin and dissolves poorly in water, its full potential is often not realized. Patients must apply it consistently for several months before seeing results, and even then, the response varies from person to person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This challenge has driven researchers to explore new ways of improving how minoxidil is delivered to the scalp. Enhancing the drug’s skin permeability could make treatments more efficient, reduce application frequency, and possibly lower side effects related to overuse. The discovery that stevioside can act as a natural absorption enhancer offers a new direction for scientists seeking to improve both the safety and effectiveness of hair loss therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer tracking-[.02em] pt-2 font-normal"&gt;Our expert notes that if you are experiencing joint pain, it’s important to seek medical guidance before beginning any type of exercise. “Once cleared to participate, dynamic stretching with mat Pilates-inspired movements can be an excellent way to help reduce discomfort and improve mobility,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;

It can lubricate the joints, warm up the muscles, and stretch out any stiff areas that might be causing your pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dynamic stretching through mat Pilates is an excellent way to counter muscle weakness and imbalances, postural dysfunction and poor movement mechanics, and overcome a sedentary lifestyle,” explains Drummond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GYzvU36oViQoJuUznZ3hmS" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GYzvU36oViQoJuUznZ3hmS slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are Drummond’s top five exercises to help with any joint pain you may be experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-dynamic-inner-thigh-and-it-band-circle-stretch" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-dynamic-inner-thigh-and-it-band-circle-stretch"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

							&lt;p data-start="339" data-end="395"&gt;Getting older doesn’t automatically mean slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="397" data-end="539"&gt;Sure, your body changes, but aging well isn’t about defying time—it’s about maintaining function, flexibility, and strength where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="541" data-end="731"&gt;And here’s the thing: when we talk about fitness after 60, most people focus on how much they can lift or how fast they can walk. But there’s a better measure—the quality of your movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="733" data-end="1022"&gt;If you’re 65 (or even approaching it) and can still do these eight movements, your body is performing far better than you might realize. These aren’t “gym exercises.” They’re the daily-life movements that reflect how well your muscles, joints, and nervous system are still communicating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1047" data-end="1108"&gt;1) You can squat down and get back up without holding on&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1110" data-end="1209"&gt;This might seem basic, but it’s one of the strongest indicators of overall mobility and strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1211" data-end="1458"&gt;Being able to squat to the ground and stand back up without grabbing onto a chair, countertop, or your knees means your glutes, quads, and core are still firing in harmony. Those muscles form your foundation—they keep you stable and independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1460" data-end="1637"&gt;Try it sometime. Lower yourself down slowly and rise back up without momentum. That smooth, controlled movement is proof that your brain and body are still a coordinated team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1639" data-end="1952"&gt;I once met a 72-year-old yoga teacher in Santa Cruz who could drop into a full deep squat and hold it while chatting like it was no big deal. When I asked her how she kept that ability, she said, “I never stopped doing it.” That’s it. You don’t preserve mobility by talking about it—you preserve it by using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1954" data-end="2120"&gt;So if you can still squat comfortably, your joints are tracking well, your muscles are strong, and your nervous system is sharp. That’s not luck—that’s consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2127" data-end="2185"&gt;2) You can balance on one leg for at least 10 seconds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2187" data-end="2251"&gt;Balance might be the most underrated marker of physical youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2253" data-end="2391"&gt;Stand on one leg and count to ten. No wobbling, no touching down. If you can do that, you’re doing better than most people in their 40s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2393" data-end="2648"&gt;Why does this matter so much? Because balance is about more than not falling—it’s a direct reflection of your brain’s communication with your muscles and joints. It shows your reflexes and proprioception (your body’s sense of position) are still strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2650" data-end="2857"&gt;I remember watching older locals in Bali carry buckets of water barefoot across rocky paths without a single stumble. They weren’t gym-goers—they just used their bodies in balance-demanding ways every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2859" data-end="2985"&gt;So if you can still balance on one leg for a full ten seconds—or longer—you’re not just steady. You’re neurologically sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2987" data-end="3159"&gt;And yes, you can train this at any age. Start by standing on one leg while brushing your teeth. Balance, like strength, is a skill that responds beautifully to attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3166" data-end="3228"&gt;3) You can get up from the floor without using your hands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3230" data-end="3282"&gt;This one might be the truest test of independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3284" data-end="3495"&gt;If you can sit down on the floor and get back up again without using your hands, knees, or furniture for support, your body’s doing great. It means your core, hips, and coordination are still working together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3497" data-end="3792"&gt;There’s real research behind it. In a study of over 2,000 adults aged 51–80, those able to &lt;a href="https://geriatrictoolkit.missouri.edu/srff/deBrito-Floor-Rise-Mortality-2012..pdf?.com"&gt;“sit and rise”&lt;/a&gt; with minimal support had significantly lower mortality risk over the subsequent years.  Sounds dramatic—but it makes sense. Mobility and survival are closely linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3794" data-end="3956"&gt;I’ve seen people half that age struggle to stand up from a seated position without using their hands. It’s not about fitness level—it’s about movement literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3958" data-end="4079"&gt;If you can do this, it’s not just your muscles thanking you—it’s your nervous system, your joints, and your confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4086" data-end="4129"&gt;4) You can reach overhead without pain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4131" data-end="4196"&gt;Shoulder mobility tells a lot about how well your body’s aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4198" data-end="4373"&gt;Being able to lift your arms straight overhead—without arching your back, shrugging your shoulders, or wincing—shows that your joints and connective tissue are still supple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4375" data-end="4602"&gt;If that movement feels easy, it means you’re keeping good posture, maintaining shoulder rotation, and preserving functional range. That’s crucial, because the shoulder is one of the most injury-prone joints in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4604" data-end="4777"&gt;Think about it: every time you hang up clothes, grab something from a high shelf, or put on a jacket, you’re using that range. Lose it, and everyday life starts to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4779" data-end="4970"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before in another post: strength and flexibility aren’t opposites—they’re partners. A mobile shoulder doesn’t just help you move—it helps you move powerfully and safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4972" data-end="5085"&gt;So if you can still raise your arms easily overhead, you’ve held onto something priceless: freedom of movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5092" data-end="5157"&gt;5) You can walk up a flight of stairs without getting winded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5159" data-end="5229"&gt;Forget treadmills for a second—stairs are the real-life stress test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5231" data-end="5437"&gt;If you can climb a flight (or two) without gasping for air or clutching the railing, your cardiovascular system is in great shape. It means your lungs, heart, and muscles are working efficiently together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5439" data-end="5704"&gt;When I hike the Griffith Observatory trail in Los Angeles, I sometimes spot groups of older walkers cruising up the incline while chatting like it’s nothing. They’re not “fitness freaks.” They’re just consistent movers who’ve built endurance into their lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5706" data-end="5922"&gt;Cardio health is less about how fast you go and more about how easily your body handles effort. If you can recover quickly after climbing stairs—heart rate settles, breathing evens out—you’re doing something right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5924" data-end="6078"&gt;The truth is, stamina fades only when we stop using it. If you can still walk up stairs with ease at 65, you’re outpacing a lot of people half your age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6085" data-end="6116"&gt;6) You can touch your toes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6118" data-end="6146"&gt;Simple test, deep meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6148" data-end="6441"&gt;If you can still bend forward and touch your toes without straining or pain, it means your hamstrings, hips, and lower back are staying flexible and cooperative. That’s a big deal, because flexibility isn’t just about movement—it’s about how well your body circulates blood and moves energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6443" data-end="6619"&gt;When your muscles shorten or tighten over time, your whole system starts working harder to compensate. You might notice more back stiffness, shorter strides, even poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6621" data-end="6863"&gt;During the pandemic, I started a daily stretch routine—nothing fancy, just 10 minutes in the morning—and the difference was incredible. Not just in how I moved, but in how I felt. Stretching isn’t about being bendy—it’s about feeling awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6865" data-end="7008"&gt;So if you can still fold forward and reach those toes, your body’s elasticity is alive and well. You’re keeping your connective tissue young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7015" data-end="7071"&gt;7) You can twist and look over your shoulder easily&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7073" data-end="7168"&gt;This one’s often overlooked, but it might be one of the clearest signs of a well-aging spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7170" data-end="7364"&gt;The ability to rotate your torso smoothly—without pain, stiffness, or awkward compensation—shows that your spine is still hydrated, your muscles are balanced, and your nerves are unrestricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7366" data-end="7567"&gt;Think about how often you use rotation in daily life: reversing a car, swinging your arm, reaching behind you. Most people lose that ability because they stop using it, not because they’re “too old.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7569" data-end="7743"&gt;A physical therapist once told me, “The spine rewards movement.” That line stuck with me. Movement nourishes your spinal discs by keeping them flexible and fed with oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7745" data-end="7942"&gt;If you can still twist easily to look behind you, you’re preserving one of the most vital aspects of mobility—spinal health. It’s also a quiet signal that your nervous system is aging gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7949" data-end="7997"&gt;8) You can carry your groceries in one trip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7999" data-end="8053"&gt;Okay, I’ll admit—this is one of my favorite “tests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8055" data-end="8256"&gt;If you can grab a few grocery bags and make it from your car to the kitchen without stopping, your grip, shoulders, and core are in solid shape. That’s functional strength—the kind you use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8258" data-end="8495"&gt;Grip strength, in particular, is one of the best predictors of healthy aging. Studies consistently show that people with stronger grips tend to live longer, experience fewer health complications, and maintain better cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8497" data-end="8605"&gt;It’s not just about having big muscles. It’s about how efficiently your body generates and sustains force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8607" data-end="8863"&gt;I’ve noticed this when traveling in places like Japan and Portugal—older people walking home with shopping bags or carrying water bottles uphill. They’re not training for it; it’s simply part of life. And that lifestyle naturally keeps their strength up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8865" data-end="8996"&gt;If you can still do your grocery haul in one go, you’re not just saving time—you’re showing off solid endurance and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="9003" data-end="9040"&gt;The quiet truth about aging well&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9042" data-end="9141"&gt;Here’s the thing most people get wrong about aging: it’s not a steady decline—it’s a negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9143" data-end="9273"&gt;Yes, you lose some muscle mass and flexibility with time. But how &lt;em data-start="9209" data-end="9215"&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; that happens depends on your habits, not your birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9275" data-end="9439"&gt;These eight movements aren’t about athletic performance or competition. They’re about your ability to live well—to move through your day with confidence and ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9441" data-end="9684"&gt;People who age well usually share one mindset: they stay curious about what their bodies can do. They don’t stop squatting, balancing, stretching, or walking. They make movement part of daily life instead of something to “fit in” at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9686" data-end="9767"&gt;And when they notice something getting harder, they don’t surrender—they adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9769" data-end="9852"&gt;Aging gracefully isn’t about denying time; it’s about using what you have wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="9859" data-end="9879"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9881" data-end="9971"&gt;If you can still perform these movements at 65, your body’s doing better than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9973" data-end="10076"&gt;You’ve maintained strength, flexibility, and control in a world that constantly encourages stillness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10078" data-end="10233"&gt;And if you can’t do them &lt;em data-start="10103" data-end="10108"&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;, don’t stress. The beauty of the human body is that it’s responsive. It learns, it rebuilds, it adapts—no matter your age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10235" data-end="10323"&gt;Start small. Stretch in the mornings. Take the stairs. Practice getting off the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10325" data-end="10410"&gt;Because aging well isn’t about turning back the clock—it’s about staying in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10412" data-end="10474"&gt;Your body’s still listening. Keep giving it something to do.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

Your hair keeps growing just fine, but the color fades thanks to the cells in the hair follicles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That switch doesn’t happen because your whole body suddenly “gets old.” It starts inside each follicle, where pigment stem cells are supposed to leave their safe zone, catch a cue, and become the color-making melanocytes that dye each new strand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When those cells, known as melanocyte stem cells (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193459091000651X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McSCs&lt;/a&gt;) stop moving on schedule, the color step gets skipped – even though the hair still grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study adds to our basic understanding of how melanocyte stem cells work to color hair,” said study lead investigator Qi Sun, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NYU Langone Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The newfound mechanisms raise the possibility that the same fixed positioning of melanocyte stem cells may exist in humans. If so, it presents a potential pathway for reversing or preventing the graying of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-natural-cure-male-baldness-highly-effective-sugar-2-deoxy-d-ribose/"&gt;human hair&lt;/a&gt; by helping jammed cells to move again between developing hair follicle compartments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-follicle-cells-and-gray-hair"&gt;Follicle cells and gray hair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside a follicle, two neighborhoods matter most for color. The hair germ sends out strong chemical messages that tell pigment stem cells to mature into melanocytes. The bulge is a safer hangout with no “make color now” message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a healthy cycle, stem cells travel from the bulge into the hair germ right as a new hair begins. Next, they hear the signals from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/wnt-protein" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WNT proteins&lt;/a&gt;, then shift into McSCs, and load pigment into the growing shaft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later on, some of the cells that produce gray hairs will reset to a stem-like state for the next round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers watched this in action rather than guessing from snapshots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using long-term live imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing across multiple growth cycles in mouse follicles, they tracked where individual cells were and what instructions they were reading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When regrowth was repeatedly forced, more pigment &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blood-stem-cells-grown-in-the-lab-for-first-time-ever-leukemia-treatment/"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; lingered in the bulge, missed the WNT-rich zone, matured less often, and gray hairs increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The location of the gray hair follicle cells led to a signal, the signal led to a decision, and that decision led to the hair’s color – or to gray when that chain broke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-location-movement-and-timing"&gt;Location, movement, and timing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That process completely reframes how we think about follicle cells and graying hair. Time matters, but not like a countdown clock that drains color. Movement and timing matter more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigment stem cells have to make the trip at the right moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is the loss of chameleon-like function in melanocyte stem cells that may be responsible for graying and loss of hair color,” said study senior investigator &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/mayumi-ito-suzuki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mayumi Ito, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/dermatology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/cell-biology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Department of Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt; at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lose that chameleon behavior – arriving in the right neighborhood when the cue is loud – and you can still grow healthy hair shafts that emerge silver because the dye step never happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations-on-gray-hair-cell-study"&gt;Limitations on gray hair cell study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists are careful to point out that there were limitations to what could be proven in this study. Stress isn’t a single switch that turns hair gray for good, and simply flipping stem cells “on” won’t fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gray hair follicle cells can be present and still fail if they never reach the signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any future approach would need to help them move on time or make the hair germ more inviting, not just blast the whole follicle with a random growth command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might ask how this maps to people, since the experiments used mice. Human follicles share the same architecture and cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this fact, two separate paths make sense to explore in greater detail: restore the commute so pigment stem cells reach the hair germ right when a new hair starts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, tune the local cues so that, once there, cells clearly hear the message to become McSCs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing and restraint would be critical. Push too many cells to mature at once and you could drain the reserve; push too few and nothing changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fixing-gray-hair-cells-in-the-real-world"&gt;Fixing gray hair cells in the real world&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal isn’t a permanent “color” switch – it’s to keep the rhythm going so some cells color the hair now while others reset for later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this fits a simple idea: cells read their surroundings before they act. DNA provides options; the neighborhood tells them which option to pick today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In gray hair follicles, neighborhoods shift across time and space. When pigment &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stem-cells-can-shift-from-hair-growth-to-skin-healing/"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; reach the right spot at the right moment, they catch the message, become melanocytes, and color the strand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When movement or timing fail, the message is lost and the hair grows in gray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no treatment yet – this is just a map, not a medicine. However, scientists do believe they’re getting very close to a real-world solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-for-scientists"&gt;Next steps for scientists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future studies in people confirm the same pattern, scientists can test gentle ways to ease the traffic – nudging cells out of the bulge or strengthening the hair germ’s signals – without derailing the rest of the system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to protect flexibility. They must mature enough cells to color the hair you’re growing now, and keep enough in reserve so the system still works years from now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the next time you spot a gray strand, remember that your hair didn’t forget how to grow. The factory is fine; it’s the commute inside the follicle that jammed. Fix the traffic and, in theory, color could return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, gray doesn’t have to mean weak or unhealthy hair. It can mean the pigment team missed its cue – and that turns gray from a mystery into a timing problem science is learning how to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05960-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 01:42:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQTmRaUy1qS2RHTjZjbTRQNl9yRko0TU9MOEhVNldKS1ZOekhINjZfdkswUzBLdVVlZWg2empDSi1IUF9HLXRvQXN3aERVVFZORkR2bHoya1d2NWdfajJHYXZWN05HNDFHZnlhZWs3OGxoZGtMYTVMNEo5RzRLY0JlelRqM3NwaW03UjFidjlKN3BtQmJISWFPWmFvbDAzbFBjaXVTN1ltN0Y</guid></item><item><title>专家说，治疗关节疼痛的最佳药物不是你想的那样- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/the-best-medicine-for-joint-pain-isnt-what-you-think-expert-says</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Stiff knees, aching hips and the slow grind of chronic joint pain are often accepted as an unavoidable part of getting older. But while osteoarthritis is the world's most common joint disease, experts say the way we treat and prevent it is badly out of step with the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best medicine isn't found in a pill bottle or an operating theatre – it's movement. Yet across countries and health systems, too few patients are being guided toward the one therapy proven to protect their joints and ease their pain: &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/exercise-670"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is one of the most effective treatments for chronic, disabling joint conditions &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-are-the-key-risk-factors-for-developing-knee-osteoarthritis-we-reviewed-the-evidence-253722"&gt;such as osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. Yet very few patients actually receive it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/do-your-knees-click-heres-what-it-means-and-when-to-see-a-doctor"&gt;Do Your Knees 'Click'? Here's What It Means, And When to See a Doctor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research across health systems in &lt;a href="http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11227783/"&gt;Ireland, the UK, Norway&lt;/a&gt; and the United States shows the same pattern: fewer than half of people with osteoarthritis are referred to exercise or physiotherapy by their primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 60 percent are given treatments that guidelines do not recommend, and around 40 percent are sent to a surgeon before &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/do-you-have-knee-pain-from-osteoarthritis-you-might-not-need-surgery-heres-what-to-try-instead-236779"&gt;non-surgical options&lt;/a&gt; have even been tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why those figures are so troubling, it helps to understand what exercise does for joints. Osteoarthritis is by far the most common form of arthritis, already affecting more than 595 million people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00163-7/fulltext"&gt;global study in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, that number could approach one billion by 2050. Longer life expectancy, increasingly sedentary lifestyles and rising numbers of overweight or obese people are driving the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet people who exercise regularly are physically and biologically protecting themselves from developing the disease and from suffering its worst effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cartilage that covers the ends of our bones is a tough, protective layer with no blood supply of its own. It relies on movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a sponge, cartilage is compressed when we walk or load a joint, squeezing fluid out and then drawing fresh nutrients back in. Each step allows nutrients and natural lubricants to circulate and maintain joint health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why the old idea of osteoarthritis as simple "wear and tear" is misleading. Joints are not car tires that inevitably grind down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis is better understood as a long process of wear and repair in which regular movement and exercise are critical to healing and to the health of the entire joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177108" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/WomenHoldingOntoHandLikeItsInPain-e1760056845637.jpg" alt="women holding onto her other hand like she's in pain" class="wp-image-177108 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177108" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Osteoarthritis impacts the whole joint region. (SimpleImages/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A disease of the whole joint&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now know osteoarthritis is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3295952/"&gt;whole-joint disease&lt;/a&gt;. It affects the joint fluid, the underlying bone, the ligaments, the surrounding muscles and even the nerves that support movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic exercise targets all these elements. Muscle weakness, for instance, is one of the earliest signs of osteoarthritis and can be improved with resistance training. There is strong &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889857X12001299?via%3Dihub"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that muscle weakness increases the risk of both developing the disease and seeing it progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nerve and muscle control can also be trained through &lt;a href="https://www.jospt.org/doi/full/10.2519/jospt.2025.13041"&gt;neuromuscular exercise&lt;/a&gt; programs &lt;a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-017-1439-y"&gt;such as GLA:D®&lt;/a&gt; (Good Life with osteoArthritis: Denmark) for hip and knee osteoarthritis. Usually delivered in supervised group sessions by physiotherapists, these programs focus on movement quality, balance and strength to improve joint stability and rebuild confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant improvements in pain, joint function and quality of life &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1063458421000339"&gt;have been recorded&lt;/a&gt; for up to 12 months after completing the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is good medicine for the whole body: it has documented benefits across more than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26606383/"&gt;26 chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;. In osteoarthritis, it helps not only by strengthening cartilage and muscle but also by tackling the inflammation, metabolic changes and hormonal shifts that drive the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2596954/"&gt;major risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for osteoarthritis, and not merely because of the extra mechanical load on joints. High levels of inflammatory molecules in the blood and in joint tissues can degrade cartilage and accelerate disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For osteoarthritis, regular activity can counter this at a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9110817/#S1"&gt;molecular level&lt;/a&gt;, lowering inflammatory markers, limiting cell damage and even altering gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise first, surgery later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently there are no drugs that modify the course of osteoarthritis. Joint replacement surgery can be life-changing for some people, but it is major surgery and does not succeed for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise should be tried first and continued throughout every stage of the disease. It carries far fewer side effects and brings many additional health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osteoarthritis is not simply a matter of "worn out" joints. It is shaped by muscle strength, inflammation, metabolism and lifestyle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular, targeted exercise addresses many of these factors at once – helping to protect cartilage, strengthen the whole joint and improve overall health. Before considering surgery, movement itself remains one of the most powerful treatments we have.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260638/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERRYVILLE, Mo. — A morning DJ at a classic rock station servicing parts of the St. Louis area died after contracting the &lt;a href="/article/news/local/missouri-west-nile-virus-leaves-3-dead-15-hospitalized-mosquitos/63-d5b229dc-b920-4c01-824e-acadcb39ac21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;West Nile Virus,&lt;/a&gt; according to the station he worked at.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On social media, Classic Rock 93.1 KBDZ said that Kevin "Kevy Kev" Russell died Thursday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"About five weeks ago, it seems Kevin contracted the West Nile Virus. He had a fever he couldn't get rid of, so when his temperature spiked and stayed there, he was admitted to the hospital," the station said. "His condition deteriorated and it became obvious after a while, he was not going to get better again."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell was also the general manager for the station based out of Perryville. The station said Russell was a beloved leader and was a key part of day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For this small staff, this has been one of the most brutal things we have ever been through. Kevin basically built this station in the basement of his house and is responsible for ALL of the technical aspects of the station. That's why we've had so much trouble lately," the station said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio sportscaster Paul Brown also &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/paulbrownmedia/posts/pfbid02yfSzybej2QASi3m4bzn2UMmvcTWRUmgDqsP7zXwabuCBJfgr4Z2CnJicATXVVCAGl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;gave a tribute to Russell&lt;/a&gt; on social media; Brown said he first met him in the 80s when they were early on in their broadcast careers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fast forward to this spring. Kevin had the idea to bring high school football games to the radio in St Charles on 101.7FM. He asked me to do the play by play.  So nearly 45 years after our first gig together, Kevin and me became colleagues once again," Brown said. "He worked tirelessly getting the station and me ready for the broadcasts. I was unsure of myself after so many years between broadcasting games but Kevin reassured me and made me realize it was “just like riding a bicycle.” He was right and I’m having more fun doing radio now than ever."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the Missouri Department of Public Health and Senior Services said that the West Nile virus has been spreading faster in the state than usual. It said as of Oct. 4, three people died and 15 people were hospitalized from the Mosquito-borne virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

They tracked 54 women aged 18 to 40 not using hormone-based contraception and grouped them according to how much exercise they took: inactive (reported not taking part in any form of structured exercise), recreationally active (taking part in at least two hours of structured exercise a week), competing in any sport at club level, and elite (competing in any sport at national or international level).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They then completed cognitive tests and reported their mood and symptoms on the first day of menstruation, two days after the end of menstruation (late follicular phase), the first day ovulation was detected, and between ovulation and menstruation (mid-luteal phase).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study, published in Sports Medicine – Open, found that women perform best on cognitive tests when they ovulate, with on average participants reacting about 30 milliseconds faster compared with later in their cycle and making fewer mistakes. But for elite athletes, the difference in performance was much more pronounced. On average, their attention and inhibition scores were more than 120 milliseconds faster, and their simple reaction time was 80 milliseconds faster at ovulation than the luteal phase of their cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Flaminia Ronca, the lead author of the study from UCL Surgery and Interventional Science and the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, said: “At an elite level, 80 milliseconds slower reaction times makes a big difference and in a fast-paced sport like rugby, it could put you at greater risk of concussion or serious musculoskeletal injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the other end of the exercise spectrum, the authors also found that compared with active participants (at whatever level), inactive participants had reaction times on average about 70 milliseconds slower and made about three times as many impulsive errors, regardless of cycle phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This difference could determine whether we regain balance after tripping over an obstacle or not, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This shows the importance of incorporating some form of recreational physical activity into our lives,” Ronca said. “It doesn’t have to be that intense or competitive to make a difference – and crucially, it’s something that we can control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Responding to the findings, Stephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/women" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Women&lt;/a&gt; in Sport said: “While it is fascinating to understand the tiny cognitive supercharging that happens the day of ovulation, the most interesting conclusion is around the cognitive benefits of being active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Having the time to register and respond to a risk is the difference between having a fall or righting yourself. For women in wiser life, avoiding falls is especially vital given the huge gendered health inequality around osteoporosis with one in two women over 50 suffering from this, compared to one in nine men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We already knew being active can build bone strength and now we know being active can increase our response times. This report adds a second layer of urgency to get women active and address the tragedy and cost of fragility fractures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxORVdKS09Xem83V0lES2x6X0pZNTdMWktNaEtacFpUT1FmZ21HM2NMRF9idXUtQ2ZRbUJSUkZocnRUSXpqWWZMWHNJN3pBcXhMV2t0bVd3WHdFa2tCbWY5TWFKZ3VCdzVOZUpKaEtXUlRaTGRIWUV3ZGh1bVgxOVg4UGNGMURTbWJZWFQ0SXB5SXJObmpUVVhvcmRoM2Q2Q1VhS1RqdzRn</guid></item><item><title>加州大学在3天内赢得5项诺贝尔奖—并创下新的世界纪录-加州大学</title><link>https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-wins-5-nobel-prizes-3-days-and-sets-new-world-record</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;America’s scientific leadership faces unprecedented threats &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet now the very system that has powered decades of world-changing scientific discovery, here at UC and in thousands of academic and government labs across the country, is at risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2025, the federal government has canceled or delayed thousands of research grants to hundreds of U.S. universities. While funding for many of UC’s projects has been restored, the interruptions and uncertainty have plagued research that is poised to deliver vital new knowledge, including studies of aging, addiction, obesity, maternal and fetal health and Alzheimer’s disease. And the federal government is considering further cuts to science funding in its budget for the coming year. This year, the Trump administration sent a budget request to Congress calling for deep cuts to federal science agencies — in some cases by up to half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is going to cripple science, and it is going to be disastrous if this continues,” said Clarke in an &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/video/watch/idRW147207102025RP1/?chan=science&amp;amp;location=channel-item"&gt;interview this week&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of what Congress decides about the coming year’s budget, the disruptions that government and academic labs have already experienced will reverberate for a long time. “It may take a decade to get back to where we were, say, half a year ago,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

You unconsciously relax&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;When you see green trees, smell pine and hear gentle rustling leaves or the sound of birdsong, your autonomic nervous system - a network of nerves controlling unconscious processes - responds instantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This can happen on a visit to the local park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We see changes in the body such as a lowering of blood pressure and heart rate variability so your heart beats slower," says Baroness Kathy Willis, a biodiversity professor at Oxford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-44097-3" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;A UK study&lt;/a&gt;, involving nearly 20,000 people, found that those who spent at least a total of 120 minutes every week in greenery were significantly more likely to report good health and higher psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The evidence for the benefits of spending time in nature is compelling enough that some areas have trialled so called green social prescribing connecting people with nature to improve their phsyical and mental health, with a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/social-prescribing/green-social-prescribing/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;positive impact on happiness and wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;2. Your hormones reboot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Your body's hormonal system also joins in the relaxation act. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Willis says that spending time outdoors lowers levels of cortisol and adrenaline - the hormones that surge when you're stressed or anxious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"A study found that people in a hotel room for three days who were breathing in Hinoki (Japanese cypress) oil saw a big drop in the adrenaline hormone and a big increase in natural killer cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Natural killer cells are cells that tackle viruses in the body.

          &lt;p&gt;An October meeting of a key federal vaccine advisory committee has been canceled without explanation, sparing the evidence-based childhood vaccination schedule from more erosion—at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was planning to meet on &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251003112109/cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html"&gt;October 22 and 23&lt;/a&gt;, which would have been the committee's fourth meeting this year. But the meeting schedule was updated in the past week to remove those dates and replace them with "2025 meeting, TBD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars Technica contacted the Department of Health and Human Services to ask why the meeting was canceled. HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard offered no explanation, only saying that the "official meeting dates and agenda items will be posted on the website once finalized."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACIP is tasked with publicly reviewing and evaluating the wealth of safety and efficacy data on vaccines and then offering evidence-based recommendations for their use. Once the committee's recommendations are adopted by the CDC, they set national vaccination standards for children and establish which shots federal programs and private insurance companies are required to fully cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the committee has been stacked with highly esteemed, thoroughly vetted medical experts, who diligently conducted their somewhat esoteric work on immunization policy with little fanfare. That changed when ardent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. became health secretary. In June, Kennedy abruptly and unilaterally fired all 17 ACIP members, falsely accusing them of being riddled with conflicts of interest. He then installed his own hand-selected members. With the exception of one advisor—pediatrician and veteran ACIP member Cody Meissner—the members are poorly qualified, have gone through little vetting, and embrace the same anti-vaccine and dangerous fringe ideas as Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corrupted committee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, Kennedy's advisors have met twice, producing chaotic meetings during which members revealed a clear lack of understanding of the data at hand and the process of setting vaccine recommendations, all while setting policy decisions long sought by anti-vaccine activists. The first meeting, in June, included seven members selected by Kennedy. In that meeting, the committee rescinded the recommendation for &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/rfk-jr-s-cdc-panel-ditches-some-flu-shots-based-on-anti-vaccine-junk-data/"&gt;flu vaccines containing a preservative called thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; based on false claims from anti-vaccine groups that it causes autism. The panel also ominously said it would re-evaluate the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/all-childhood-vaccines-in-question-after-first-meeting-of-rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel/"&gt;entire childhood vaccination schedule&lt;/a&gt;, putting life-saving shots at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and the Kansas Department of Agriculture (KDA) are alerting the public to the first known occurrence of the Asian longhorned tick (ALHT) in Kansas. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;KDHE said it identified the tick after it was found on a dog in Franklin County last week.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The health department said it’s an exotic, invasive tick species that was first identified in the United States in 2017. Since then, it has spread westward across the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/cattle/ticks/asian-longhorned/asian-longhorned-tick-what-you-need-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the tick has now been documented in 21 states, with Kansas being the most recent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="kvjhyvwn" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“We have been monitoring the spread of the Asian longhorned tick, especially since it was confirmed in neighboring states,” Animal Health Commissioner Dr. Justin Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now that it has been identified in Kansas, we have been in contact with accredited veterinarians across the state to remind them to be alert for this tick and to ensure they understand the risks.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This tick, which can reproduce without the need for a male tick, has both human and animal health implications. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2019, an ALHT in Virginia was found to be infected with Bourbon virus, while Connecticut recently identified an ALHT infected with ehrlichiosis, both of which are tick-borne diseases that occur in Kansas but are currently transmitted by the Lone Star tick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re still learning about this tick and the ecologic role that it currently plays and may play in the future in terms of disease transmission to humans,” said Dr. Erin Petro, KDHE state public health veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While the human health implications are uncertain, this tick has serious implications for animal health.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The tick can cause extreme infestations on affected animals, sometimes leading to severe anemia or even exsanguination. Beyond the physical threat, the ALHT also transmits the cattle parasite &lt;em&gt;Theileria orientalis &lt;/em&gt;Ikeda strain, which causes &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/bovine-theileriosis-infosheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bovine theileriosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, KDHE piloted a program to create a passive tick surveillance network of veterinary clinics throughout the state. Through this program, participating clinics submit tick samples from animals in their care to KDHE for identification. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of these partners submitted a routine sample, which was later identified as ALHT and confirmed by the USDA. In both humans and animals, tick bite prevention is key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of disease, follow these precautions:&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be aware of where ticks are found and use preventive measures when in grassy, brushy, or wooded areas.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Dress preventively by wearing long pants tucked into socks and a shirt tucked into pants.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Treat clothing and gear with permethrin.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use an EPA-approved repellent such as DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) when enjoying the outdoors or being in a tick habitat.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;After coming indoors, perform a thorough tick check, being sure to focus on the waistband, under the arms, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of knees, and in and around the hair.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Check pets for ticks, especially around the tail, between the back legs, under the front legs, between the toes, in and around the ears, around the eyes, and under the collar.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Shower soon after being in a tick habitat or engaging in outdoor activities. This will help remove any unattached ticks and identify any attached ticks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;To remove attached ticks, use a pair of fine-tipped tweezers, grasp the tick near the skin, and apply gentle traction straight outwards until the tick is removed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Help prevent tick-borne diseases and tick infestations on pets by consulting with your veterinarian on the use of a veterinary-approved flea and tick preventative.&lt;/li&gt;
