						Health officials in Provincetown, Massachusetts, issued a warning of potential exposure to hepatitis A on Saturday, after a food service worker was infected with the virus.In a statement, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), Barnstable County Department of Health and Environment and the Provincetown Board of Health warned anyone who dined at The Red Inn at 15 Commercial St. in Provincetown between April 30 and May 15, that they may have been exposed to hepatitis A and should contact their healthcare provider.According to the DPH statement, the food service worker at the restaurant who worked during those dates has a confirmed infection with the hepatitis A virus.As hepatitis A is highly contagious, the DPH urged customers who may have been exposed to the virus to contact their health care provider immediately to receive appropriate medical treatment.The DPH said preventive measures against the hepatitis A virus include the hepatitis A vaccine and hepatitis A immune globulin.However, the DPH said these are generally only effective at preventing hepatitis A infection if given within two weeks of exposure, prior to symptom onset.The DPH said early signs and symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice (dark urine, yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes). Hepatitis A typically varies in severity, with mild cases lasting two weeks or less and more severe cases lasting four to six weeks or longer.Additionally, the DPH said some people, particularly children, may not develop jaundice and may have an illness so mild that it can go unnoticed.However, the DPH said even mildly sick people can still be highly infectious, and people who become sick with hepatitis-like symptoms should consult a health care provider, even if the symptoms are mild.Hepatitis A can be spread between people through food handling, and the DPH said it can be spread by contaminated food and beverages. The DPH advises customers who dine at The Red Inn between April 30 and May 15 to practice thorough handwashing, especially before preparing food, to avoid any potential further spread of the virus.

Not every man has 75 children across Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued: “I analysed the variant using population and patient databases, computer prediction tools and the results of functional trials, and came to the conclusion that the variant was probably cancer-causing and that children born from this donor should receive genetic counselling.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who have been shown to have the gene are advised to have whole-body and brain MRI scans. They are also recommended to have breast and abdomen ultrasounds as adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Paulli Budtz, a spokesperson for the European Sperm Bank, told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;: “We are deeply affected by this case.” She said the donor had been thoroughly tested but that “it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person’s gene pool if you don’t know what you are looking for”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: “We welcome continued dialogue on setting an internationally mandated family limit, and have advocated for this on several occasions. This is also why we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 18:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOMS04Ym9BUjJMNDFTcE1NUjFsWGk3UTZBY19HOHZsWEg1eGYyek1JM1lJcnhHaUx4V3JwNTJySXBIbXNNV3hzSXdVUVcwYWR4U1FaaEdmdkFiUzEwYmtXdjk2VVFkcVFrUGE5TW5yZ2RTcW5fblBXcW10ZU1qaWJUVnRaeXcyM2NibWJORVNwdjlLRXM2eGgwd3NhdTQ</guid></item><item><title>已婚人士：口腔微生物群可能介导共同焦虑-神经科学新闻 | Married Minds: Oral Microbiota May Mediate Shared Anxiety - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE9XaThDUEtuZGVHVlQ4M2JyWG1Ba0dFRk41bnlhN3lpbVVEZjVldWFHZFlXNWM4RG0yM2dvbUtWQnFKdWVfOHJiRC0tTFVJTklRRHVDbHpKR2VZZGNrV19MLUlQME1fU0Jwd0N6bHpPeFRVUnVkd1VNVk4xQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study suggests that oral microbiota transmission between newlywed couples may influence the onset of depression and anxiety symptoms. Researchers observed that healthy spouses of partners with insomnia, depression, and anxiety developed similar mental health symptoms and microbiota profiles within six months of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found strong correlations between shared bacterial strains, altered cortisol levels, and increased depression and anxiety scores. While the findings are not yet causal, they highlight a possible microbial route for emotional contagion between intimate partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbial Convergence:&lt;/strong&gt; Spouses’ oral microbiomes became more similar over time, particularly when one partner had depression and anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mood Correlation:&lt;/strong&gt; Changes in microbiota composition correlated with increased salivary cortisol and worsening mental health in the healthy partner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Bacteria Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher levels of Clostridia, Veillonella, Bacillus, and Lachnospiraceae were linked to the depression-anxiety phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral microbiota dysbiosis and altered salivary cortisol levels have been linked to depression and anxiety. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that bacterial transmission can occur between spouses, this study aimed to investigate whether the transmission of oral microbiota between newlywed couples mediates symptoms of depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validated Persian versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory were administered to 1,740 couples who had been married for six months. The researchers compared 268 healthy control spouses with 268 affected cases in a cross-sectional study. Data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months, healthy spouses married to an insomniac with the depression-anxiety (DA) phenotype scored significantly higher on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory compared to their baseline scores. This indicates that their sleep quality, depression, and anxiety scores became more similar to those of their affected spouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the composition of their oral microbiota changed significantly, becoming increasingly similar to that of their spouses. Specifically, in couples where one partner had the DA phenotype, the oral microbiota of the healthy spouse mirrored that of the affected partner (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbial changes correlated with alterations in salivary cortisol levels as well as depression and anxiety scores. Linear discriminant analysis revealed that the relative abundances of &lt;em&gt;Clostridia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Veillonella&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/em&gt; were significantly higher in insomniacs with the DA phenotype compared to healthy controls (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transmission of oral microbiota plays a partial role in mediating depression and anxiety among couples. Since this study is associational, further research is needed to establish whether this association is causal. If it is determined that this association is indeed causal, it could have significant implications for contemporary research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose that, within the framework of diagnostic, predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine, the practical and theoretical implications of this study may enhance our understanding of various aspects of microbiota-host interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this microbiome and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#097a6c7b7f606a6c49716068616c797c6b65607a6160676e276a6664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Shelly Zhang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://xiahepublishing.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Shelly Zhang – Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.14218/ERHM.2025.00013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oral Microbiota Transmission Partially Mediates Depression and Anxiety in Newlywed Couples&lt;/a&gt;” by Neil Daghnall et al. &lt;em&gt;Exploratory Research and Hypothesis in Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p id="p21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 14:59:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9XaThDUEtuZGVHVlQ4M2JyWG1Ba0dFRk41bnlhN3lpbVVEZjVldWFHZFlXNWM4RG0yM2dvbUtWQnFKdWVfOHJiRC0tTFVJTklRRHVDbHpKR2VZZGNrV19MLUlQME1fU0Jwd0N6bHpPeFRVUnVkd1VNVk4xQQ</guid></item><item><title>这是您不想忘记清洗的身体部位： “总是捕捉污垢” -《纽约邮报》 | This is the one body part you don’t want to forget to wash: ‘Always traps grime’ - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPSllFZTJiRC1aVmRrVjl1NzM1eWxkQVFhQ3dyblg5ZlZ3SUFMSlRLQXBuWmwxQUJPQ1hISmoxYnY4d3hyRU9ybFU2YmV4LUZjZWJoRVBYVDhaSGY0U2dRampKdkM3OHIwS3g4VEZ6ZHJEUUdESXE1bThJQ2dPVmVnMy05NjlBZ3AybUp3NnQyUXlhOUZBNEo1YXFQMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;You might be rinsing and repeating — but you’re probably not as clean as you think.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dermatologists say there’s one spot most people overlook in their shower routine where dirt, oil and dead skin cells can accumulate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Left unchecked, that buildup can lead to bacterial infections, painful skin problems and a foul odor that lingers long after you’ve toweled off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Studies show roughly two-thirds of Americans shower daily.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Daria – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/how-to-clean-your-ear"&gt;generally agree&lt;/a&gt; that your ears do a good job of cleaning themselves, so you can probably toss the Q-tips. But the area around them is a different story. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I always recommend people wash the skin behind their ears intentionally and specifically to get into the creases of where the ear meets your skin, as it can always trap grime,” &lt;a href="https://www.beloithealthsystem.org/find-a-provider/roger-kapoor-m-d-m-b-a-f-a-a-d-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Roger Kapoor&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and senior vice president at Beloit Memorial Hospital, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/most-people-forget-to-wash-this-body-part" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told Parade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;That’s especially true in summer, when sweat and sunscreen create a moist breeding ground for bacteria and fungus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people who wear glasses, the arms resting behind the ears can also easily transfer bacteria to the skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ear-itation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oil, dirt, and dead skin cells piling up behind your ears can clog pores and cause painful pimples and acne.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It can also irritate your skin — and even trigger &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/what-to-know-about-ear-eczema" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ear eczema&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ear eczema symptoms range from hardly noticeable to extremely uncomfortable.

 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;artem_goncharov – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This inflammatory skin condition causes red, itchy patches that can be dry, flaky or waxy, depending on the type.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Any inflammatory condition of the skin can lead to cracks in the natural skin barrier, allowing bacteria in and causing infections,” Dr. &lt;a href="https://stcharlesdermatologicsurgery.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stacey Tull&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and micrographic dermatologic surgeon, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-wash-dirtiest-body-parts-in-shower-study-8384889"&gt;told Real Simple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even tiny cuts, piercings or scratches inside the ear can open the door to infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In rare but serious cases, those infections can spread beyond the ear and into the bloodstream — potentially leading to life-threatening sepsis, when the body starts attacking its own organs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s that smell?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infections behind the ears can also give off a foul, cheeselike stench, often thanks to bacteria, yeast and fungi, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/smell-behind-ears#causes"&gt;according to Healthline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Possible causes of a smell behind the ear include poor hygiene and infections.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Krakenimages.com – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sweat gland behind the ears also secrete perspiration starts to stink once it mixes with bacteria and oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add sebaceous glands, which secrete a waxy mix of oils and fats, and you’ve got a recipe for some serious funk if it builds up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem can be even worse for people with overactive glands that release extra sweat and oil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Wash up — and when to get help&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If an infection is painful, you have a fever, swollen lymph nodes or home treatments like over-the-counter antifungal creams don’t work, it’s probably time to see a doctor, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325081#prevention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some infections need stronger antibiotics to clear up and prevent serious complications. Doctors can also prescribe anti-inflammatory ointments to soothe eczema symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Doctors can help diagnose pain behind the ear and recommend various treatments.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;bnenin – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the area behind your ears is simple to clean. All you need is gentle soap and warm water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trickiest part is probably remembering to scrub the area after hitting all the usual spots in the shower.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kapoor says shampoo can help break down oil and bacteria behind your ears, but it rinses off quickly unless you specifically scrub the area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you wear glasses, he also recommends cleaning the arms regularly to keep bacteria from transferring to your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

However, its effects typically last only a week, and frequent dosing poses risks like dissociation or addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study demonstrates that ketamine’s benefits can be extended up to two months by using a compound that enhances ERK signaling, a pathway essential to ketamine’s long-term action. This breakthrough offers a proof of principle for safer, more sustained depression treatment strategies targeting intracellular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid-Acting Relief:&lt;/strong&gt; Ketamine alleviates depression symptoms within hours, even in resistant patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extended Efficacy:&lt;/strong&gt; A compound called BCI prolonged ketamine’s antidepressant effect up to two months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism-Based Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhancing ERK signaling may help sustain antidepressant effects from a single dose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roughly 10 percent of the U.S. population is afflicted with major depressive disorder at any given time, and up to 20 percent will exhibit MDD symptoms over their lifetimes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite its prevalence, methods to treat MDD often fall short for a not-insignificant portion of the population. Antidepressants—the standard of treatment—don’t work for 30 percent with MDD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When infused at a low dose ketamine shows remarkable efficacy as a rapidly acting antidepressant, with effects observed within hours even in patients who have been resistant to other antidepressant treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110354"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;By inhibiting the phosphatase, the authors retained ERK’s activity and augmented the synaptic plasticity that drives ketamine’s prolonged antidepressant effects. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, consistent infusions of ketamine are needed to maintain symptoms at bay, which could result in side effects, such as dissociative behaviors and the possibility of addiction, and stopping treatment can result in relapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, Lisa Monteggia’s and Ege Kavalali’s labs show that it is feasible to substantially extend the efficacy of a single dose of ketamine from its current duration of up to a week to a longer period of up to two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The premise of this study, which was led by Zhenzhong Ma, a fantastic research assistant professor, was based on a testable mechanistic model that we developed that accounts for ketamine’s rapid antidepressant action,” Monteggia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monteggia holds the Lee E. Limbird Chair in Pharmacology and is the Barlow Family Director of the Vanderbilt Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, researchers in the field had determined that ketamine’s antidepressant effect requires the activation of a key signaling pathway called ERK, but only ketamine’s long-term effects—not its rapid effects—are abolished when ERK is inhibited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fast-acting antidepressant, ketamine relies on ERK-dependent synaptic plasticity to produce its rapid behavioral effects. Ma and colleagues hypothesized that they could maintain ketamine’s effects for longer periods by enhancing ERK activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the recent paper, Ma discovered that ketamine’s antidepressant effects could be sustained for up to two months by using a drug called BCI, which inhibits a protein phosphatase and results in increased ERK activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By inhibiting the phosphatase, the authors retained ERK’s activity and augmented the synaptic plasticity that drives ketamine’s prolonged antidepressant effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the use of BCI make the application of these results to the clinic difficult, Monteggia said that the results provide a proof of principle that ketamine’s antidepressant action can be sustained by targeting intracellular signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and Kavalali, the William Stokes Professor of Experimental Therapeutics and the chair of the Department of Pharmacology, have worked on the project since its inception and hope that it fosters other studies looking to identify specific molecules that will enhance and sustain the action of a single dose of ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this work will be a steppingstone toward improving MDD patients’ lives by reducing the burden of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#afc2ceddc6dcdcce81dcc7cedfc6ddc0efd9cec1cbcaddcdc6c3db81cacbda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marissa Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vanderbilt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Marissa Shapiro – Vanderbilt University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abb6748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Enhanced ERK activity extends ketamine’s antidepressant effects by augmenting synaptic plasticity&lt;/a&gt;” by Lisa Monteggia et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced ERK activity extends ketamine’s antidepressant effects by augmenting synaptic plasticity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated ketamine treatment to maintain a rapid antidepressant effect can lead to side effects over time, highlighting an unmet clinical need for sustaining this drug’s antidepressant action from a single administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses has been proposed to be a key synaptic substrate for antidepressant action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we found that ketamine-induced CA3-CA1 synaptic potentiation could be augmented by transiently increasing extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) activity through pharmacological inhibition of dual-specificity phosphatases 6 (DUSP6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antidepressant-like behavioral effects of acute ketamine treatment were extended by DUSP6 inhibition for up to 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selective deletion of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in excitatory neurons abolished these DUSP6 inhibition–mediated synaptic and behavioral effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data suggest that ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects can be sustained by selectively targeting downstream intracellular signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s that effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Wells added that “what we’ve learned here is that there’s a lot of communities across the US that have these lower vaccination rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Summer tends to be a high season for travel, and travelers may import measles from a state or country experiencing an outbreak into at-risk communities like these, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;If we had vaccine coverage above 95%, we would not see these outbreaks.

While public health departments have frequently worked on shoestring budgets, the Trump administration has made funding even more precarious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There was a clawback of the Covid funding that was available to local health departments,” Wells said. And with other federal funds for public health, “it’s even harder to follow exactly what’s going on,” Wells noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I’m concerned. It’s so important for us to have local public health departments that can respond to things like measles or whatever the next outbreak is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE4yTEN3Nm1VQ1JWMDdpNFV2WXFHdDVDZlpGemhIQ3lvRmxyQWhrWDhCdVBpdzkyMGZGbmR5M2NKdTJNd3l3RmpKQjBkNUtqQS1vNGZzMUk4TXFsMjF2aUJMcnJUcGVxVnJsSmRTeU5YdVZwT0dxM28yOTF3</guid></item><item><title>根据胃肠病学家的说法，最简单的高纤维交换可以改善肠道健康- EatingWell | The Easiest High-Fiber Swap for Better Gut Health, According to a Gastroenterologist - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE01QWN1Y0c4XzdLeTZrV0dDb05BQU9IZHRGb3h4b3FNeE8zWTFjTG9scjVNdloyTl8teHNZUzJMT2VnSlFEYkZHdEpyNEY0LThxbWtLWERkZnVpNFFtQzBzcEJHSmg5a3h4cThGZVFKaE9oMlhQQ0JhTHZQRHlTaE0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gastroenterologist suggests swapping white bread for sprouted grain or whole wheat bread.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White bread is made with refined grains, which can cause blood sugar spikes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprouted grain and whole wheat bread are gut-healthy options that can support heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we believe that any food can be enjoyed in a healthy eating pattern. Sometimes this means having less nutritious foods in moderation rather than completely cutting them out of your diet. And it could also mean swapping some of your go-tos with similar, healthier versions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a recent Instagram video, gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fact-or-fiction-gastroenterologist-on-gut-health-myths-8726665" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Will Bulsiewicz, M.D., MSCI&lt;/a&gt;, shared an easy swap that you can make for your breakfast or lunch. If you’re a toast lover or sandwich fan, this is for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s time to rethink your bread, because there’s a high probability that your pantry has white bread, which is made from refined grains,” Bulsiewicz says. He then explains why eating refined grains isn’t the best option for your gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When they refine the grains, they’re stripping away the fiber, the vitamins, the minerals, all the good stuff,” he shares. “Throwing that in the trash, and they’re leaving you with the stuff that’s going to spike your blood sugar.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is recent science that shows a diet high in ultra-processed foods and refined carbs can increase your risk for gut and heart problems.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the flip side, research suggests that focusing on whole grains can help reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s why Bulsiewicz recommends swapping out white bread for sprouted grain or whole-wheat bread.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This type of whole grain bread means more fiber, slower digestion, better blood sugar control plus the whole grains have antioxidants and phytonutrients that are wonderful for you and have anti-inflammatory properties,” Bulsiewicz explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Brands like Food for Life and Dave’s Killer Bread sell delicious sprouted grain bread in the same aisle as your other favorite loaves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to note that if you’re a fan of white bread, it’s totally OK to have it when you’re in the mood for it. But if you’re a daily bread eater, swapping for a more nutrient-rich option is a smart choice. Choose whole-wheat or sprouted grain when making a high-protein &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8046558/best-tuna-salad-recipe/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tuna salad sandwich&lt;/a&gt;, or when you’re enjoying toast with jam or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-peanut-butter-good-for-you-8638482" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;peanut butter&lt;/a&gt;.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a Tufts interdisciplinary engineer and his team have devised a simple device using specially designed floss that can easily and accurately measure cortisol, a stress hormone, in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It started in a collaboration with several departments across Tufts, examining how stress and other cognitive states affect problem solving and learning,” said Sameer Sonkusale, professor of electrical and computer engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t want measurement to create an additional source of stress, so we thought, can we make a sensing device that becomes part of your day-to-day routine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cortisol is a stress marker found in saliva, so flossing seemed like a natural fit to take a daily sample.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their design of a saliva-sensing dental floss looks just like a common floss pick, with the string stretched across two prongs extending from a flat plastic handle, all about the size of your index finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The saliva is picked up by capillary action through a very narrow channel in the floss. The fluid is drawn into the pick handle and an attached tab, where it spreads across electrodes that detect the cortisol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol recognition on the electrodes is accomplished with a remarkable technology developed almost 30 years ago called electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polymers (eMIPs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They work similarly to the way you might make a plaster cast of your hand. A polymer is formed around a template molecule, in this case cortisol, which is later removed to leave behind binding sites. These sites have a physical and chemical shape “memory” of the target molecule so they can bind free-floating molecules that are coming in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eMIP molds are versatile, so one can create dental floss sensors that detect other molecules that can be found in saliva, such as estrogen for fertility tracking, glucose for diabetes monitoring, or markers for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also potential for detecting multiple biomarkers in saliva at the same time, for more accurate monitoring of stress, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The eMIP approach is a game changer,” said Sonkusale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Biosensors have typically been developed using antibodies or other receptors that pick up the molecule of interest. Once a marker is found, a lot of work has to go into bioengineering the receiving molecule attached to the sensor. eMIP does not rely on a lot of investment in making antibodies or receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you discover a new marker for stress or any other disease or condition, you can just create a polymer cast in a very short period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accuracy of the cortisol sensors is comparable to the best-performing sensors on the market or in development. Bringing this device into the home and in the hands of individuals without need for training will make it possible to fold stress monitoring into many aspects of health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently Sonkusale and his colleagues are creating a startup to try and bring the product to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points out that while the dental floss sensor is quantitatively highly accurate, the practice of tracking markers in saliva is best for monitoring, not for the initial diagnosis of a condition. That’s in part because saliva markers can still have variations between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For diagnostics, blood is still the gold standard, but once you are diagnosed and put on medication, if you need to track, say, a cardiovascular condition over time to see if your heart health is improving, then monitoring with the sensor can be easy and allows for timely interventions when needed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces&lt;/em&gt;, adds to a number of  thread-based sensor innovations by Sonkusale and his research team including sensors that can detect gases, metabolites in sweat, or movement when embedded in clothing and transistors that can be woven into flexible electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#234e4a48460d504a4f5546516357564557500d464756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mike Silver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tufts.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mike Silver – Tufts University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5c02988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Saliva-Sensing Dental Floss: An Innovative Tool for Assessing Stress via On-Demand Salivary Cortisol Measurement with Molecularly Imprinted Polymer and Thread Microfluidics Integration&lt;/a&gt;” by Sameer Sonkusale et al. &lt;em&gt;ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saliva-Sensing Dental Floss: An Innovative Tool for Assessing Stress via On-Demand Salivary Cortisol Measurement with Molecularly Imprinted Polymer and Thread Microfluidics Integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On-demand dental-floss-based point-of-care platform is developed for the noninvasive and real-time quantification of salivary cortisol utilizing redox-molecule embedded molecularly imprinted polymer structures and thread microfluidics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herein, we explore the high-surface-area graphene-based electrode substrate for electrochemically synthesizing selective cortisol MIPs and integrate it with thread microfluidics to build a highly sensitive cortisol-sensing platform for stress monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This platform uses flossing to collect and transport saliva to a flexible electrochemical sensor via capillary microfluidics, where cortisol, a stress biomarker, is measured. This strategy allowed us to detect cortisol as low as 0.048 pg mL&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; in real-time with a detection range of 0.10–10,000 pg mL&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.9916).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The saliva-sensing dental floss provides results within 11–12 min. The thread-based microfluidic design minimizes interference and ensures consistent repeatability when testing both artificial and actual human saliva samples, yielding 98.64–102.4% recoveries with a relative standard deviation of 5.01%, demonstrating high accuracy and precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the human saliva sample (as part of the stress study), the platform showed a high correlation (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.9910) against conventional ELISA assays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with a wireless readout, this saliva floss offers a convenient way to monitor daily stress levels. It can be extended to detect other critical salivary biomarkers with high sensitivity and selectivity in complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 12:59:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE0xYURWQ0lTMXpfVTVXNzFtRW1YaGtFanRZS2V3b2xNZUFzZ25vRDJOaVNpbVBWME13WFFlcENYakR2X3VPTGFENHpJUG5NMEg2RmVncEVWa0ZFZGFKMmV6RFA3QW5jUkZudHc</guid></item><item><title>医生揭示了您需要开始服用的关键维生素组合- AOL.com | Doctors Reveal the Crucial Vitamin Combo You Need to Start Taking - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE1wSEt5Y0VwWVNyS0x6OEp0aEVzcTdoYkFxMnpLYVpXSDB4Y21ETVFqQ0thbVBFckRHT0xuX0wwUnd4WXNnUWRORDhfUEl3ckZCbWk3bWlfbGJweWoyNzhrZGlPTVA2TXZNNGtxNEFwSDViSllaTjZTS19sMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;6 Ideal Vitamin Pairs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Tanja Ivanova - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some things just go better together — and that includes certain vitamins and minerals. Whether you want to get more from your supplements or plan a more balanced plate, &lt;strong&gt;pairing complementary vitamins and minerals&lt;/strong&gt; is a win for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certain nutrients work synergistically, meaning one helps the other absorb more efficiently in the body,” says &lt;a href="https://somerset-medical.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nicholas Church, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nicholas Church, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified family medicine physician and founder of Somerset Medical. “In my 24 years of practicing medicine, I’ve seen how simple adjustments — like combining the right nutrients — can lead to improved lab results and long-term health benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another potential perk?

Together, vitamin D, vitamin K, and vitamin A help ensure that your body functions at its best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin K2 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5613455/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helps direct calcium to bones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;helps direct calcium to bones&lt;/a&gt; rather than soft tissues when vitamin D increases calcium absorption, while vitamin A balances the immune-regulating properties of vitamin D,” says Dr. Cole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamins you shouldn't mix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to remember that not all vitamins and minerals get along. Some nutrients actually counteract each other, which means spacing them out is a smarter approach.

But ultimately, synergy is more than just pairing the right nutrients — timing, balance and individual needs matter, too. Always talk to your healthcare provider before adding potential supplements to your routine to make sure they’re safe and effective for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 12:41:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1wSEt5Y0VwWVNyS0x6OEp0aEVzcTdoYkFxMnpLYVpXSDB4Y21ETVFqQ0thbVBFckRHT0xuX0wwUnd4WXNnUWRORDhfUEl3ckZCbWk3bWlfbGJweWoyNzhrZGlPTVA2TXZNNGtxNEFwSDViSllaTjZTS19sMA</guid></item><item><title>根据新科学，步行仅需5分钟即可对您的大脑产生影响- AOL.com | Walking For Just 5 Minutes Does This To Your Brain, Per New Science - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE0tdW5MT1hZRVZ0REZrcDJxSHp1eG9KZ253X3RGQVVFY0ZNOC1jTDEzcnNpTVZyVkpuNnpmU1VkOTVlc1RRYmFIMFVkcnJvcU5SOFgzWENQMUY3dUpLS09SSUJyaFVCeGtORlowTlNKSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Walking For Just 5 Minutes Does This To Your Brain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Westend61 - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new study found five minutes of a certain type of exercise can boost your brain health, especially in older adults.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to the elevation in your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g30985585/hiit-workout-at-home/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt; with "brisk" physical activity, more blood flow goes to your brain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The key is to exercise to the point where you notice heart rate and breathing rate increase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64803574/brain-doctors-neurologists-on-protecting-brain-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Taking care of your brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Taking care of your brain&lt;/a&gt; requires a 360 approach, and includes simple things like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a42112641/7-day-meal-plan-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eating well;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;eating well&lt;/a&gt;, exercising regularly, and constantly challenging your mind by learning and trying new things. But new research also suggests that logging just five minutes of a particular exercise can help give your brain a big boost, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/54/4/afaf072/8106300?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Age and Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Age and Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that doing short bursts of exercise that raise your heart rate can help enhance cognitive performance, especially in older adults. But what kind of exercise are we talking about and why does it help? Here’s the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, is the medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University; &lt;a href="https://www.adventhealth.com/institute/adventhealth-research-institute/team/audrey-collins" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Audrey Collins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Audrey Collins&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, is the lead study author and a post-doctoral research scientist with AdventHealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed data from 585 older adults between the ages of 65 and 80 who participated in the longitudinal IGNITE trial. The researchers looked at a range of things, including the participants’ &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64853713/sleep-cognitive-performance-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep habits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep habits&lt;/a&gt;, physical activity, and sedentary behavior over 24 hours, and stacked that against their cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a macro level, the researchers found that people who did more exercise had better brain health. When they did less, it seemed to decline. But when they dug into the specifics, they found that doing just five minutes of exercise that gets your heart rate up—like a brisk walk, water aerobics, or a light jog—was linked with better cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, when people did more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity like brisk walking, they had better processing speed, (how fast your brain thinks), executive function (how well you plan, focus, and multitask) and working memory (your ability to store information for short periods of time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is brisk walking good for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big perk of brisk walking is that it can get your blood pumping, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “Brisk walking increase blood flow to your legs and gets your heart rate up,” he says. “Any time your heart rate goes up, the flow of blood to your head is increased.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise and movement in general is helpful for brain health, explains &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. “What’s good for the body is usually good for the brain,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want more walking inspo?

The researchers specifically wrote this: “Moving from ~1 minute of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day to ~6 minutes per day had the largest predicted differences in the domains of executive function/attentional control, processing speed, and working memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is considered “brisk” walking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brisk walking is basically any walk speed that gets your heart rate up. "Brisk walking involves moving at a pace where you notice an elevation in your heart rate and breathing rate, which reflects an increased intensity of physical activity," says &lt;a href="https://www.adventhealth.com/institute/adventhealth-research-institute/team/audrey-collins" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Audrey Collins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Audrey Collins&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, lead study author and a post-doctoral research scientist with AdventHealth. "For example, walking at a leisurely pace is representative of low-intensity physical activity, while brisk walking at a faster pace moves into a moderate-intensity level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, next time you’re short on time for a full workout, consider at least taking a quick walk around the block. It’ll do your brain health a solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Clifton 9&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp

    &lt;p&gt;Conductor John Mauceri is no stranger to health struggles. He was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2017, then chronic lymphocytic leukemia and interstitial lung disease in 2019. Medication treated the conditions and sent the cancer into remission, but he has remained on the lookout for recurrence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, Mauceri, then 78, contracted COVID-19. He struggled to climb the stairs and developed a "troublesome" cough. He went to the emergency room at NYU Langone, where he has previously received medical care. An X-ray found viral pneumonia and severe lung disease. Doctors removed three liters of liquid from his right lung. The only relief, he said, was that there was no trace of cancer. He left the hospital about a week later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within weeks, new symptoms quickly emerged. First, his left ankle swelled. Then the swelling continued up his leg. As the weeks passed, the swelling entered his abdomen and inched down his right leg. At one point, Mauceri was gaining a pound every day. He was also dealing with fatigue and shortness of breath. He couldn't conduct. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was wearing somebody else's body, at least from my waist down. I couldn't wear normal clothes," Mauceri said. "Putting shoes on was hard. I couldn't walk through my house." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one on his care team could identify what was causing the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I had an oncologist, I had a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist. I had a lot of doctors, and they all thought it was somebody else's domain," Mauceri said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Searching for a diagnosis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Adam Skolnick, a cardiologist at NYU Langone and one of Mauceri's doctors, said the team first looked for more common causes for the swelling. Mauceri underwent MRIs and other tests. An exam found his lymph system was working normally. Cardiac catheterization, where a thin tube is guided through the heart, found no signs of heart disease. There were no signs of blood clots, cancer recurrence or other likely conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the swelling was beginning to strain Mauceri's body, putting him at risk of multi-organ failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While studying the images of Mauceri's heart, Skolnick began to form a theory. But "the only definitive way to fully diagnose and treat Mr. Mauceri would be through surgery to open the chest," the doctor said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is pericardial constriction? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skolnick thought Mauceri might have pericardial constriction, which occurs when the sac around the heart, or the pericardium, is thickened by scarring. That prevents the heart from fully opening. It can create pressure, resulting in swelling in the legs and abdomen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a rare condition that is usually acquired because of a prior illness, Skolnick said, including viral infections like COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since there are no tests that look at the pericardium specifically, Mauceri would have to undergo open-heart surgery to confirm the diagnosis. The condition would also be treated in that same surgery. After Mauceri's care team eliminated all other possible options, they decided it was time to go into the operating room in June 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauceri was nervous about the prospect but it seemed like his only option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no alternative," he said. "I said, 'Well, let's just do it.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A high-risk surgery  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eugene Grossi, a cardiothoracic surgeon and leader of NYU Langone Heart's robotic surgery team, performed Mauceri's surgery. When he opened the conductor's chest, he found that Mauceri's "heart was trapped" inside a thick shell of scarring. Typically, the pericardium is like a paper bag. Mauceri's was like shoe leather, Grossi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't think about it, but your lungs expand with every breath you take. Your chest wall opens. Your lungs expand. The heart does also, because it has to be able to accept the blood that's coming back from your arteries and veins. And his was just trapped," Grossi explained. That entrapment leads to fluid retention, creating swelling, Grossi said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the scarring, Mauceri's heart was functioning well. With the diagnosis made, Grossi and the surgical team had to scrape the pericardium and attached scar tissue carefully off the heart. Removing the pericardium creates no lasting health issues, but the procedure, called a pericardiectomy, is a delicate one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's almost like the heart is a hard-boiled egg, and we're peeling off the shell," Grossi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mauceri's procedure went smoothly, his doctor said. Once the pericardium was removed, Mauceri's urine output bag began to fill, proving to the surgeons that the pressure was off and blood was pumping smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Every day is a miracle"   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Mauceri was released from the hospital, he quickly began losing weight. He said he feels like he's in the best shape he's been since college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is extraordinary because not only did I survive it, but I'm stronger than ever as a result of it," Mauceri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His health struggles didn't end immediately. Shortly after the heart surgery, he was hospitalized again for a blockage of the small intestine. That was quickly treated, again at NYU Langone, but it slowed his recovery. It wasn't until December 2024, more than a year after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, that Mauceri was able to conduct an orchestra again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mauceri conducted back-to-back performances in London and Paris, getting used to being onstage again. In May, he traveled to Japan to conduct in Tokyo. The 13-hour flight and long performance days felt like the first test of his endurance after his illnesses, he said. The performance was a raging success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauceri said he has no plans to slow down now that he's back to work. In between spending time with his family in New York City, he plans to travel the country for other concerts, including at the Hollywood Bowl in September, shortly after his 80th birthday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I was conducting as if I wasn't on the cusp of being 80 anymore," he said. "I was allowed to do that because my doctors gave me this added time in my life where I can do that. So every day is a miracle. Every day I'm grateful for what they did." &lt;/p&gt;

These inputs include sunset, sunlight, meals, social cues and physical activity that help mark where we are in a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are all what we call time givers, or they give time to the brain,” he said. In other words, they help the brain sense where it is in the 24-hour circadian cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for a younger person, dinner time may help the brain understand that bedtime is in a few hours; for someone older, this connection may not happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nerves that are supposed to give the brain time cues have undergone the same amount of &lt;span&gt;degeneration as the brain, Parthasarathy said. T&lt;/span&gt;his inability to sense time cues is part of the reason why older people tend to get tired before their children or grandchildren. And, as a result, wake up fully rested and earlier than the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The light our eyes take in is part of it, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Interestingly, one of [the reasons] seems to be that the vision changes that come with age reduce the intensity of the degree of light stimulation that our brain receives, which plays an important role in ‘setting’ our circadian clock and keeping it on track,” Lustig said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parthasarathy explained that this is especially true for people with cataracts, a common eye condition that impacts more than 50% of Americans ages 80 and up, &lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/cataracts" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the National Institutes of Health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b432ae4b095274facca2a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/cataracts" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;according to the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. Cataracts cause blurred vision, double vision and general trouble seeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If&lt;span&gt; there’s cataracts, the evening light doesn’t go into the eyes as much, so, according to the brain, sunset is earlier than when it actually set,” Parthasarathy said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Since there is less light getting into the eyes because of the vision issues cataracts cause, the body starts to release &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/melatonin" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="melatonin" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b432ae4b095274facca2a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/melatonin" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt; (the sleep hormone) earlier than it should. For younger people, melatonin “starts rising after sunset,” Parthasarathy said, which is why you generally feel tired a few hours after. &lt;span&gt;For people with cataracts whose brain thinks sunset was earlier, their perceived sunset is earlier, which makes them tired sooner in the evening. And going to bed sooner means waking up earlier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There is some evidence that cataract removal surgery can help improve sleep quality and duration by helping those light cues get through,” Lustig said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: LWA/Dann Tardif via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;LWA/Dann Tardif via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The amount of light your eyes take in each evening impacts when you're ready to go to sleep.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If this is you, there are a few steps you can take to sleep better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Parthasarathy, if you struggle with this issue, you should ignore the advice to put away the screens and instead expose yourself to bright light in the late evening. This can mean going for a walk outside before the sun sets, reading a book on a bright iPad, getting artificial lights for your home or watching TV on a bright screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These bright lights will tell the brain that the sun hasn’t set yet, which will hold the melatonin production, he said. To help yourself stay up a little later (and sleep a little later as a result), Parthasarathy said you should try these things 30 to 60 minutes before sunset, which will vary depending on the time of year and where you live in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

            Infection-causing fungi responsible for millions of deaths a year will&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;spread significantly to new regions as the planet heats up, new &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6545782/v1" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; predicts&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— and the world is not prepared. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000b3b6madevfu4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fungi are absolutely everywhere. A vast kingdom of organisms, from mold to mushrooms, they grow in environments such as soil, compost and water. They play an important role in ecosystems but can have a devastating impact on human health: Fungal infections kill an &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00692-8/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;estimated 2.5 million people&lt;/a&gt; a year, and a lack of data means that number could be far higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000c3b6mjhfcv2ch@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet we are still very far from understanding them, especially how these incredibly adaptable organisms will respond &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/09/climate/2024-hottest-year-record"&gt;to a warming climate&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000e3b6mxjc9n0a9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A team of scientists from Manchester University used computer simulations and forecasts to map the potential future spread of Aspergillus, a common group of fungi found all over the world that can cause aspergillosis, a life-threatening disease primarily affecting the lungs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000f3b6mpvok5bm4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They found certain Aspergillus species will expand their range as the climate crisis intensifies, pushing into new parts of North America, Europe, China and Russia. The study, published this month, is currently being peer reviewed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000g3b6mzcvtqmyt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Fungi are relatively under-researched compared to viruses and parasites, but these maps show that fungal pathogens will likely impact most areas of the world in the future,” said Norman van Rijn, one of the study’s authors and a climate change and infectious diseases researcher at the University of Manchester.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wei30002i3b6mghcwbyjf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The field has seen new attention thanks to the popular HBO television drama “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/25/world/zombie-fungus-ophiocordyceps-the-last-of-us-scn"&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/a&gt;,” which follows people trying to survive in a world where an infectious mutant fungus has turned most of the population into violent monsters. (HBO and CNN share the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wei30002j3b6mds1obbu4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s fiction, van Rijn said, but he hopes it will raise the profile of fungal infections&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that are killing millions in reality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000k3b6mlr03crll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillus fungi grow like small filaments in soils all over the world.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Like almost all fungi, they release huge numbers of tiny spores that spread through the air.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000l3b6mtpo31ztq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Humans inhale spores every day but most people won’t experience any health issues; their immune system clears them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000m3b6m8qsvu0ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a different story for those with lung conditions including asthma, cystic fibrosis and COPD, as well as people with compromised immune systems, such as cancer and organ transplant patients, and those who have had severe flu or Covid-19.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000n3b6mutejajyy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the body’s immune system fails to clear the spores, the fungus “starts to grow and basically kind of eat you from the inside out, saying it really bluntly,” van Rijn said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000o3b6m8g0c2e0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillosis has very high mortality rates at around 20% to 40%, he said. It’s also very difficult to diagnose, as doctors don’t always have it on their radar and patients often present with fevers and coughs, symptoms common to many illnesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0w3psi00263b6m31fma28r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fungal pathogens are also becoming increasingly resistant to treatment, van Rijn added. There are only four classes of antifungal medicines available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000q3b6m5oea2g0c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This all spells bad news as the climate shifts open up new areas for Aspergillus to colonize.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0v4x2j001i3b6m87ll1lwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillus flavus, a species that tends to prefer hotter, tropical climates, could increase its spread by 16% if humans continue burning large amounts of fossil fuels, the study found. It’s predicted to push into parts of northern America, northern China and Russia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0w56hf00283b6mrvayn1ax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This species can cause severe infections in humans and is resistant to many antifungal medications. It also infects a range of food crops, posing a potential threat to food security. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240060241" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; added Aspergillus flavus to its critical group of fungal pathogens in 2022 because of its public health impact and antifungal resistance risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000t3b6mihcjfnoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillus fumigatus, which prefers more temperate climates, is predicted to spread northwards toward the North Pole as global temperatures rise. Its spread could increase by 77.5% by 2100, the study found, potentially exposing 9 million people in Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000v3b6mpwmmxgiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Conversely, temperatures in some regions, including sub-Saharan Africa, could become so hot they are no longer hospitable to Aspergillus fungi. This could bring its own problems, as fungi play an important role in ecosystems, including healthy soils.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000w3b6mg33vq8ii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As well as expanding their growing range, a warming world could also be increasing fungi’s temperature tolerance, allowing them to better survive inside human bodies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000y3b6miw0w6cms@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Extreme weather events such as drought, floods and heatwaves can affect fungi, too, helping to spread spores over long distances. There have been spikes in fungal disease following natural disasters, such &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3620763/" target="_blank"&gt;as the outbreak&lt;/a&gt; after the 2011 tornado in Joplin, Missouri.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0vacg9001s3b6m7ny7em58@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new Aspergillus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;study “rightfully shines a light on the threat of fungi that dwell in our natural environment and how under-prepared we are to cope with shifts in their prevalence,” said Elaine Bignell, co-director of the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wczes002c3b6mogexsf5u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many uncertainties remain, however, and there is still a huge amount of research to be done, she told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00103b6mhskzz2pj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the deadly nature of aspergillosis, there is a real lack of data on where the pathogen is in the environment and who gets infected, said Justin Remais, a professor of environmental health sciences at UC Berkeley, who was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00113b6mkf33h6fj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He is leading a study of more than 100 million patients across the United States, which identified more than 20,000 aspergillosis cases between 2013 and 2023. The number of cases is increasing about 5% each year, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wexbn002n3b6mivne2o96@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Fungal pathogens are becoming increasingly common and resistant to treatment, and we are only beginning to understand how climate change is contributing,” he told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00143b6m9j3smscr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People are used to hearing about diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites, but much less so fungal diseases, said Bignell. “There is a desperate need to reverse this trend given the lethality,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00153b6mgxsiubj5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any of us in the future might be affected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

The disruptions have caused new HIV infections to surge in recent months and threaten to derail plans to eradicate the virus as a public health threat by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In one stark case, the cuts have cast uncertainty over the rollout of a newly developed injectable that scientists have hailed as “the closest thing to a vaccine that we have ever had in HIV response”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"us-news","tags":[{"id":"us-news/usaid","type":"Keyword","title":"USAID"},{"id":"technology/elon-musk","type":"Keyword","title":"Elon Musk"},{"id":"society/aids-and-hiv","type":"Keyword","title":"Aids and HIV"},{"id":"world/world","type":"Keyword","title":"World news"},{"id":"campaign/email/tech-scape","type":"Campaign","title":"TechScape (newsletter signup)"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/nick-robins-early","type":"Contributor","title":"Nick Robins-Early"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-tech","type":"Tracking","title":"US Tech"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/west-coast-news","type":"Tracking","title":"West Coast News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"us-news/2025/may/24/musk-doge-hiv-aids","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="musk-says-his-cuts-did-no-defunding" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Musk says his cuts did no defunding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Musk was projected 10ft tall above the stage at the Qatar Economic Forum this week as he gave a sweeping and combative video interview. The creator of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, who once boasted he had fed “USAID into the wood chipper”, found himself defending his cuts to humanitarian aid. Just days before, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/bill-gates-give-away-fortune-by-2045-200bn-worlds-poorest-2025-05-08/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; had accused the world’s richest person of “killing the world’s poorest children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In one especially fraught exchange with Bloomberg interviewer Mishal Husain, Musk rebuked a question about whether his cuts to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usaid" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt; had imperiled HIV/Aids programs and claimed he would “fix it right now” if any services had, in fact, been defunded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“First of all, the program, the Aids medication program, is continuing. So, your fundamental premise is wrong. It is continuing,” Musk said. “It is false. It’s false. It’s false.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rather than Musk’s cuts leaving HIV/Aids programs intact, however, global health officials said that Doge’s efforts have in reality hampered their work worldwide and thrown the protection of large swaths of people from disease into disarray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="doges-dismantling-of-usaid-plunges-aids-services-into-chaos" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Doge’s dismantling of USAID plunges Aids services into chaos&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prior to Doge’s cuts and the Trump administration’s freeze on foreign aid, the US was involved in a wide range of HIV/Aids treatment and prevention programs across dozens of countries. The government implemented the majority of its operations through Pepfar, a USAID-funded program that has contributed more than $110bn to preventing and treating the virus since the initiative began in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since Doge dismantled USAID in January, however, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/18/global-health-trump-usaid-cuts-hiv-aids-2030-drugs-vaccine-research-africa" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;future of Pepfar is uncertain&lt;/a&gt;, and many of its services are in jeopardy. A temporary waiver from the state department has allowed funding for some HIV/Aids programs to continue, but only those aimed at treating people who are already living with HIV, as well as pregnant or breastfeeding women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As a result, many prevention programs involving pre-exposure prophylaxis drugs, or Prep, ground to a halt without US funding. Even services that were allowed, such as testing and treatment, also stopped due to the disruption and confusion caused by Doge’s shutdown of USAID, according to the &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1159901#:~:text=Thousands%20of%20individuals%20%2D%20women%2C%20young%20girls%2C,for%20HIV%20prevention%2C%20screenings%20for%20tuberculosis%20or" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. People who showed up to receive testing or medicine often found that no one was there to give it to them, according to a UN health official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There were thousands of healthcare workers and community health workers, laboratorians and data clerks, for example, that immediately stopped work,” said Dr Angeli Achrekar, deputy executive director of the programme branch at the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and a former Pepfar official. “It’s not like you just turn on the light switch and all of a sudden these services start up again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The effects of the cuts have been almost immediate, according to Achrekar, and could roll back years of advancements in combating HIV infections. In Botswana, the number of people receiving Prep has decreased by half since last year. The 30,000 people in Mozambique who were receiving Prep at the end of last year recently went down to 19,000, according to a UN tally. In Zimbabwe, the number of people receiving Prep declined from 4,000 to 1,800 in the same time frame. In Nigeria, 850,000 condoms distributed in December went down to 300,000 by February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s country after country,” Achrekar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-miracle-drug-cast-into-uncertainty" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;A miracle drug cast into uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The cuts to prevention programs have also caused confusion and uncertainty around the rollout of a highly anticipated new drug called Lenacapivir. The drug, which is under review at the US Food and Drug Administration, protects patients against HIV infection through a single shot given every six months. Two &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2024" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;separate large trials&lt;/a&gt; across different populations have shown that it almost entirely blocks the risk of contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-16" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-16" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;after newsletter promotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s nearly 100% effective at stopping new infections,” Achrekar said. “It is the closest thing to a vaccine that we have ever had in the HIV response.” Other researchers have called it a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/26/lenacapavir-drug-trial-linda-gail-bekker-treating-hiv-aids-africa-women-pregnancy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pepfar announced at the end of last year that it was partnering with The Global Fund, an international organization that finances global health programs, in an effort to roll out Lenacapivir to at least 2 million people within the next three years. Doge’s cuts have thrown a potential wrench in those plans, however, since the drug would fall under the category of preventative services that the tate department’s waiver says should no longer be funded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the Qatar Economic Forum this week, Musk insisted that medication programs were continuing, and, when confronted with the example of Lenacapivir, suggested he would restore its funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Which ones aren’t being funded? I’ll fix it right now,” Musk claimed, later adding: “If in fact this is true, which I doubt it is, then we’ll fix it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In response to Musk’s comments, UNAIDS &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2025/may/20250521_PR_Musk_HIV_services" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying it was encouraged that he would review the crisis caused by halts to US funding. Musk has made similar pledges about restoring health programs that Doge cut in the past, however: in February, Musk said that efforts to prevent the spread of Ebola had been accidentally canceled but were then restored – a claim that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/elon-musk-ebola-prevention-usaid-doge/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;USAID officials said was false&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the Global Fund waits to see what the Trump administration decides to do with Pepfar, it is hoping to carry on with its plans for Lenacapivir whether the US is involved or not. Losing Pepfar’s partnership would mean a huge decrease in funding, however, as well as Pepfar’s extensive connections to organizations that could help in administering the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re not backing off the ambition to deliver Lenacapivir to two million people if we can,” said Peter Sands, the executive director of the Global Fund. “The extent to which we can continue to do that in partnership with Pepfar is uncertain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since the waiver was issued on 1 February there has been no clarity or new policy released on what the Trump administration plans to do with Pepfar. US partners working on prevention services have had their agreements terminated, while UNAIDS projects that if Pepfar’s treatment and prevention services are stopped entirely, it would result in an additional 6.6m HIV infections by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE10bkhxME1tTzMyWF82b0RNblRPSWMyVjR4SnlLV3RPME01NW1ZZnRvblgyeTd5S1M1LXZPZDF1amxHZnZyRXhmd19WNm5CdG9pbnRYcmhoQ2xGdHNKOFRWOVdVZjhZZ3BLbFo3X2ZWdDIwVVB4</guid></item><item><title>消防员分享了他在4期癌症诊断前注意到的“良性”症状，他说他感到“震惊，难以置信，愤怒” - AOL.com | Firefighter Shares 'Benign' Symptom He Noticed Before Stage 4 Cancer Diagnosis, Says He Felt 'Shock, Disbelief, Anger' - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOaWlLTmIxcmFQU0N4Tm1rUEZUZXVCVmVWMTk1emtmMS1zOWd4TlhOVVRaZjZyQ0QxRmdRTW40SFh6QS13eWRnejBYSDlmNWVfcXNTTjVzZkpNcjZSSm9fVHpMZ0lrX0tyYWc0cGg2bE9XR0dPT1pkUE41dmI0Nk9iOU93?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A firefighter in Baltimore has shared the apparently innocuous symptoms he experienced before being diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer on Valentine's Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Dorsey, 56, told the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; that his swallowing issues were “very benign," but that his health issues "progressively just started getting worse, where it was very difficult to eat anything, basically, without regurgitating it back up"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You go through all those different stages of shock, disbelief, anger," he previously told WMAR 2 News of his reaction to the diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A firefighter in Baltimore is speaking out about the "benign" symptom he noticed before he was diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Dorsey — who has worked for the Baltimore City Fire Department (BCFD) for 21 years, following in his father and grandfather's footsteps — learned of his diagnosis on Valentine's Day of this year, local ABC-affiliated station &lt;a href="https://www.wmar2news.com/local/firefighter-asks-for-community-support-in-fighting-stage-four-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:WMAR 2 News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;WMAR 2 News&lt;/a&gt; previously confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While speaking to the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/22/health/firefighter-battling-stage-4-cancer-had-very-benign-symptom/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New York Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 56-year-old, who is currently on medical leave while undergoing chemotherapy, revealed some of the symptoms he noticed before the diagnosis, which also confirmed the disease had spread to his lymph nodes and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firefighter, who is part of BCFD's Engine 57 team in Curtis Bay, said everything had been fine health-wise until he started to have some trouble swallowing in January, per &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told the outlet his issues were “very benign” at first, and sometimes he'd have to have a drink to help wash food down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BCFD Engine 57/Facebook&lt;/p&gt; Baltimore City Fire Department Engine 57&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It progressively just started getting worse, where it was very difficult to eat anything, basically, without regurgitating it back up,” Dorsey said, per the publication. Subsequent tests revealed masses in his lower esophagus, lymph nodes and liver, &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlet reported that Dorsey underwent routine check-ups every six months, and high blood pressure was his only concern before his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356084" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, "Esophageal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the esophagus.

"We’re hopeful that they’ve shrunk down, and if the chemotherapy and immunotherapies are successful in that, then we’ll just keep moving forward with that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told the publication that his medical leave will eventually turn into medical retirement. “I didn’t expect it to happen this early or happen this way,” he said, but insisted, “It’s been a great ride.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dorsey's comments come after he told WMAR 2 News about his reaction to the diagnosis in March. "You go through all those different stages of shock, disbelief, anger, and then you kind of accept it a little bit, but then you get angry again, so," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Firefighter Cancer Support Network &lt;a href="https://www.firefightercancersupport.org/resources/faq" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, "Firefighters have a 62 percent higher risk of getting esophageal cancer, and they have a 39 percent increased risk of dying from esophageal cancer," citing National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are tests that can be done that are pre-cancer tests.

And the numbers so far is not very alarming. The most common factors  such as waning immunity, decreased vaccination rates, increased international travel, and the emergence of new variants contribute to these fluctuations. However, most infections so far remain mild, presenting symptoms such as fever, sore throat, fatigue.There is no immediate cause for alarm but better to be vigilant especially with vulnerable populations such as elderly people, immunocompromised hosts and those having chronic conditions like chronic kidney diseases, Diabetes Mellitus, COPD etc.," Dr. Divya advises. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 04:49:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgJBVV95cUxQRlpIdGJvMVg0bV9URXk1OGx2YlVaU2Y1dFo5Q0ZueHNiNllGMHRyb0JvcTlkR3ZSTU5UWV9FNlVjRGJleGl1ZzA5MGJSQk0yQnZfTlpueDhRUWVUZnpQTjFrUWJhYXdkSjYyNUMyLWotb1dIZGFGY0g5SWdQaFlSZnI1R24xMDREYzlla1BCMU5YU2pna3BId0NlcWZVckhIZGNtallRUW5sbDNOeXZwR29vRVpFY2xQN2lHSnVWRVltTXE4U2lNQTJ0V0w5ZEd0NGp2OWgzNml2S0ZqUDNBYUo0ZzdiMlB5OC1RZXlrUzl3b0FBUlNKWmYxTHpBMDRfQnZuMHlYTjV3dnFSOXVQS2V3</guid></item><item><title>​近期病例激增背后的新型冠状病毒NB.1.8.1 ：与之相关的症状-印度时报 | ​New COVID variant NB.1.8.1 behind surge in cases recently: Symptoms associated with it​ - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The symptoms of NB.1.8.1 are largely consistent with those of previous Omicron variants.

Other reported symptoms include headaches, nausea, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NB.1.8.1 has demonstrated a higher transmissibility rate compared to some earlier variants. Preliminary data suggest that this variant has an enhanced ability to bind to human cells, potentially leading to increased infection rates.

They took standardised mental health tests, provided saliva samples to measure stress hormones, and had their mouth bacteria analysed using advanced DNA sequencing techniques.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the start of the six months, the healthy spouses scored normally on depression, anxiety, and sleep quality tests. However, after living with a partner with mental health issues, their scores were significantly higher. Their mouth bacteria resembled that of their depressed and anxious partners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bacterial families like Clostridia, Veillonella, Bacillus, and Lachnospiraceae became more abundant in both partners. The bacteria are linked to brain disorders, including depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Scientists believe that they affect the brain by compromising the blood-brain barrier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Women affected more &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, researchers found that women were more susceptible to this bacterial transmission; female spouses experienced more pronounced changes in both their oral microbiome and mental health scores.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also measured cortisol levels during the study and found that the stress hormone in healthy spouses married to depressed and anxious partners showed a significant increase over six months, indicating their stress response systems were being activated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer among men behind skin cancer, with about 1 in 8 men diagnosed during their lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every man’s risk is different, depending on their lifestyle, race/ethnicity, family history, and age.&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2024/02/10/prostate-cancer-diagnoses-rising-exponentially-american-men-symptoms-prevention/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prostate cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; is more likely to develop in older men, the ACS says.

That’s because of a phytochemical called sulforaphane found in these veggies, which is known to help prevent numerous types of cancer in addition to prostate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silva adds that tomatoes and watermelon have one compound that has been found to be particularly protective against prostate cancer: lycopene. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332220306521" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that lycopene can not only slow the progression and growth of prostate cancer cells, but it also could provoke the death of prostate cancer cells. However, Brockton cautions that research is still limited on lycopene, and a strong link has not been established yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silva recommends eating at least five servings of whole fruits and vegetables daily to reap their cancer-protective effects—but the more you can eat, the better, she says. She advises keeping frozen fruits and vegetables—which are just as nutritious as fresh—stocked in your freezer to add into smoothies, oatmeal, or dinners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill up on fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s another nutrient that fruits and vegetables have in common that has protective qualities against cancer: &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2023/05/27/fiber-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber can help prevent cancer in numerous ways, experts say. Eating high-fiber foods—like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, and seeds—can boost your gut health, which in turn strengthens your immune system, according to Brockton. A stronger immune system will give your body the tools to fight off potentially cancerous cells, he told &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3503404/#abstract1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; also found that eating high-fiber whole grains was able to lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer via the production of the sex-hormone binding globulin, which helps regulate androgen levels that influence prostate cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend that men consume about 28 to 34 grams of fiber per day, but Silva advises shooting for 35 grams. She recommends making easy swaps like brown rice for white rice or whole grain bread for white bread to boost your fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Small changes like that can certainly help to move the needle,” Silva tells &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also reach for high-fiber foods like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats, barley, quinoa, amaranth, bulgur, and millet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans and lentils&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens like kale, spinach, bok choy, and arugula&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples and pears&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet potatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popcorn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add in omega-3s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some research also indicates that foods rich in &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2022/10/05/omega-3s-brain-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; could also help slow the progression of prostate cancer.

More serious times, we might call an &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/things-everyone-should-know-emergency-situations/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;ambulance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what one guy did for his co-worker recently.

in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://rosalindarandall.com/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Rosalinda Randall&lt;/a&gt; trains people on how to act in a professional setting. The author, etiquette expert, and professional development coach is skilled when it comes to handling tricky work situations with tact. Bored Panda reached out to her to find out what she thinks of this whole drama. We cut straight to the chase and asked whether the guy’s actions were justified. Or, should he rather have minded his own business?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When a coworker involves you in something, it becomes your business,” replied Randall, bluntly. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;They may not want you to really become involved. All they really want is for everyone to go along with their drama.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The expert adds that because this “condition” seemed to affect the woman’s ability to stand, someone should have addressed it sooner. Someone like management, she says. “Perhaps deep inside, her colleagues were slightly skeptical about the spells, but were too timid to speak up. Or to come across as insensitive,” Randall pondered. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In this case, after so many of these precarious episodes, anyone would begin to wonder about her health,” she said. But she cautioned the colleagues about how they handled the situation. “You all took a chance to appease her fainting spells,” noted the expert. “Do any of you have medical training?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Randall says it’s human nature to be concerned. “However, in this case, the ‘911’ seemed to have a tinge of concern. It was made to catch her at her game,” she commented.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The expert told Bored Panda that she’s curious about why the guy made the call in the men’s restroom. “Why not in front of her?” she asked. “Making the call in front of her could have exposed her, calling off the ambulance, and saving her salary.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Randall adds that although there seems to be an ulterior motive in making the call, like exposing her fake episodes, there are a couple of steps he could have taken first. These include r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;eporting it to management. “This releases you and your coworkers from any liability or potential blame,” she explains. The guy could have also a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;sking his coworker for contact information for her next of kin to inform them. In case it happens again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Under the circumstances, I believe that it was the right thing to do considering the frequency of the episodes and the obvious manipulation,” Randall told us. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;People do and say bizarre things for so many reasons.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="2-102" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/calling-ambulance-coworker-faking-illness/?image_id=2-102.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Man Has Enough Of Coworker’s “Health Problems”, Calls Her An Ambulance And Watches Her Panic" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/calling-ambulance-coworker-faking-illness/?media_id=2-102" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2-102.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8742591" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2-102.jpg" alt="Doctor and woman wearing masks in office setting, discussing a severe case of attention seeking during consultation." title="Doctor and woman wearing masks in office setting, discussing a severe case of attention seeking during consultation." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-professional-aged-male-physician-inquires-about-a-female-patients-symptoms-and-takes-on-the-medical-notes-D4XTjqObck4" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Getty Images / Unsplash (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What “underlying condition” could the colleague possibly have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Randall tells us there are a number of reasons the woman could have been having these “fainting” spells. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;She may truly feel light-headed or languid from lack of sleep, too much partying, dieting, or an undiagnosed medical condition,” she said. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;She could be avoiding doing her job. She could be trying to gain the affection of a particular colleague. She could be a manipulative &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/worst-main-character-syndrome-stories/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;narcissist&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It could be a set-up for the company’s wrongdoing, looking for a pay-off.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I&lt;span&gt;f her episode was only emotional, and all she needed was someone to listen to her, fine.,” she added. “However, when it becomes a physical matter, it’s time to call an expert.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Randall believes that barring any real medical or mental condition, “someone like her will shape up only when everyone stops being her personal Good Samaritan.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As long as there are kind-hearted people, says the expert, she will continue to find them until one day, she is either fired or burns all her bridges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Interacting with entitled coworkers can be tricky because there’s no avoiding them,” Randall told Bored Panda. “You want to demonstrate that you are able to get along with your colleagues. Do they behave this way with everyone or just you? Something to think about.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you find yourself dealing with a somewhat entitled colleague, Randall suggests you learn to confidently and professionally call them out on their “slick talk.” She advises that you o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;verlook what and how they say. “Take only the necessary information and move on,” adds the expert. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stand your ground by respectfully stating your boundaries.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="3-54" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/calling-ambulance-coworker-faking-illness/?image_id=3-54.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Man Has Enough Of Coworker’s “Health Problems”, Calls Her An Ambulance And Watches Her Panic" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/calling-ambulance-coworker-faking-illness/?media_id=3-54" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3-54.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8742605" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3-54.jpg" alt="Young woman lying on office floor appearing unconscious in a severe case of attention seeking situation." title="Young woman lying on office floor appearing unconscious in a severe case of attention seeking situation." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/closeup-young-asian-woman-sleeping-floor_992756.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=0&amp;amp;uuid=d686ef45-f1b5-4374-a28c-7651bbba40c1&amp;amp;query=asian+woman+fainting" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;katemangostar / Freepik (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Recreating the Victorian era when women had fainting spells isn’t the best strategy for your professional career”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randall’s advice often comes with a dash of humor. And this time was no different. We had to stifle a giggle when the expert said, “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-memes-millennials-nostalgia/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;Nostalgia&lt;/a&gt; is nice, however, recreating the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/random-victorian-era-images/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;Victorian era&lt;/a&gt; when women had fainting spells isn’t the best strategy for your professional career.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked what she’d say to the female colleague given the chance… And this was her response:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If your spells are due to a tight corset, loosen it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If your spells are due to emotional distress, seek counseling.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If your spells are due to work overload, speak up.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If your spells are an attempt to make &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/relationships/friends/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; or flirt, stop it. You are only encouraging pity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The moment will come when your colleagues begin to question your requests—sending them off to quench your tummy’s desires. And, not paying them back!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you like feeling powerful, why don’t you take charge of your life and &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/work-money/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;career&lt;/a&gt;?” she added. “Master the art of self-sufficiency and truthfulness. The feeling will supersede the game you play on your colleagues.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Randall warned that manipulation is temporary. “People catch on eventually, she said. “And when that happens, you will stand alone, or with others who may be manipulating you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To the guy who called the ambulance, Randall had this to say: “Continue to be cordial and be thankful that you are no longer within her reach.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;People raced to the comments but many were divided…&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="1-121" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/calling-ambulance-coworker-faking-illness/?image_id=1-121.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Man Has Enough Of Coworker’s “Health Problems”, Calls Her An Ambulance And Watches Her Panic" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/calling-ambulance-coworker-faking-illness/?media_id=1-121" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1-121.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8703670" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1-121.jpg" alt="Reddit user discusses ambulance arriving at office to handle a severe case of attention seeking and possible faking symptoms." title="Reddit user discusses ambulance arriving at office to handle a severe case of attention seeking and possible faking symptoms." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="postPoll-8700483" class="post-poll poll-wrapper single-post" data-poll-viewed="false" data-post-id="8700483" data-main-post-id="" data-poll-id="12468"&gt; &lt;input class="post-8700483-poll-value" type="hidden" value="eyJwb2xsSWQiOjEyNDY4LCJwb3N0SWQiOjg3MDA0ODMsImhpZGVDb21tZW50cyI6ZmFsc2UsInF1ZXN0aW9ucyI6W3siaWQiOjEyNDY4LCJwb2xsSWQiOjEyNDY4LCJ0ZXh0IjoiSG93IGRvIHlvdSBmZWVsIGFib3V0IHRoZSBjb3dvcmtlclx1MjAxOXMgYmVoYXZpb3Igb2YgZmFraW5nIGlsbG5lc3MgdG8gZ2FpbiBhdHRlbnRpb24gYW5kIGNhcmU/Iiwib3JkZXIiOm51bGwsImFuc3dlcnMiOlt7ImlkIjo0NzY5OSwicXVlc3Rpb25JZCI6MTI0NjgsInRleHQiOiJJdFx1MjAxOXMgbWFuaXB1bGF0aXZlIGFuZCB1bmZhaXIgdG8gb3RoZXJzIiwidm90ZXMiOjQwNH0seyJpZCI6NDc3MDAsInF1ZXN0aW9uSWQiOjEyNDY4LCJ0ZXh0IjoiQ291bGQgYmUgYSBjcnkgZm9yIGhlbHAsIG5vdCBqdXN0IGF0dGVudGlvbiBzZWVraW5nIiwidm90ZXMiOjQ3fSx7ImlkIjo0NzcwMSwicXVlc3Rpb25JZCI6MTI0NjgsInRleHQiOiJNaWxkbHkgYW5ub3lpbmcgYnV0IHVuZGVyc3RhbmRhYmxlIiwidm90ZXMiOjExfSx7ImlkIjo0NzcwMiwicXVlc3Rpb25JZCI6MTI0NjgsInRleHQiOiJJIHRoaW5rIGNvd29ya2VycyBzaG91bGRuXHUyMDE5dCBlbmFibGUgaXQgYXQgYWxsIiwidm90ZXMiOjcwfV19XSwicG9zdFRpdGxlIjpudWxsLCJwb3N0VXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6XC9cL3d3dy5ib3JlZHBhbmRhLmNvbVwvY2FsbGluZy1hbWJ1bGFuY2UtY293b3JrZXItZmFraW5nLWlsbG5lc3NcLyJ9"&gt; &lt;div data-bind="if: isInitialised()"&gt;    &lt;div data-bind="if: !isLoading() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isShowingResults"&gt; &lt;div class="poll-content"&gt; &lt;h3 class="answered-content-title"&gt;Thanks!

data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Parents should always keep alcohol out of their children’s reach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gain some insight into this situation, we got in touch with &lt;span&gt;Andrew Misell, Director for Wales at &lt;a href="https://alcoholchange.org.uk/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link"&gt;Alcohol Change UK&lt;/a&gt;. He was kind enough to have a chat with &lt;strong&gt;Bored Panda&lt;/strong&gt; and discuss some of the biggest risks of minors having access to &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/before-after-quit-drinking/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One reason we have a legal purchase age of 18 for alcohol in the UK is that young people’s bodies are still growing and developing, and alcohol can cause long-lasting damage to a body that is not fully-grown,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alcohol will also have more effect on someone the smaller they are. So, children can become intoxicated much more easily than adults, and are at much higher risk of alcohol poisoning, which is sometimes fatal,” the expert explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The UK’s Chief Medical Officers say that an alcohol-free childhood is best,” Andrew continued. “That means no alcohol until at least 15 years of age; only very small amounts between the ages of 15 and 18, and never more than once a week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is it ever safe to keep alcohol under the same roof as children?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many, many adults keep alcohol at home. Obviously, if you have children, it’s sensible to keep alcoholic drinks out of their reach,” Andrew noted. “That said, one of the most common ways young people get alcohol isn’t stealing it from their parents, but being given it by them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This often happens because parents believe they can safely introduce their children to &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/before-after-sobriety-photos/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, because they want to include young people in family celebrations, or because they believe their youngsters will drink outside the home if not allowed to drink at home,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;“Building self-confidence and a sense of self-worth in children is the best way to help them avoid alcohol problems”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="6-34" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/roommate-son-broke-in-room-stole-alcohol/?image_id=6-34.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Mom Thinks Her Kids Are Angels, Denies That Her Son Is An Alcohol Thief Until He Comes Home Drunk" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/roommate-son-broke-in-room-stole-alcohol/?media_id=6-34" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6-34.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8728225" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6-34.jpg" alt="Teen sitting outside with head in hands, reflecting on being blamed for tempting after sneaking into roommate’s room to steal alcohol" title="Teen sitting outside with head in hands, reflecting on being blamed for tempting after sneaking into roommate’s room to steal alcohol" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-sitting-on-a-bench-with-their-hands-on-their-face-2frm-_U6S1s" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt; maxim bober / Unsplash (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, however, Andrew says there is no evidence that this approach works. “In fact, the younger someone starts drinking alcohol – in any setting – the more likely they are to develop an alcohol problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also asked the expert how &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/parenting/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;parents&lt;/a&gt; should approach the topic of alcohol with their kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather than introducing children to alcohol by letting them try it, parents need to be talking with them honestly – when they think they’re old enough to understand – about what alcohol is, what it does, and why it’s not suitable for them,” he shared. “That conversation might feel awkward for us as parents, in that it may oblige us to think about how much we’re drinking and why.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the expert noted, “The truth is that helping young people have a healthy relationship with alcohol doesn’t always have much to do with alcohol itself. Building self-confidence and a sense of self-worth in children is the best way to help them avoid alcohol problems and a range of mental health issues later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That self-confidence and self-worth comes from young people having good relationships with the adults around them,” Andrew explained. “So, often the best thing parents can do is spend time with their children, answer their questions, listen to their concerns, and let them know that they’ll always have someone to turn to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Readers assured the author that they had done nothing wrong, and they joined in on the conversation to share more details&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span

(CREDIT: CC BY-SA 4.0)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of people around the world suffer from chronic low back pain, often finding relief only through temporary solutions like painkillers or invasive surgeries. However, groundbreaking research from &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:McGill University;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt; offers new hope. Scientists have identified two promising drugs that tackle the underlying cause—senescent cells, also called "zombie cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Are Senescent Cells?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senescent cells accumulate naturally with age or due to stress-induced damage, such as DNA injury, oxidative stress, or mitochondrial dysfunction. These cells refuse to die and instead release harmful substances known collectively as the &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/study-reveals-why-cells-more-180700939.html" data-ylk="slk:senescence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;senescence&lt;/a&gt;-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SASP factors include inflammatory proteins, enzymes, and reactive molecules, which damage healthy tissue and accelerate degenerative diseases, including heart disease, cancer, osteoarthritis, and notably, low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Representative images of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and CD11b immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of sparc−/− mice (delineated in a dashed line). (CREDIT: Science Advances)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings are exciting because it suggests we might be able to treat back pain in a completely new way," explained Lisbet Haglund, senior author of the study and professor at McGill’s Department of Surgery. "By removing the cells driving the problem, not just masking the pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Targeting the Root of Pain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their approach, the researchers conducted experiments using mice genetically engineered to develop symptoms similar to human &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/gel-derived-from-cow-mucus-could-revolutionize-spinal-cord-treatment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spinal degeneration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;spinal degeneration&lt;/a&gt;. These mice lack a gene called SPARC, causing early spinal deterioration, inflammation, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers administered two drugs to these mice: o-vanillin, a natural compound extracted from turmeric, and RG-7112, an FDA-approved drug previously used in cancer treatments. Both drugs individually reduced pain, inflammation, and degeneration in spinal discs, but their combined use showed even more powerful results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised that an oral treatment could reach the spinal discs, which are hard to access and present a major hurdle in treating back pain," Haglund remarked. This discovery highlights an exciting new possibility for effectively managing low back pain at its source, rather than simply addressing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Do These Drugs Work?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugs belong to a category known as &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/revolutionary-new-drug-could-extend-human-life-span-by-30/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:senolytics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;senolytics&lt;/a&gt;, which specifically target and eliminate senescent cells. RG-7112 works by inhibiting proteins involved in cell survival, making it easier for the body to clear away these harmful cells. On the other hand, o-vanillin, initially included almost by accident due to its known anti-inflammatory properties, surprisingly proved capable of removing senescent cells as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also observed improved quality in vertebral bones and significantly reduced expression of pain markers within the spinal cord. This comprehensive improvement underscores the drugs’ potential as transformative therapies for chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Treatment with senolytics resulted in increased IVD volume and improved bone quality. (CREDIT: Science Advances)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why This Research Matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low back pain remains the leading cause of disability worldwide, resulting in substantial personal suffering and economic burden, exceeding $100 billion annually in the United States alone. Treatments addressing root causes rather than symptoms could dramatically shift how chronic pain conditions are managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is particularly promising because senescent cells not only worsen degeneration by releasing harmful substances but also trigger &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/researchers-develop-urine-test-early-160700895.html" data-ylk="slk:senescence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;senescence&lt;/a&gt; in neighboring healthy cells, creating a damaging cascade. Eliminating these cells early could interrupt this destructive cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies demonstrated that genetic deletion of specific markers related to senescence, like the protein p16Ink4a, reduced cell accumulation and spinal degeneration. This evidence reinforces the strategy of using senolytics like RG-7112 and o-vanillin to prevent or even reverse damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Senolytics removed SnCs and improved IVD health. (CREDIT: Science Advances)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Future Prospects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these findings are promising, further studies are necessary to confirm these drugs’ effectiveness and safety in humans. Haglund and her team aim to modify o-vanillin chemically, making it more stable and effective over longer periods in the body. The potential applications extend beyond back pain, possibly benefiting patients suffering from arthritis, osteoporosis, and other age-related diseases driven by senescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big question now is whether these drugs can have the same effect in humans," Haglund said. If successful, this research could pave the way for a new class of treatments that improve quality of life by directly targeting cellular aging and degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Comprehensive Study Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr1719" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Science Advances;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt; and authored by Matthew Mannarino, Hosni Cherif, Lisbet Haglund, and colleagues, provides detailed scientific evidence supporting the use of senolytic drugs for treating chronic back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;IVDs (L3-S1) from sparc−/− mice treated with senolytics or vehicle were isolated, and the release of 15 SASP factors was evaluated. (CREDIT: Science Advances)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the preclinical trial, mice showed reduced pain behaviors, improved spinal health, and diminished inflammatory markers after eight weeks of treatment. This suggests a promising new path forward for millions dealing with debilitating chronic pain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This advancement reflects a shift toward targeted, biology-based treatments that promise more effective and lasting relief than current symptomatic approaches. With continued research, therapies using RG-7112 and o-vanillin could transform the lives of people suffering from chronic low back pain and other painful degenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: The article above provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like these kind of feel good stories?

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline is often seen as an unavoidable part of getting older. But new research suggests that it may not be as permanent as we once believed. A team of scientists from Brazil has identified a molecule in the brain that appears to reverse brain aging and could even cancel out the effects of Alzheimer’s disease in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecule is called hevin, and it is secreted by a type of brain cell known as an astrocyte. These star-shaped cells help maintain the connections between neurons. As we age, these connections tend to weaken, which contributes to memory loss and slower thinking. Hevin plays a key role in keeping these connections strong.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.14493"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that older mice, along with mice that showed signs of Alzheimer’s, had reduced levels of hevin in their brains. When scientists increased hevin production in these animals, their cognitive abilities improved. The mice performed better on memory tasks, and their brain activity indicated healthier synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="is-wp-image-block wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all" alt="brain MRI" class="is-wp-image-block wp-image-6000995" srcset="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?quality=82 2400w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;amp;quality=82 150w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;amp;quality=82 300w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;amp;quality=82 768w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;amp;quality=82 1024w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;amp;quality=82 1536w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;amp;quality=82 2048w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=63%2C42&amp;amp;quality=82 63w" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="is-wp-image-block wp-element-caption"&gt;The X-ray of the human brain close-up image Image source: merydolla / Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, boosting hevin did not affect the buildup of beta-amyloid plaques. These plaques are commonly linked to Alzheimer’s, but their role in causing the disease is still debated. This new research suggests that there may be other ways to &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/new-study-suggests-alzheimers-may-be-reversible/"&gt;target cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; without focusing solely on removing plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech.

Much of the focus in neuroscience has traditionally been on neurons alone. By highlighting the role of these helper cells, the research opens up new directions for understanding how to reverse brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the findings are still early and based on animal studies, they offer hope for future treatments. Scientists believe that medications mimicking the effects of hevin could eventually help people &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/cognitive-decline-de-age-the-brain-stanford-study/"&gt;maintain or regain cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the study adds to our growing understanding of how the brain changes with age and &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/disabling-internet-on-your-smartphone-may-actually-reverse-brain-aging/"&gt;how those changes might be slowed or even reversed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
