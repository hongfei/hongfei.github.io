			&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, most heart attacks have been blamed on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/plastic-found-inside-more-than-50-of-plaques-from-clogged-arteries"&gt;clogged arteries&lt;/a&gt; causing &lt;a href="https://cardiology.com.sg/atherothrombosis/"&gt;atherothrombosis&lt;/a&gt; – where blood clots block flow to the heart. But new research suggests we may be underestimating the role of other causes, particularly in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the Mayo Clinic in the US analyzed 1,474 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-own-mouth-bacteria-could-give-you-a-heart-attack-new-study-suggests"&gt;heart attack cases&lt;/a&gt; in people aged 65 or younger, recorded between 2003 and 2018 in Olmsted County, Minnesota. By carefully reviewing medical records and imaging, they identified a primary cause behind each case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atherothrombosis accounted for 75 percent of heart attacks in men, which wasn't surprising. In women, it was the cause of 47 percent – less than half. That has major implications for the prevention and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-drug-better-than-aspirin-for-repeat-heart-attacks-study-finds"&gt;treatment of heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/viral-heart-attack-hack-on-social-media-could-put-lives-at-risk-experts-say"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viral Heart Attack 'Hack' on Social Media Could Put Lives at Risk, Experts Say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This research shines a spotlight on heart attack causes that have historically been under-recognized, particularly in women," &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-reveals-hidden-causes-of-heart-attacks-in-younger-adults-especially-women/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist Claire Raphael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the root cause of a heart attack is misunderstood, it can lead to treatments that are less effective – or even harmful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175234" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175234" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DiagnosisChart.jpg" alt="Heart attack causes" class="wp-image-175234 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DiagnosisChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DiagnosisChart-600x251.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175234" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;There were significant differences in heart attack causes between men and women. (Raphael et al., &lt;em&gt;J. Am. Coll. Cardiol.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the other factors significantly contributing to heart attacks were &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_coronary_artery_dissection"&gt;spontaneous coronary artery dissections&lt;/a&gt; (SCADs), where tears in artery walls collect blood, embolisms (blood clots traveling from other areas of the body), and other stressors acting on the body (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"&gt;such as anemia&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found that many SCAD-related heart attacks were initially misattributed to atherothrombosis, especially in women, where SCAD was the cause nearly six times as frequently. If heart attack causes are misdiagnosed, then doctors might take the wrong approach to trying to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-vitamin-may-help-prevent-heart-attacks-new-evidence"&gt;prevent the next one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research highlights the larger need to rethink how we approach heart attacks in this patient population, and for younger adult women, in particular," &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-reveals-hidden-causes-of-heart-attacks-in-younger-adults-especially-women/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist Rajiv Gulati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinicians must sharpen their awareness of conditions like SCAD, embolism and stress-related triggers, and patients should advocate for answers when something doesn't feel right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study didn't explore the significant difference here between men and women, but it could be the result of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-minute-quiz-could-reveal-whether-youre-at-risk-of-a-heart-attack"&gt;heart attack risk factors&lt;/a&gt; affecting women differently, or women being less likely to seek medical help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's something that future research can look into, as well as using the same analysis techniques across larger and more diverse groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, someone experiences a heart attack &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html"&gt;every 40 seconds&lt;/a&gt;, and work continues to try and understand as much as we can about the risk factors – which include &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/big-city-lights-could-be-damaging-your-heart-health"&gt;city living&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-gram-of-salt-is-the-difference-for-millions-of-heart-attacks"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tiny-particles-in-the-air-may-trigger-sudden-heart-attacks-study-suggests"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, as the team notes, we're getting better at spotting, diagnosing, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.120.047065"&gt;preventing heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; from recurring. Significant progress has been made in heart imaging technology, for example, over the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers now want to see more done to raise awareness of the alternative causes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/doctor-realizes-hes-having-a-heart-attack-while-treating-heart-attack-patient"&gt;behind heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;, both with health professionals and the public – which could ultimately save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding why a heart attack happened is just as important as treating it," &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-reveals-hidden-causes-of-heart-attacks-in-younger-adults-especially-women/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Raphael. "It can mean the difference between recovery and recurrence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.07.012"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Three children have died of measles this week as a monthslong outbreak continues to spread across Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the victims of the disease this week were younger than two, and all three died in Jerusalem, according to hospital officials and the Health Ministry. The first death was announced on Monday, another died on Wednesday night, and the third died Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, five children, all younger than two and a half years old, have died of measles since August. They are the first fatalities from measles in Israel since a previous outbreak hit the country in 2018-2019. The fatalities in that bout of measles were the first Israel had seen since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The current outbreak, which began in May, is active throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles cases have appeared in the central cities of Jerusalem, Beit Shemesh and Bnei Brak, the northern cities of Harish and Nof HaGalil, the southern cities of Ashdod and Kiryat Gat, and the West Bank settlement of Modi’in Illit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Three Jerusalem children die of measles this week as outbreak continues"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday, 21 measles patients are hospitalized, most of them children 6 or under who have not been vaccinated against measles. Of these, six children are in intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A notice warning of measles is seen on a door in the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim in Jerusalem, July 31, 2025. (Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late August, the Health Ministry &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/770-measles-cases-detected-in-israel-in-past-three-months-says-health-ministry/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that 770 people in Israel had been diagnosed with measles over the past three months. Multiple people with measles, or who had been exposed to the disease, are reported to have come to Israel on flights from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious, life-threatening viral disease. When symptoms appear, it is important to inform medical teams to allow treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;Measles is preventable through an effective and safe vaccine. Doctors have &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/infectious-disease-doctor-calls-on-community-leaders-to-encourage-measles-vaccines/"&gt;urged&lt;/a&gt; ramped-up vaccination drives in response to the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

First it receives information from &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb07070.x" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;the brain areas&lt;/a&gt; that process vision, smell, taste and hearing. If the amygdala detects a threat, such as an approaching burglar, snake or bear, it then sends messages to the hypothalamus, a region just above the back of the neck. The hypothalamus then &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-hpa-axis" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;communicates&lt;/a&gt; with the pituitary gland, which in turns gets the adrenal glands to release cortisol and adrenaline into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"This will cause your heart rate to go up, blood pressure to rise, and all the classic sort of fight-or-flight symptoms of a typical fear response will be evoked," says Feinstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, when it comes to internal threats, such as detecting raised levels of CO2 in the blood, the brain manages things in a different way. The body interprets the high CO2 as a sign of impending suffocation, as there aren't any oxygen sensors in the bloodstream. Feinstein's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051122000473" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that it is the brainstem, a region that regulates unconscious bodily functions such as breathing, that senses the rise in CO2 and initiates a sense of panic. The amygdala puts the brakes on this response, preventing fear; hence why patients like SM, who are missing their amygdala, have such an exaggerated response. (Scientists still don't know why, however, the amygdala behaves this way.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 09:01:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNdDNwenZiSUUyOC1EMm9Eb3B0RWthVUdNSGpKMHdJYXdWQjJoekZ2N2hDLThNdm9ra3dmaEJFcWc2SklLY2loZWgyd2gtZWJpM2NmTlppT2xTSkVfZjVFaXI3YWswNUF0WHB2RE9oc2YwaFJ4TnNZdnBuUk5EZ0t0RnMxZGd3V1NrX2dLVFdjMlA</guid></item><item><title>疫苗混乱？明尼苏达州的5个问题，已回答- MPR新闻</title><link>https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/09/25/answers-to-questions-about-covid19-vaccines</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Auth_supplementalText__LpEPr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By submitting, you consent that you are at least 18 years of age and to receive information about MPR's or APMG entities' programs and offerings.

They said the finding could one day lead to drug treatments designed to target the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London examined genetic data from the tumours of 644 patients and found that levels of the SPP1 protein were raised in the advanced stages of pancreatic cancer, compared with earlier stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with higher levels of SPP1 had worse outcomes, according to the research, which has been published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, funded by the ICR and Breast Cancer Now, also used lab-grown mini tumours designed to model the way cancer behaves in the human body. They found that when they “switched off” the gene to make the SPP1 protein, fewer and smaller tumours developed than when the protein was present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that this protein played a key role in mice with PDAC. They found that “switching off” SPP1 significantly extended survival among mice – none of the mice with the gene survived past 50 days, whereas 20 per cent of the mice without the gene survived to 400 days, the ICR said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found that the mice with the SPP1 gene switched off had tumours that did not spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 kIHKfN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/14/16/9bc36b1928bbb8bc24d119c5e1099357Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIzNzI2MDgz-2.76852342.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/14/16/9bc36b1928bbb8bc24d119c5e1099357Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIzNzI2MDgz-2.76852342.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/14/16/9bc36b1928bbb8bc24d119c5e1099357Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIzNzI2MDgz-2.76852342.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The team, funded by the ICR and Breast Cancer Now, used lab-grown mini tumours designed to model the way cancer behaves in the human body" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18008"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The team, funded by the ICR and Breast Cancer Now, used lab-grown mini tumours designed to model the way cancer behaves in the human body&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (PA Wire)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking SPP1 also appeared to raise the levels of another protein called GREM1, which has previously been linked to reducing pancreatic cancer spread when it is found in higher concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Axel Behrens, a professor of stem cell biology at the ICR, said: “Our research has identified a protein that, when blocked, can prevent cancer from spreading around the body and can hopefully keep patients living well for longer. The next step for this research will be to develop a drug that can precisely target the protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Kristian Helin, chief executive of the ICR, added: “Pancreatic cancer remains a devastating diagnosis for patients, as its most common form spreads aggressively and is difficult to treat. This exciting research offers hope, identifying a clear target to halt the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s an important step toward more effective treatments, and I look forward to future drug-discovery efforts building on these findings to provide new options to patients in urgent need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna Jewell, director of research at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said: “Over half of people diagnosed with this devastating disease die within just three months, an appalling survival rate that has barely changed since the 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We desperately need new, more effective treatments, and this study sheds new light on a key protein that helps pancreatic cancer spread around the body so rapidly. These promising findings could pave the way for the development of new drugs to target this protein and halt the cancer’s progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pancreatic cancer is very aggressive. Once discovered it’s often so advanced that seven in 10 people receive no active treatment – not even chemotherapy.

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the United Kingdom say they have successfully trialed what could become the world's first gene therapy for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease"&gt;Huntington's disease&lt;/a&gt; – a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that is typically inherited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results of the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="175445" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; are not yet formally published or peer reviewed, principal investigator and neuroscientist Ed Wild from University College London &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/gene-therapy-appears-slow-huntingtons-disease-progression"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the gene therapy, called AMT-130, "changes everything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest dose can apparently slow disease progression by as much as 75 percent over three years. It also led to a significant reduction in a biomarker of neurodegeneration, found in cerebrospinal fluid, which usually increases with disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-breakthrough-experimental-drug-suppresses-huntington-s-protein-first-time-ionis-httrx-gene"&gt;Huge Breakthrough as Experimental Drug Is First-Ever to Suppress Huntington's Protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the basis of these results, it seems likely AMT-130 will be the first licensed treatment to slow Huntington's disease, which is truly world-changing stuff," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/gene-therapy-appears-slow-huntingtons-disease-progression"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wild, who works at UCL's Huntington's Disease Center, the largest Huntington's clinical group in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huntington's is caused by a single defect in the gene &lt;em&gt;HTT&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(93)90585-E"&gt;discovered in 1993&lt;/a&gt;, which gradually destroys the body's ability to function. It does so by making a toxic version of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingtin"&gt;huntingtin protein&lt;/a&gt;, which attacks neurons in parts of the brain involved in voluntary movement, thinking, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When visible symptoms take hold, typically in mid-adulthood, patients generally have just &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/huntingtons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356117"&gt;10 to 30 years to live&lt;/a&gt;. A parent with Huntington's has a 50 percent chance of passing the disease on to their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For roughly a decade, researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.uniqure.com/pioneers-leaders"&gt;uniQure&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/emmm.201202291"&gt;world's first approved gene therapy&lt;/a&gt;, have been investigating if a similar method could work as a treatment for Huntington's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175477" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175477" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AMT130.jpg" alt="Gene Therapy Huntington's" class="size-full wp-image-175477" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AMT130.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AMT130-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175477" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;uniQure's explanation from 2019 for how it administers AMT-130. (&lt;a href="https://factor-h.org/2020-9-26-updates-on-clinical-studies-targeting-htt-and-other-topics"&gt;uniQure&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's novel drug was tested by neurologists in the United Kingdom, as it involves major brain surgery. The idea is that when high-dose AMT-130 is injected into the brain, neurons take up the custom-made DNA permanently. The genetic information contains instructions that stop cells from making the mutant huntingtin protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers expect the single dose to last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Trial results come through in numbers and graphs, but behind each data point is an incredible patient who volunteered to undergo major neurosurgery to be treated with the first gene therapy we've ever tested in Huntington's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/gene-therapy-appears-slow-huntingtons-disease-progression"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is an extraordinary act of bravery for the benefit of humanity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the phase 1/2 clinical trial, 29 patients volunteered to be treated with AMT-130, with 17 receiving a high dose and 12 receiving a low dose. Researchers then followed up with a dozen patients from each group over the course of three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-dose group showed 75 percent less disease progression than participants who did not receive any AMT-130.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not quite the "&lt;a href="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii"&gt;potentially curative results&lt;/a&gt;" the company was hoping to deliver, but it could still be a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gene-therapy-can-restore-hearing-in-adults-first-of-its-kind-trial-shows"&gt;life-changing breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; and the first real treatment for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175481" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175481" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HD_brains.jpg" alt="HD brains" class="size-full wp-image-175481" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HD_brains.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HD_brains-600x236.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175481" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The brain of someone with Huntington's Disease (right) next to a health control (left). (&lt;a href="https://sites.uab.edu/mgraylab/huntingtons-disease/"&gt;University of Alabama at Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My patients in the trial are stable over time in a way I'm not used to seeing in Huntington's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/gene-therapy-appears-slow-huntingtons-disease-progression"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wild, "and one of them is my only medically retired Huntington's disease patient who has been able to go back to work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speed at which AMT-130 has come to &lt;span&gt;clinical trials&lt;/span&gt; is impressive. In the span of &lt;a href="https://www.biospace.com/uniqure-announces-preclinical-proof-of-concept-for-gene-therapy-approach-in-huntington-s-disease-709323?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;roughly a decade&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at uniQure have taken promising preclinical data and replicated the results in animals and then humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is now conducting further &lt;span&gt;clinical trials&lt;/span&gt; in the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief medical officer, Walid Abi-Saab, &lt;a href="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; uniQure is "eager to discuss the data with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)… later this year, with the goal of submitting a Biologics License Application in the first quarter of 2026."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US FDA has already granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation and a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation, both of which could speed up its approval process. After that, uniQure also plans to apply for approval in the UK and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The trial results will be presented at the &lt;a href="https://huntingtonstudygroup.org/annual-meeting/2025-hd-clinical-research-congress/"&gt;HD Clinical Research Congress&lt;/a&gt; in October.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="384118f2-43fc-4a67-89a0-93821e7c9cde"&gt;No matter your relationship with exercise, it’s probably been drilled into you that you should warm up before playing sport or doing a workout. But does that apply to walking workouts too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s good to warm up before any type of exercise to promote proper movement mechanics and assist in preventing minor injuries that may occur when starting a workout cold,” says Solomon Lewis, a NASM-certified personal trainer and fitness specialist for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.endeavorhealth.org/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.endeavorhealth.org/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Endeavor Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="384118f2-43fc-4a67-89a0-93821e7c9cde-2"&gt;Even though walking is relatively low intensity, making a warm-up less important than if you were lifting heavy weights or running a marathon, Lewis pointed out that warming up before any workout can also serve to get you into the right mindset, and it’s a good idea if you’ve not moved for several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help prepare you for a walking workout, Lewis recommended three warm-up exercises and shared a 30-minute walking workout once you’re ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Starting with 30 minutes a day and steadily increasing the length or intensity of your walk is a great way to lose weight, strengthen your bones and improve your cardiovascular fitness,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cautions that if you are deconditioned, starting with a 30-minute workout out of the gate might be too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking for 30 minutes straight can be challenging. It may be simpler to incorporate small bouts of walking into your daily routine by parking in the farthest parking spot, walking to the farthest restroom and taking the stairs instead of the elevator,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bWvvJhJGfNGyCUz5jqR2jC" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bWvvJhJGfNGyCUz5jqR2jC slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/walking/walking-plan-weight-loss" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/walking/walking-plan-weight-loss"&gt;walking plan for weight loss&lt;/a&gt; may also help, because it can be adjusted to your current step count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-warm-up-exercises-for-walking-workouts" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-warm-up-exercises-for-walking-workouts"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Warm-up exercises for walking workouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a id="elk-f348be17-9037-481c-a0e1-8a35962f0daf" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="1-bodyweight-squat-3"&gt;1.

These groundbreaking data are the most convincing evidence in the field to date, and underscore the disease-modifying effect in Huntington’s disease, where an urgent need persists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For patients, AMT-130 has the potential to preserve daily function, keep them in work longer, and meaningfully slow disease progression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 04:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOMW1zUlhEc0JXYU5pcGNoNHZ2NzN3V3AwTTZESmNtLVJ3VmQ1dl9lNlpBSFNjTlhhNHUtUkxKOE9IN1NST3lhRUE1dWNNY3VSaWQ5bThtOFBGcHNJS1FBVGd0dXNiRDdIYjdzd1VSXzlpdi0ybFpSWnRaYXEzZzMxS0tWbXFEYUVyOUQtMGZHOHRrRmhxcFRsSGloMkZCNUJxZk5BcXNFYzQzZEtFaTJadi1n</guid></item><item><title>“这个日常习惯可以挽救你的生命！” ： 100岁的医生分享了令人惊讶的秘密，更长久，更健康-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/this-one-daily-habit-can-save-your-life-100-year-old-doctor-shares-surprising-secret-to-longer-healthier-living/articleshow/124087520.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. John Scharffenberg, a 100-year-old preventive medicine doctor and nutrition expert from California, reveals a simple yet powerful secret to longevity: daily exercise. He emphasizes that consistent physical activity can help individuals live longer, even those who are obese or face other health challenges. While traditional advice often highlights weight control, cholesterol management, and maintaining healthy blood pressure, Dr. Scharffenberg explains that these alone do not guarantee a long life. Instead, he stresses that daily movement plays a more critical role in extending lifespan, improving circulation, enhancing mental clarity, boosting immune function, and preserving muscle strength with age. His insights offer a fresh perspective on longevity, showing that small, consistent lifestyle habits—like exercising every day—can profoundly impact overall health, resilience against disease, and the quality of life not just physically, but emotionally and cognitively well into old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How daily exercise becomes the ultimate secret to longer, healthier life; doctor reveals&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an Instagram post by LongevityXlab on August 25, Dr. Scharffenberg emphasized the importance of daily physical activity. He said, “We need to exercise every day. That’s very important. I have outlived my two brothers, 13 and 17 years respectively. And each year I survive adds to that number.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective highlights that longevity is not merely about genetics or body weight, but about consistent, daily habits that strengthen the body and improve resilience against disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Scharffenberg explained a striking example from his own experience: he once spoke to a woman assisting him with PowerPoint presentations. Though she was obese, he encouraged her to focus on daily movement. He shared,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You should understand that being overweight increases the risk of dying from almost every disease we know. But here’s the good news: even if you are obese, exercising every day will help you live longer than a person of normal weight who does not exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statement underscores a critical point for longevity and preventive health: daily exercise can mitigate risks associated with obesity, hypertension, smoking, and high cholesterol, potentially extending life expectancy significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How exercise protects against disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Scharffenberg’s guidance aligns with extensive research showing that regular physical activity strengthens cardiovascular health, improves metabolism, reduces inflammation, and boosts mental resilience. Even small daily routines, such as walking, stretching, or light resistance exercises, can have a profound impact over time, especially when paired with balanced nutrition, adequate hydration, and quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasizes that the benefits are cumulative. Individuals who consistently move their bodies every day tend to experience lower rates of chronic illness and enhanced overall vitality, regardless of other risk factors or genetic predispositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical tips for incorporating daily exercise&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those looking to follow Dr. Scharffenberg’s advice, simple strategies can help make exercise a consistent habit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Begin with manageable activities like brisk walking, cycling, or yoga.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Schedule at least 20–30 minutes of movement daily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on variety to engage different muscle groups and maintain interest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pair exercise with proper nutrition and adequate sleep for maximum longevity benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By integrating exercise into your daily routine, even individuals with obesity or other health challenges can improve lifespan and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/barack-obama-meets-102-year-old-woman-her-simple-food-secrets-go-viral-inspiring-millions-with-longevity-lessons-and-life-tips/articleshow/124084018.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Barack Obama meets 102-year-old woman: HER simple food secrets go viral, inspiring millions with longevity lessons and life tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 04:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgJBVV95cUxQckFqLU5Wcm9DNDJ4TWh1bmNCc2huZUFsWVdzdFhHdjJGcVVzMUEzRTFlN05PNXVveHBfZFVhS25IRWxCMENQeURVZF9CNEpEcm1wQ29saHJBWGFHMU5YeWRXRmNYaFRCWExxN2o2c0hOay1Hb3pnU1NvVWplRC14SDUzd2F4X2dMUHUwck9vMndlMkhzYl9ITEttWkdXRE40dVFnbXRERklGLTBKSGl4M1h3TVh5WWFrX1pLaFlva1lDcURBNS01bm9SYlpzUjFxVWlzTFpBeUp3OF9LcEJaYnE2Z3RuN2lybk9CVWl6TmFqZHg2VTRjd0Y2NG1KeWlXS2NkMk9STVBIYWwtWEpldlVLQkh3OXJTeTM5c3NMSnA5VzBva19HN0xKRmNrOU04aFdiRGx3</guid></item><item><title>每天喝半茶匙这种油和温水可以改善记忆力-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/having-half-teaspoon-of-this-oil-daily-with-warm-water-can-improve-memory/articleshow/124044482.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that a common kitchen ingredient, probably resting on your kitchen shelf, can reduce the risk of memory loss?

Opting extra virgin olive oil can provide maximum benefits as it has the highest levels of antioxidants and polyphenols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a warm glass of water and add half teaspoon (around 2.5 ml) of olive oil. Stir well and consume in the morning on an empty stomach or before meals if convenient. Remember, not occasional but only regular consumption has proven benefits of memory improvement. Avoid the use of very hot water, as it can damage polyphenols in the olive oil. This simple habit may also aid digestion, reduce inflammation, support heart health, and contribute to healthy aging when practiced consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

						&lt;p&gt;Person County leaders confirmed the county’s eighth
confirmed rabies case this year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Person County Animal Services and the Person County Health Department
are urging the public to take precautions after the latest incident involved a
racoon on Ridge Road in the Roxboro city limits.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The county could not confirm any human or domestic animal
contact with the raccoon.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a deadly virus that affects the brain and nervous
system.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Immediate medical attention is critical for humans. Rabies
is 100% preventable if treated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Delaying care can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;People are urged to remain vigilant and to protect their families
and pets.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;County leaders provided the following reminders:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Do not touch or approach wild animals or unfamiliar pets.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Monitor your surroundings when outdoors.  &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Keep children and pets supervised and away from
wildlife.  &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Ensure all pets are up to date on rabies vaccinations.
This is required by law and critical for their protection.  Rabies
vaccinations are given daily at the shelter during regular business hours, no
appointment necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/person-county-eighth-rabies-case-2025-roxboro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/person-county-eighth-rabies-case-2025-roxboro/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Avoid handling stray or injured animals, even seemingly
friendly animals.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• If you or someone you know is bitten or scratched by an
animal, or if a pet encounters a wild animal:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;o In urgent situations, call 911.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;o Seek emergency medical care immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;o Call Animal Control at 336-597-1741 or the Health
Department at 336-597-2204.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Signs of a rabid animal:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Aggressive or unusually friendly behavior&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Difficulty walking, staggering&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Foaming at the mouth&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Excessive drooling&lt;/p&gt;

The women all received their first screening invitation between 1991 and 2020 and were monitored for up to 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After taking into account social, economic, reproductive, and health-related factors, the researchers found almost one in three (32%) women did not attend their first mammogram appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Not attending a first screening was linked with a significantly higher risk of breast cancer death – 9.9 deaths per 1,000 women over 25 years – compared with seven in those screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These women were also less likely to attend subsequent screenings and were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage breast cancer than those who were screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In contrast, the 25-year breast cancer rate was similar between groups. This suggests that the higher death risk among those not attending a first appointment reflects delayed detection rather than increased incidence of the disease, the team said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers wrote: “First screening non-participants had a 40% higher breast cancer mortality risk than participants, persisting over 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If early screening behaviour is predictive of later stage diagnosis and mortality risk, it could provide a valuable opportunity to identify populations at high risk decades before adverse outcomes occur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Responding to the study &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj.r1893" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in a linked editorial&lt;/a&gt;, US researchers said the results showed attending a first appointment was about “far more than a short-term health check”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For most women, the first screening appointment is unlikely to result in a cancer diagnosis or signal any areas of concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But even just turning up and getting information about how to reduce their risk and what symptoms to look out for can act as “a long-term investment in breast health and survival”, the US researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Breast screening programme eligibility varies around the world. In England, women are invited for breast screening from the age of 50 up to the age of 71. All women should have received a first invitation for a mammogram by the age of 53.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The latest NHS data shows 70% of eligible women were up to date with breast screening as of March 2024, meaning almost one in three were not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Claire Rowney, the chief executive of the Breast &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Now charity, said “a worryingly high number of women” missed their first appointment. Urgent action was needed to ensure women were encouraged to get screened, and that it was easily accessible to all invited, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Separate research showed the annual global cancer death toll was forecast to rise by nearly 75% to 18.6m by 2050. New cases are expected to rise 61% in the next 25 years to 30.5m, according to the study &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01635-6/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A global team of researchers said the trend was mostly a result of population growth and an increasingly ageing population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But they also said 42% of cancer deaths were linked to risks that could be modified, including smoking, unhealthy diets, high blood sugar and exposure to toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In more hopeful news, it emerged on Wednesday that scientists have uncovered a target for drug treatments that could stop pancreatic cancer in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers looked into the most aggressive and most common form of this cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found in a series of experiments that blocking a protein, known as SPP1, could stop the spread of the cancer and increase survival time.

			&lt;p&gt;Specific combinations of microbes living in our mouths have been associated with one of the &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-pancreatic-cancer-is-the-most-lethal/"&gt;deadliest cancers&lt;/a&gt; in humans, suggesting good oral hygiene could do more than just save our teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is clearer than ever that brushing and flossing your teeth may not only help prevent periodontal disease but may also protect against  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="175029" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/oral-microbes-linked-increased-risk-pancreatic-cancer"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; cancer epidemiologist Richard Hayes from New York University (NYU).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"&gt;pancreas&lt;/a&gt; is an abdominal organ responsible for producing enzymes and hormones our bodies use to break down and absorb nutrients in our food. Though it rarely develops tumors, those who do develop the disease face a tragically low chance of surviving in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-signal-of-a-silent-killer-cancer-may-hide-in-your-poop"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Early Warning Signal of a 'Silent Killer' Cancer May Hide in Your Poop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes, NYU epidemiologist Yixuan Meng, and colleagues used health records and oral wash samples collected through two studies involving more than 300,000 individuals aged in their fifties to seventies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considered collectively, 27 microbes identified in the mouth washes were linked to more than triple the risk of pancreatic cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/about/key-statistics.html"&gt;a disease that strikes&lt;/a&gt; 1 in 56 men and about 1 in 60 women in the US at some point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's findings, together with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MPA.0000000000002143"&gt;past research&lt;/a&gt;, suggest some of our mouth's microbes may be accessing the pancreas by travelling into the digestive system through our saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified three species of mouth bacteria in particular (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis"&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eubacterium_nodatum"&gt;Eubacterium nodatum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvimonas_micra"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parvimonas micra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and a common skin and gut fungus, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_tropicalis"&gt;Candida tropicalis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, that were linked with the increased chance of a pancreatic cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes cautions that while this doesn't necessarily mean the microbes they identified cause cancer directly, the patterns they observed highlight species that warrant further investigation. What's more, other &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; and bacterial species were associated with a decreased risk of cancer, suggesting the precise make-up of oral microflora is critical for our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers puzzled out the microbe patterns using data from two long-term health studies in America: the &lt;a href="https://prevention.cancer.gov/research-areas/networks-consortia-programs/plco"&gt;Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.10197"&gt;American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 445 of the participants in these studies developed pancreatic cancer. Their data was compared to 445 healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A bacteriome-wide scan revealed eight oral bacteria associated with decreased and 13 oral bacteria associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer," the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.3377"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer survival rate is just &lt;a href="https://pancan.org/facing-pancreatic-cancer/about-pancreatic-cancer/survival-rate/"&gt;13 percent at five years&lt;/a&gt;, often due to late diagnosis. Symptoms don't usually reveal themselves until the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-signal-of-a-silent-killer-cancer-may-hide-in-your-poop"&gt;disease is at an advanced stage&lt;/a&gt;, so understanding early risk factors, like mouth microbiome composition, could aid earlier detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By profiling bacterial and fungal populations in the mouth, oncologists may be able to flag those most in need of pancreatic cancer screening," &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/oral-microbes-linked-increased-risk-pancreatic-cancer"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; NYU epidemiologist Jiyoung Ahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team aims to examine how  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="175029" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; also contribute to these risks next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.3377"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

That simple idea sits behind a growing fitness trend: walking backward, sometimes called “retro walking.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not about showing off at the track. It’s about sharpening how you think while you move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have reported that when people walk backward, activity in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/prefrontal-cortex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; rises. That area handles decision-making, problem-solving, logic, and working memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study, participants didn’t even have to get up. They sat still and only visualized walking backward – yet they improved their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-brain-fastball-test-spots-alzheimers-disease-signs-in-just-minutes/"&gt;memory test&lt;/a&gt; scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-retro-walking-and-the-brain"&gt;Retro walking and the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline is a major concern in the geriatric population, with physical exercise being a well-established intervention for cognitive preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study from &lt;a href="https://www.dsu.edu.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dayananda Sagar University&lt;/a&gt; focused on older adults and cognition. The team recruited 36 participants aged 65 to 75. They trained three times a week for six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each supervised session lasted 30 minutes and used four-minute retro walking sets with five-minute rest intervals. The group walked backward on a flat surface at a steady pace to prevent falls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intensity increased gradually as confidence and skill improved. Participants were also encouraged to continue training at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (&lt;a href="https://mocacognition.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MoCA&lt;/a&gt;) to measure change. That screening tool scores from 0 to 30 and spans memory, attention, language, and executive functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end, the average rose by almost three points, from 25 (pretest) to 27.7 (posttest). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A score of 25 indicates that further assessment may be required and may reflect mild cognitive impairment, a possible precursor to dementia. A score of 27 or higher is considered normal or healthy with no signs of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/doctors-say-this-lifestyle-factor-smoking-is-biggest-contributor-to-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-making-the-brain-work-harder"&gt;Making the brain work harder&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The significant improvement in MoCA scores from pre-test to post-test suggests that retro walking positively influences &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cardiorespiratory-fitness-linked-to-greater-cognitive-performance/"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has indicated that engaging in dual-task exercises, such as walking while maintaining balance, stimulates cognitive processing and enhances &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/executive-function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;executive function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Retro-walking demands increased attention and coordination, potentially explaining the observed cognitive improvements,” the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to doctors at &lt;a href="https://www.ucla.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;, “The precise connection between retro walking and improved cognition is not yet clear. However, researchers suspect that the increased complexity of the physical aspects of the process somehow support the data processing centers of the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That perspective fits what many trainers see in practice: when a task requires balance, orientation, and foot placement, the brain steps up its control systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding a novel pattern – like moving backward – keeps you alert without needing fancy equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joint-health-and-retro-walking"&gt;Joint health and retro walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies report that backward walking can strengthen back and ankle muscles, improve hamstring strength and flexibility, enhance balance, posture, and coordination, and ease lower-back pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the knees and hips move through a smaller range of motion, retro walking can be easier on those joints. These mechanical shifts change how forces travel through the legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing direction alters co-contraction patterns in the quadriceps and hamstrings and can reduce compressive stress under the kneecap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result can be less irritation while still getting the benefits of steady movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-knee-osteoarthritis-trial"&gt;Inside the knee osteoarthritis trial&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A randomized controlled trial examined adults with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507884/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;knee osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. The team recruited 68 people and divided them at random into three groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone received a standard physiotherapy program with familiar strengthening moves – straight-leg raises, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/standing-still-exercises-beat-running-for-blood-pressure-control/"&gt;isometric&lt;/a&gt; quadriceps squeezes, and semi-squats – plus a brief ultrasound warm-up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One group added backward walking. One group added forward walking. A control group did physiotherapy only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training ran three days a week for six weeks. Each session included a warm-up, 10 minutes of supervised walking at a comfortable speed, and a cooldown. If pain stayed low, participants could build toward 30 minutes across the six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers tracked four outcomes before and after: knee pain on a 0–10 scale; function with the &lt;a href="https://www.sralab.org/rehabilitation-measures/western-ontario-and-mcmaster-universities-osteoarthritis-index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WOMAC questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; (lower scores indicate better function); quadriceps strength measured with a handheld dynamometer; and performance on the Timed Up and Go test (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/media/pdfs/steadi-assessment-tug-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TUG assessment&lt;/a&gt;) – standing up, walking about 10 feet, turning, walking back, and sitting down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-positive-study-results"&gt;Positive study results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All groups improved. The backward-walking group moved ahead of the control group on several measures. They cut pain scores more than the control group and also showed larger gains in function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retro walking group’s quadriceps strength increased by about one kilogram on dynamometer testing compared with the control group. They also shaved more time off the Timed Up and Go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall safety outcomes were favorable, as the retro walking team reported no serious adverse events. A few people in the forward-walking group noticed a mild uptick in pain, and therapists adjusted &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/time-in-nature-can-reshape-who-you-are-bring-inner-peace-eudaimonic-well-being/"&gt;walking time&lt;/a&gt; and exercise load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At six weeks, researchers found no statistically significant difference between backward and forward walking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That suggests adding regular, supervised walking – of either kind – to a solid therapy program can deliver meaningful benefits over physiotherapy alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also signals the need for longer or larger trials to determine whether backward walking offers an advantage beyond standard forward walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adding-retro-walking-to-your-routine"&gt;Adding retro walking to your routine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, retro walking requires attention and coordination, which is why it is believed to improve overall brain cognition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cognition study used a flat surface, a steady pace, and professional supervision to prevent falls, then increased intensity step by step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex responds when tasks demand planning and control. Backward walking is a simple way to add that demand to a daily routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MoCA shift from 25 to 27.7 shows how training can move someone from a score that flags possible mild cognitive impairment toward a range considered healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For joint health, altering direction changes the load on the knees and ankles while keeping you active. The osteoarthritis trial links that change to better function, less pain, stronger quadriceps, and faster get-up-and-go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no serious adverse events reported and flexible progression up to 30 minutes, the approach aligns with everyday therapy goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study details are easy to follow: flat surface, steady pace, gradual progression, short intervals, and consistent practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With those pieces in place, retro walking offers a safe, low-tech way to challenge the brain, fine-tune coordination, and keep the body moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full studies referenced in this article were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-019-2537-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.jmgumst.com/journalDetails/JMGUMST" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Mahatma Gandhi University of Medical Sciences and Technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 23:30:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOemZWeGhscXhzNlBXMU04LUVRaHByaUJCUVpXM2RTVE14YXRobmRidTN5T0dhbXBxVUxCWVFXYUFMbjdlcTU1Y3FMMlhxcmtXTlluSFNfVVluMTUxa1hUdVgxZnVfcFQ5dWoyYXQtVlVqNTRYcV9qU1FFcGhLRzVOYldmTVJyQ1FrcVJyZE1qLXN6TFgtX3N1Y0g0R29BdklBTW9ObDQ2M0FoSHM</guid></item><item><title>如何在华盛顿特区、马里兰州或弗吉尼亚州接种新冠疫苗，以及发生了哪些变化-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/09/24/covid-vaccine-dc-maryland-virginia/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="topper-text-elems" class="wpds-c-hoLCKW wpds-c-hoLCKW-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-topper" class="wpds-c-cBzrLX wpds-c-cBzrLX-cmVlgk-isCenterNS-false wpds-c-cBzrLX-iyHTpF-useUATStyles-true wpds-c-cBzrLX-ijmcQMb-css"&gt;&lt;h1 id="main-content" data-qa="headline" data-testid="headline" class="wpds-c-eRlesA wpds-c-eRlesA-dHdMuz-isOnSplitTopper-false wpds-c-eRlesA-bAbYzz-isStyle-false wpds-c-eRlesA-iPJLV-css"&gt;How to get covid vaccine in D.C., Maryland or Virginia, and what has changed&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p data-qa="subheadline" data-testid="subheadline" class="wpds-c-ckOSsQ wpds-c-ckOSsQ-iPJLV-css"&gt;D.C. and Maryland have made it easier for pharmacists to give covid shots without a prescription.

They were particularly vulnerable because their age meant they had a heightened risk of severe symptoms: pneumonia, brain infection, seizures or even death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Because they were all under the age of 1, none had been eligible to receive the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The state keeps a stock of post-exposure prophylactic globulin — a treatment that prevents infection&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;after measles exposure — in case a group of people ineligible to receive the vaccine, like the infants, is exposed, Mathis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;However, he added, the treatment must be administered within six days to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“We had until Sunday to get all those individuals and get them the treatment,” he said. “We definitely had to figure things out on the fly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;He said the babies’ families were all notified of the exposure by 10 p.m. Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Working with Intermountain Health and the state’s health department, Bear River health officials were able to offer a clinic Saturday, where nine of the infants’ families accepted the medicine, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The other two babies were referred to an emergency room, he said, to receive the treatment through an IV because of their size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“I view it as a great flow of communication, collaboration in order to help hopefully reduce the spread of the disease in our community,” Mathis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;As of Tuesday, Bear River spokesperson Estee Hunt said none of the babies was exhibiting any measles symptoms. If infected, symptoms typically develop within seven to 14 days, according to Utah health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Post-exposure treatment is limited&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Utah has now seen 41 officially confirmed measles cases this year, four of which were found in the Bear River district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Though the infants received post-exposure treatment, Mathis emphasized the MMR vaccine as a safe, preventative measure &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html"&gt;for those who are eligible.&lt;/a&gt; Pregnant people, for instance, are not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to Utah health officials, the vaccine is 97% effective for those who receive two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The state recommends children receive their first dose on or after their first birthday, and a second when they are 4 to 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The 11 babies who received post-exposure treatment will be on a delayed schedule for the MMR vaccine, Mathis said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Utah epidemiologist Dr. Leisha Nolen noted that while the state has a limited supply of post-exposure treatment that can be used on young infants, it may not have enough in the event of a mass exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 22:25:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE9zaGp0U1VKUWwwcUdpN1FvcVNaZEpnVUxGZUVUZkF1RzdxdXUzTGtiRG0xS2M3dzJpcm5LNjFOWXhwc0hFSFA3WE0wVGxiRG9mVW9odGR4Z282U1RFOEV2Sk92OFRLVUlweGJjVXZGdExFRzlnbWpCd0NEREQ</guid></item><item><title>ECTRIMS 2025 ：更新的麦当劳标准可实现更多MS诊断-今日多发性硬化症新闻</title><link>https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ectrims/2025/09/24/ectrims-2025-updated-mcdonald-criteria-allow-more-ms-diagnoses/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new revisions to the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-diagnosis-mcdonald-criteria/"&gt;McDonald criteria&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS) —  a set of guidelines long used to diagnose the neurodegenerative condition — have increased the proportion of people who can be diagnosed with MS and also allow for earlier diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s according to a new analysis by scientists at the Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia in Spain. The findings were presented by Luca Bollo, a neurologist specialist at the center, at the 41st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), held Sept. 24-26 in Barcelona, Spain, and online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bollo’s talk was titled “&lt;a href="https://distribute.congrex.com/from.storage?image=rqetJOF1YXChDh_STAPoNoChwtcDs07oiJx4d-yJB8_-yPXS6_nTFmPSvRfcbd7I0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Impact of the 2024 McDonald criteria revisions on multiple sclerosis diagnosis: a comparison with the 2017 criteria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS is a disorder marked by inflammation that damages healthy cells in the central nervous system (CNS), which comprises the brain and spinal cord. The McDonald criteria are guidelines used to &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnose MS&lt;/a&gt; based on clinical findings, imaging tests, and laboratory analyses. First published in 2001, the guidelines have been updated several times as scientific understanding of MS has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent update is the 2024 version, which was &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2025/09/18/new-mcdonald-criteria-aim-faster-ms-diagnosis-treatment/"&gt;just published last week&lt;/a&gt;. The 2024 revisions build upon those in a prior update, published in 2017. The aim is making the diagnosis of MS &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/09/25/ectrims-2024-mcdonald-criteria-changes-speed-diagnoses/"&gt;faster and more accurate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2024 updates include several notable changes, such as providing new guidance on interpreting certain imaging findings and biomarker data. A particularly important change, as noted by researchers, is that, in prior versions of the criteria, patients could only be diagnosed if they showed dissemination in time — meaning neurological damage occurring at multiple points in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new revisions, the McDonald criteria no longer require dissemination in time to diagnose MS if enough other signs of the disease are present. This means that patients may not have to wait several months or even years for new disease activity to occur to receive an MS diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2024 revisions to McDonald criteria widen scope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous version of the criteria also assessed neurological damage in just four key regions — three brain areas and the spinal cord. The 2024 update incorporates a fifth region: the optic nerves, which connect the eyes to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the 2024 revisions, MS can now be diagnosed without further testing if at least four of these five regions show disease-typical damage and the patient is experiencing MS-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, under the earlier McDonald criteria, MS could not be diagnosed if only one region showed damage. These newest revisions allow the diagnosis of MS in some situations when only one region is affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show how these changes may impact MS diagnoses moving forward, Bollo and colleagues looked at clinical data from 326 people who were evaluated for suspected MS at their center between January 2022 and March 2025. Among the patients, about two-thirds were female and the average age was 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our objective [was] to compare the impact of the 2017 and 2024 McDonald criteria in a cohort of patients [with] suspected MS, and to evaluate their effect on time to diagnosis,” Bollo said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these patients (73%) were being evaluated for MS because they had experienced an attack of symptoms that clinicians suspected might be an initial &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-flares/"&gt;MS flare&lt;/a&gt;. Of these patients, 74% met the 2024 criteria for a diagnosis of MS. Using the 2017 criteria, 59% of these individuals would have been diagnosed with MS, Bollo noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another 12% of the patients were being evaluated for MS because they’d been experiencing slowly worsening symptoms indicative of progressive MS. With the 2024 criteria, 83% of these patients were diagnosed with MS. According to Bollo, 57% would have been diagnosed with the 2017 criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining 15% of patients were being evaluated because MRI scans had revealed signs of MS-like damage — even though these individuals had no obvious symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2024 update notably includes several changes aimed at making it easier to diagnose MS in such situations. Slightly more than half of these patients were diagnosed with MS according to the latest criteria. Importantly, the analysis found that none of them could have been diagnosed according to the 2017 criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Significantly more patients can now get a definitive MS diagnosis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that every patient who met the 2024 criteria for MS could also be diagnosed according to the earlier 2017 criteria, but the reverse wasn’t true. Overall, significantly more patients could be definitively diagnosed according to the 2024 criteria (72% vs. 50%), the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical analyses revealed that patients evaluated according to the 2024 criteria were 42.7% more likely to be diagnosed with MS, and that the time to diagnosis was significantly faster, by about six months under the 2024 revisions as compared with the earlier 2017 criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bollo concluded that “the 2024 revisions to the McDonald criteria increase the proportion of patients diagnosed with MS by 43%” compared with the prior updates. The scientist also noted that, with these updates, the McDonald criteria “allowed for an earlier diagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that high consumption of soft drinks was linked to both a greater likelihood of major depressive disorder and more severe symptoms, particularly among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect appears tied to an increase in &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; bacteria, which have been linked to depression in earlier studies. These findings suggest nutrition-based interventions could play a role in preventing or treating depressive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender-Specific Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Women consuming sugary drinks had a 17% higher risk of depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbiome Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The bacterium &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; was more abundant in women with high intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Diet and probiotic strategies could help reduce depressive symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DZD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study involving the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD) provides strong evidence that sugary drinks affect not only metabolic but also mental health – especially in women. This effect is probably mediated by the sensitive microbiome of the intestine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is well known, people who regularly consume sugary drinks not only have an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. There is an increasing number of studies that are now showing that soft drinks can also affect mental health. So far, however, it was unclear whether there is a direct relation to major depressive disorder (MDD) and which biological processes might be involved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soft Drink Consumption Associated with Higher Risk of Depression&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, researchers analyzed cross-sectional data from the Marburg-Münster Affective Cohort (MACS). The study examined adults between the ages of 18 and 65 who were recruited from the general population and primary care between 2014 and 2018. The researchers included a total of 932 people, 405 of whom were patients with major depression disorder and 527 were healthy controls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyses showed a correlation between soft drink consumption and both the diagnosis of depression and the severity of the symptoms. This correlation was particularly pronounced in women: Among them, high consumption was associated with a 17% higher probability of depression (odds ratio 1.167) and more severe symptoms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes in the Microbiome as a Key Factor&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how could the effect be conveyed? Here, too, the study provides a possible explanation: In women who regularly drank sugary soft drinks, the researchers found a significantly increased number of bacteria of the &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; genus in the intestine. Earlier studies had shown that &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; is more common in people with depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study now provides the first convincing evidence that this bacterium possibly plays a mediating role – as a biological link between the consumption of soft drinks and the development of depressive symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data suggests that the relation between soft drinks and depressive symptoms arises via the influence of the microbiome,” says study leader Dr. Sharmili Edwin Thanarajah from the University Hospital Frankfurt and the MPI for Metabolism Research Cologne, an associated partner of the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary drinks such as cola or lemonade not only contain glucose and fructose, but also numerous additives – including preservatives and artificial sweeteners. This combination can disturb the delicate balance in the intestinal microbiome. Inflammation-promoting bacteria are favored, while the production of protective short-chain fatty acids decreases. Animal studies show that such changes can trigger inflammatory processes in the nervous system and thus increase depressive behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is striking that this correlation appears to be sex-related. In men who regularly consumed soft drinks, the researchers found neither an increase in &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; nor a correlation with depressive symptoms. It is still unclear why this effect only occurs in women. Hormonal differences or sex-related reactions of the immune system possibly play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Microbiome as a Therapeutic Target?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study results open up new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of depressive disorders,” comments DZD researcher Rachel Lippert from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbrücke (DIfE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microbiome-based approaches – such as targeted nutritional therapies or probiotic strategies – might help to effectively alleviate depressive symptoms in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers therefore argue that the influence of nutrition on mental health should be more strongly integrated into educational campaigns, care concepts and prevention programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Changes in the microbiome can be influenced by diet – and are therefore a potential therapeutic target,” explains Edwin. “Even small adjustments in consumer behavior might have a big impact – especially when considering the widespread consumption of soft drinks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and microbiome research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b0ded9d5c3d9ded7f0d4cad49dd5c69ed4d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Birgit Niesing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="ttpsw://dzd-ev.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DZD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Birgit Niesing – DZD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.2579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The bitter taste of sweet drinks: Increased consumption of soft drinks is linked to depression via gut microbiota alterations&lt;/a&gt;” by Sharmili Edwin Thanarajah et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bitter taste of sweet drinks: Increased consumption of soft drinks is linked to depression via gut microbiota alterations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soft drink consumption is linked to negative physical and mental health outcomes, but its association with major depressive disorder (MDD) and the underlying mechanisms remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the association between soft drink consumption and MDD diagnosis and severity and whether this association is mediated by changes in the gut microbiota, particularly &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hungatella&lt;/em&gt; abundance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This multicenter cohort study was conducted in Germany using cross-sectional data from the Marburg-Münster Affective Cohort. Patients with MDD and healthy controls (aged 18-65 years) recruited from the general population and primary care between September 2014 and September 2018 were analyzed. Data analyses were conducted between May and December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary analyses included multivariable regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models examining the association between soft drink consumption and MDD diagnosis and symptom severity, controlling for site and education, and &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hungatella&lt;/em&gt; abundance, controlling for site, education, and library size. Mediation analyses tested whether microbiota abundance mediated the soft drink–MDD link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 405 patients with MDD (275 female patients [67.9%]; mean [SD] age, 36.37 [13.33] years) and 527 healthy controls (345 female controls [65.5%]; mean [SD] age, 35.33 [13.13] years) were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soft drink consumption predicted MDD diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.081; 95% CI, 1.008-1.159; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .03) and symptom severity (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001; partial η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [ηp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;], 0.012; 95% CI, 0.004-0.035), with stronger effects in women (diagnosis: OR, 1.167; 95% CI, 1.054-1.292; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .003; severity: &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001; ηp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.036; 95% CI, 0.011-0.062).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In women, consumption was linked to increased &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .007; ηp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.017; 95% CI, 0.0002-0.068), but not &lt;em&gt;Hungatella&lt;/em&gt; abundance. Mediation analyses confirmed that &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; significantly mediated the soft drink–MDD association (diagnosis: &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .011; severity: &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .005), explaining 3.82% and 5.00% of the effect, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this cohort study, it was found that soft drink consumption may contribute to MDD through gut microbiota alterations, notably involving &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt;. Public health strategies to reduce soft drink intake may help mitigate depression risk, especially among vulnerable populations; in addition, interventions for depression targeting the microbiome composition appear promising.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 21:38:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5oajZ4a2FqeldiakplZzJCM1puU2huS1dHSU5XN0dxbE56WGtMX3h5ZVFreXExMmItZzd0SUhLeGpyWlZFa0ZzOHY0d21pbU84bjlWaFZBSm5mVWFVeDNpYVBrTWpPVzFqbk9DcWJNaw</guid></item><item><title>可能正在滴答作响的健康定时炸弹的鲜为人知的疾病...需要注意的迹象-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15130311/peripheral-artery-disease-wounds-foot-not-heal.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A little-known disease that could be a ticking health time bomb may be revealed by changes on your feet, doctors have warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peripheral artery disease, or PAD, is a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14412827/feet-problem-change-silent-killer-heart-disease.html"&gt; serious condition&lt;/a&gt; in which narrowed or blocked arteries restrict blood flow to the legs and feet. Suffered by an estimated 21million Americans, the condition raises the risk of death from heart attack or stroke and is the leading cause of preventable limb amputations in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients do not have noticeable symptoms in the early stages, however, and often dismiss signs like discomfort, fatigue or pain in the legs as signs of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when the disease progresses, doctors warned Daily Mail that patients may have sores on the toes or feet that do not heal or only heal slowly, a warning sign of the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Mounir Haurani, a vascular surgeon at the Society for Vascular Surgery, told this website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 'This is one of the signs of more advanced disease, and indicates a worsening limb-threatening problem such as developing tissue loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'These sores will often&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; start off as a small blister, but then progress into a crater or ulcer where the skin is open and there is exposed soft tissue underneath. It may be a pink or yellowish crater.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He added: 'They are often present on the nailbed and end of the toe, but the other place that people can have them is on the pads of the toes or foot.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About one in 20 Americans suffer from the condition, estimates suggest, but three in four do not realize they have the disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors are warning patients to be on the lookout for subtle changes in their feet that could indicate peripheral artery disease (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It tends to be diagnosed among those over 65 years old, with people who have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity or who smoke being most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among patients, about 33 percent die within five years, estimates suggest, while 20 percent experience a heart attack or stroke and 150,000 suffer an amputation annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Haurani added: 'This disease is a very common problem in the US, and worldwide. It is a very large part of a vascular surgeon's practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Often, we do manage to see patients before the non-healing wounds are present, but in my practice, here in North Carolina, I tend to see this symptom more often.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the condition often does not trigger clear symptoms, in earlier stages, patients may lose hair on the lower leg and foot or that area may feel colder than other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors warn that the foot may also appear paler or have lighter, shinier skin, while the calf muscle may also thin over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, the condition can also cause burning or cramping sensations in the toes and feet, as well as pain in the leg while at rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors say early symptoms of the disease, like fatigue, can be shrugged off or mistaken for other signs like aging (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease progresses in two stages, with symptoms either advancing rapidly or taking months to move from early to late-stage warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat the disease, Dr Haurani said physicians may recommend lifestyle changes such as walking more, eating a healthy diet and quitting smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, patients will also be offered surgery to widen arteries and fully restore blood flow to the lower part of the foot and the leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients may also be prescribed statins and cholesterol-lowering medications to reduce the risk of clots forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Haurani added: 'We estimated 70 percent of Americans have never heard of this disease, so just knowing what it is and that it exists as a problem are the first steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But it is important to say that, despite the risks, it can be managed operatively and patients can live a long, happy and healthy life with the disease as long as it is managed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Celebrity Phylicia Rashad, who played a leading role in The Cosby Cowboys, spoke publicly in 2007 about the impact the disease had on her family, saying she had eight family members, including her father and grandparents, who were diagnosed with the disease. Each died from a heart attack or a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease differs from varicose vein insufficiency, which President Donald Trump was diagnosed with, because peripheral artery disease affects the arteries rather than the veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Haurani said it was possible to prevent the disease via walking just 20 to 30 minutes per day, eating a healthy diet and avoiding smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The revelation came amid Peripheral Artery Disease Awareness Month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 21:25:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPOTRHWFJXbk0xLUk0dDVRZmFXb2ZkbXJnOXltUlR0SUt3TFJ1OVF6OTVNNU1hY0ZEZVRxWXJMbnBnNFFUM0dYT093WGZGSDZwV3ZXUElEbkIzRWx2V2ZoTjN6dktxdDdyenBLV2xfN1UyazNkRHBQMkZibWJIM3lnNFFqbUs2elgzYTIxV012LVRKRGZrRkw0RDE0am12bVFuTnNwdi1B0gGrAUFVX3lxTE12UXpydUsyalJhb0ZHeXJqZmtTb000MmRIc1JhcE1UdEtzWDFQbnFxWlh5YWFGdjk4QUdHQXcxQm4zTF9MTkRIN3NfTThvenZRVEE0VlNoRm5laEZDLUlxekpib0xReEhnSEhYRWJ4WGRjR3NEa2ZoUkdyMzBNWVlqQmsyckdIeFdUTDJORzBZMU52UktLbjBFemlUejcydUQ1M2NIamNMY3J0Yw</guid></item><item><title>初步但有希望的基因治疗显示亨廷顿舞蹈症进展减少75% - ABC新闻-突发新闻、最新新闻和视频</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/preliminary-promising-gene-therapy-shows-75-reduction-huntingtons/story?id=125904128</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;A one-time gene therapy treatment has shown remarkable success in slowing the progression of Huntington's disease in a preliminary trial, according to a press release from &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/about"&gt;University College London (UCL).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The experimental treatment, called AMT-130, reduced disease progression by 75% over three years in patients who received a high dose, compared to those on standard care, according to researchers.

Children of affected parents have a 50% chance of inheriting the condition, according to the press release. The disease typically appears in mid-adulthood, causing problems with movement, memory, and mood, and usually progresses over 15-20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The new therapy works by using a harmless virus to deliver special genetic instructions to the brain, researchers said. These instructions help turn off the harmful protein that damages brain cells. Unlike current treatments that only manage symptoms, AMT-130 is designed to be a one-time treatment that lasts a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I am thrilled that this study showed statistically significant effects on disease progression," professor Sarah Tabrizi, lead scientific advisor for the trial at UCL, said in the announcement. She added that the treatment could help patients "preserve daily function and keep them working longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study included 29 patients, with 12 receiving a high dose of the drug over three years. Scientists measured the treatment's success through brain scans and by testing spinal fluid for signs of brain cell damage, which showed significant improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;While the results are encouraging, experts caution that larger studies are needed. The treatment requires complex brain surgery to deliver the therapy directly to affected areas.

    &lt;p&gt;As the fall respiratory season approaches and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-covid-19-hepatitis-b-vaccines/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;differing recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for children's COVID-19 and flu shots cause confusion, who should be getting vaccinated to protect against illness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-acip-recap-measles-mmrv-covid-vaccines/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;voted to change recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACIP's recommendations are not the final say — they must be reviewed and approved by the CDC director to become official guidance. But CDC directors have almost always accepted the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's where recommendations currently stand.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Flu shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidance on the flu shot for kids is consistent across top medical groups: Children 6 months and older are generally advised to get the shot. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;everyone 6 months and older&lt;/a&gt; get a flu vaccine every season, with rare exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32712/AAP-releases-2025-26-flu-vaccine-recommendations?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; (AAP) also recommends that everyone 6 months and older without medical contradictions get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-safety/vaccine-pregnant.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, flu shots — specifically the injection, not &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flumist-vaccine-nasal-spray-home-cost-age/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;the nasal spray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — are also recommended by both the CDC and AAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting kids from the flu is important because infections can lead to hospitalizations and sometimes be deadly, the CDC says. During the 2023-24 flu season, for example, the CDC reported&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-flu-deaths-children.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2023-2024/2023-2024-flu-deaths-children.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;nearly 200 flu-related deaths among&lt;/a&gt; children in the U.S. Most of them were eligible for a vaccine but were not fully vaccinated, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu season typically starts in December and peaks in February, so the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-to-get-flu-shot-2024/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;optimal time to get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is heading into the season,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;doctors say. It takes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/flu.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20everyone%206%20months,protection%20to%20develop%20after%20vaccination." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;about 2 weeks for protection&lt;/a&gt; to develop after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;COVID vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the COVID-19 vaccine, advice currently varies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; says parents of healthy children ages 6 months to 17 years old should discuss the benefits with a health care provider and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-kids-covid-19-vaccine-recommendation/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;"may receive"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; it, but the agency &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;stops short of recommending the shot&lt;/a&gt;. The agency broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-shot-recommendations-american-academy-of-pediatrics-cdc/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, however, recently shared &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medical-organizations-kicked-out-cdc-vaccine-workgroups-acip/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that, for the first time in three decades, differ from U.S. government advice. In &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585?_gl=1*x6sa7g*_ga*NzAzODcyMjAyLjE3NTU2MDg3MzY.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NTU2MDg3MzYkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTU2MDg3NjIkajM0JGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*NTkzNjQ2NDkxLjE3NTU2MDg3NTM.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NTU2MDg3NTQkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTU2MDg3NjIkajUyJGwwJGgw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the guidance&lt;/a&gt;, the AAP is "strongly recommending" COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years old. For older children, shots are also advised but it's up to parents' discretion, the AAP said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other top medical groups have also shared recommendations differing from the CDC's advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/ID-topics/infectious-disease/covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/a&gt;, a medical association representing physicians and scientists who specialize in infectious diseases, recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a group of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-hawaii-oregon-washington-vaccines-covid-west-coast-health-alliance-cdc/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;four West Coast states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has joined together to issue recommendations on COVID-19 shots and other vaccines that differ from CDC guidance. &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/IMM-1481.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The West Coast Health Alliance&lt;/a&gt; recommends the COVID vaccine for all children 6 months to 23 months old and those 2 to 18 years old with risk factors or who have never been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made last week in a joint statement from Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, all Democrats, saying they were putting safety before politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Northeast, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-vaccine-recommendations-states-public-health/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;New York and its neighbors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; created the &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2025/announce-northeast-public-health-collaborative.page" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Northeast Public Health Collaborative&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/covid-vaccine-kathy-hochul-executive-order/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; calling it a rebuke to Washington's retreat from science. The voluntary coalition includes New York state, New York City, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every resident will have access to the COVID vaccine, no exceptions," Hochul said in &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-issues-covid-19-vaccine-guidance-new-yorkers-partnership-northeast-public" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;, which advises vaccinations for children 6 months to 18 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;CDC advisory panel's proposed COVID changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC's advisory committee, the ACIP, has undergone changes in recent months, with &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-names/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;all new members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-cdc-acip-members-covid-vaccine-critics/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;picked by&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is known for &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-cdc-acip-members-covid-vaccine-critics/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;raising doubts about vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their latest meeting, the ACIP voted for people to make individual, informed decisions about COVID vaccination, and it declined to specifically recommend COVID vaccination. This is a change from current guidance, since it drops recommendations for even children at high risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated recommendations, which are not yet considered official but are expected to be soon, would include the following for children:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individuals 6 months to 64 years: Vaccination based on individual-based decision-making — with an emphasis that the risk-benefit of vaccination is most favorable for individuals who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease and lowest for individuals who are not at an increased risk, according to the CDC list of COVID-19 risk factors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit&lt;/a&gt; — a vaccine researcher at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a former government adviser who has sparred with Kennedy for years — said that with this proposed change, "the good news is anyone can get the vaccine." But "the bad news is that no one is encouraged to get it even if you're in a high-risk group," he recently told The Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varying advice has already &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccines-child-immunization-recommendations-parents/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;caused confusion for parents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said he expects confusion around the COVID vaccine due to the panel's recent vote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I think it means is that people are going to be uncertain whether or not the COVID-19 vaccine is a benefit to them," he &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/cdc-vaccine-panel-says-covid-19-shots-individual-choice/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;told CBS News on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/what-parents-need-to-know-as-vaccination-rates-for-kids-continue-to-decline/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Dr. Céline Gounder&lt;/a&gt;, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, says there's "a lot of noise out there" when it comes to vaccines, but advises parents to "stick the course" and talk to your doctor about making sure children get all their necessary vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

            The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/han00524.html" target="_blank"&gt;issued a new health advisory&lt;/a&gt; about the latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Thirty-seven confirmed cases and 19 deaths have been reported as of September 18 during this outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7ba000h3b6nctiw7fd2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC also issued a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/ebola-democratic-republic-of-the-congo" target="_blank"&gt;travel health notice&lt;/a&gt; on September 8 for Congo, recommending that travelers to the affected health zones avoid contact with ill people and monitor themselves for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of Ebola while in the outbreak area and for 21 days after leaving.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What is Ebola — what causes it, what are the symptoms and how dangerous is it? How is the disease spread? What treatments are available? Is there a vaccine? And what should people know about this outbreak and why the CDC has issued alerts?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To help us answer these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7ba000k3b6nxn5ra7mn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What is Ebola, and what causes it?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7ba000l3b6nxbfifz64@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Ebola is a serious illness with a high fatality rate in humans. The average case fatality rate is around 50%, meaning 1 in 2 infected people will die, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-disease" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7ba000m3b6nrqwam8yl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ebola is caused by a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;group of viruses&lt;/a&gt; that are part of the Orthoebolavirus family. They were discovered in 1976 in what is now Congo. In addition to the Ebola virus, which causes Ebola virus disease, there are also the Sudan virus, Bundibugyo virus and Taï Forest virus that can cause severe illness in humans.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7ba000n3b6npgzv2pvl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This new outbreak in Congo is caused by Ebola virus. It is the 16th Ebola disease outbreak reported there since 1976.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7ba000o3b6n6lnix11y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What are the symptoms of Ebola, and how soon do they start after exposure?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7ba000p3b6n7jsbwvbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The incubation period for Ebola disease is two to 21 days, but the average time between exposure and symptoms is eight to 10 days. Initially, the patient exhibits “dry” symptoms, such as fever, joint and muscle headaches, severe headache, and fatigue. These are nonspecific symptoms that often lead to misdiagnosis with other illnesses such as influenza, malaria or typhoid fever.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7ba000q3b6n4iov366w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Four to five days after symptom onset, patients can progress to “wet” symptoms that are characteristic of Ebola infection. Specifically, individuals may develop gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea; rash; chest pain; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/ebola" target="_blank"&gt;bleeding&lt;/a&gt; from the eyes, mouth, nose and rectum. The disease may progress to organ failure, seizures, brain inflammation and death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How is Ebola spread?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The primary way is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;person to person&lt;/a&gt;. Someone can be infected if they come in contact with blood or body fluids from an individual who is sick or has died of Ebola. Objects contaminated with an infected person’s fluids can also spread the disease. These items include bedding, utensils, clothes and medical equipment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7ba000t3b6niy0v4nql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Transmission has also been reported through sexual contact, specifically through semen of those who are infected with or have recently recovered from Ebola disease. In addition, humans can contract Ebola from hunting, handling or eating infected animals such as bats, monkeys and antelope.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7ba000u3b6nwxih9oal@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How are Ebola patients treated?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7ba000v3b6nhmvvrktj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients with Ebola disease are immediately isolated to prevent transmission to others. Supportive care is essential and includes giving fluids and electrolytes to replace those lost through illness. If blood pressure or oxygen levels fall, intensive care is required to stabilize circulation and breathing. Patients may also need treatment for secondary infections or for complications related to preexisting conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7ba000w3b6n7mdedxy4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/hcp/clinical-guidance/index.html#:~:text=Treatment%20options&amp;amp;text=Two%20treatments%20are%20approved%20by,is%20a%20single%20monoclonal%20antibody." target="_blank"&gt;Two treatments&lt;/a&gt; are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat Ebola virus disease: a combination of three monoclonal antibodies, and a single monoclonal antibody. In &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12079879/" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10375381/#:~:text=Patients%20treated%20with%20REGN%2DEB3,51.3%25)." target="_blank"&gt;these therapies&lt;/a&gt; were shown to reduce mortality, although the death rate remains high even with treatment. Because these medicines are costly and logistically challenging to deliver, access to them is limited, particularly for patients in sub-Saharan Africa, where most Ebola outbreaks occur.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7ba000x3b6nu03ltbzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Is there a vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvnboon000e3b6nx2am4wxl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. The FDA approved a vaccine, Ervebo, against Ebola virus disease in &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-issues/ebola" target="_blank"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/ebola-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;second vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is authorized in Europe but not available in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7ba000z3b6nhd3mml4a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ervebo is designed for use during outbreaks as part of a strategy called “ring vaccination&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This approach involves vaccinating people at the highest risk of infection, such as those in close contact with confirmed Ebola patients, the contacts of those contacts, and frontline health care workers. By creating a “ring” of protection around cases, the goal is to contain the spread of the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7bb00103b6n7jammyvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to WHO, &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/democratic-republic-of-congo/news/ebola-vaccination-begins-democratic-republic-congo" target="_blank"&gt;an initial 400 doses&lt;/a&gt; of Ervebo have already been deployed to one of the outbreak hotspots in Congo; additional doses are being delivered in the coming days.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7bb00113b6nf9yumoh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What else should people know about the outbreak? Why is the CDC issuing alerts?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7bb00123b6n6cps50jm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; While Ebola is a deadly disease and it is crucial that public health resources be deployed to help Congo, this outbreak has not affected the US so far. As the CDC says, no suspected, probable or confirmed Ebola virus disease cases related to the current outbreak have been reported in the US or outside Congo. At this time, the risk of spread to the US is low.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7bb00133b6nf4cch64b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC’s notice for travelers to Congo recommends avoiding contact with ill individuals during travel and monitoring for symptoms until 21 days after leaving the area. People who develop symptoms must immediately isolate themselves and call their doctor or local health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7bb00143b6nwnpd60kc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Issuing a health advisory alerts clinicians to consider Ebola in patients who have concerning symptoms and who have recently traveled to infected areas. The advisory also provides resources for hospitals, laboratories and public health departments that may be involved in treating patients, handling and testing specimens, or responding to community questions about Ebola.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7bb00153b6ng1yar5ag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are there other recommendations for the public now?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfvld7bb00163b6n56swy7aw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; There are no special recommendations for the general public outside the regions where Ebola virus is present. For people living in or visiting affected areas, however, taking precautions is essential. Avoid contact not only with people who are ill but also with anything that may be contaminated by their body fluids. In addition, do not visit any health care facilities unless you have an urgent medical need.

            Traditional burial practices that involve touching the body of the deceased should be avoided. Also avoid bats, monkeys and forest antelope, and do not enter caves or mines where bats may live. Finally, anyone who develops symptoms should isolate immediately and seek medical care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of U.S. adults—particularly those under 40—are reporting serious challenges with memory, concentration and decision-making, according to a new study published in &lt;i&gt;Neurology&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"Challenges with memory and thinking have emerged as a leading health issue reported by U.S. adults," said study author Adam de Havenon, MD, MS, of Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study shows that these difficulties may be becoming more widespread, especially among younger adults, and that social and structural factors likely play a key role."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from over 4.5 million survey responses from adults collected annually between 2013 and 2023. Participants were asked, "Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?" Those who answered "yes" were classified as having a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+disability/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive disability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers excluded responses from people who reported depression, along with data from the year 2020 due to the unique impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate of cognitive disability in the U.S. rose from 5.3% in 2013 to 7.4% in 2023, with the first increase appearing in 2016. The largest increase was among adults aged under 40. For this group, the rate nearly doubled—climbing from 5.1% to 9.7%. In contrast, rates among those age 70 and older declined slightly, from 7.3% in 2013 to 6.6% over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the survey is not a measure of cognitive impairment, de Havenon noted the growing prevalence of self-reported cognitive disability in younger adults reflects important public health trends.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Researchers found adults with household incomes below $35,000 consistently reported the highest rates—rising from 8.8% to 12.6% over the study period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, those with incomes over $75,000 had substantially lower rates, increasing only from 1.8% to 3.9%. For education, rates among adults without a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high+school+diploma/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high school diploma&lt;/a&gt; rose from 11.1% to 14.3% while rates among &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/college+graduates/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;college graduates&lt;/a&gt; rose from 2.1% to 3.6% over the study period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most of the respondents were white, rates rose across nearly all racial and ethnic groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American Indian and Alaska Native adults: highest prevalence, from 7.5% to 11.2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hispanic adults: from 6.8% to 9.9%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black adults: from 7.3% to 8.2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White adults: from 4.5% to 6.3%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asian adults: from 3.9% to 4.8%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest we're seeing the steepest increases in memory and thinking problems among people who already face structural disadvantages," de Havenon said. "We need to better understand and address the underlying social and economic factors that may be driving this trend."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More research is also needed to understand what's driving the large increase in rates among younger adults, given the potential long-term implications for health, workforce productivity and health care systems," de Havenon continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It could reflect actual changes in brain health, better awareness and willingness to report problems, or other health and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/social+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;social factors&lt;/a&gt;. But regardless of possible causes, the rise is real—and it's especially pronounced in people under 40."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that data was gathered through telephone surveys and people providing responses may not have recalled all information accurately. Another limitation was the broad definition of disability.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A book of mechanical actions is a wondrous thing — mechanically inclined children have lost collective decades pouring over them over the generations. What could possibly be better? Why, if the mechanisms in the book were present, and moved! That’s exactly what &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPqE28IUkw" target="_blank"&gt;[AxelMadeIt] produced for a recent video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being just four pages, you might argue this is but a pamphlet. But since it takes up a couple inches of shelf space, it certainly looks like a book from the outside, which is exactly what [AxelMadeIt] was going for. To get a more book-like spine, his hinge design sacrificed opening flat, but since the pages are single-sided, that’s no great sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At only 6 mm (1/4″) thick, finding printable mechanisms that could actually fit inside was quite a challenge. If he was machining everything out of brass, that would be room for oodles of layers. But [Axel] wanted to print the parts for this book, so the mechanisms need to be fairly thick. One page has a Roberts linkage and a vault-locking mechanism, another has planetary gears, with angled teeth to keep them from falling out. Finally, the first page has a &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2012/04/01/a-little-geneva-drive-made-of-wood/"&gt;geneva mechanism&lt;/a&gt;, and an escarpment, both driven by a &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/11/03/3d-printing-belts-for-vintage-hardware/"&gt;TPU belt drive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All pages are driven from an electric motor that is buried in the last page of the “book”, along with its motor, battery, and a couple of micro-switches to turn it on when you open the book and off again when you reach the last page. Rather than a description of the mechanisms, like most books of mechanical actions, [Axel] used multi-material printing to put lovely poems on each page. A nice pro-tip is that “Futura”, a font made famous by flying to the moon, works very well when printed this way. If you just want to watch him flip through, jump to 8:00 in the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds us of another project we once featured, &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/02/29/2100-mechanical-mechanisms/"&gt;which animated 2100 mechanical mechanisms&lt;/a&gt;. While this book can’t offer near that variety, it makes up for it in tactility.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of commercial raw cat foods has detected disease-causing microbes, including some that are resistant to antibiotics, creating risks for both pets and their owners, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08756-8" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/i&gt;, found Salmonella, Cronobacter and E. coli in such foods as raw or partially cooked meat sold frozen, refrigerated and freeze-dried in stores and online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These pathogens can transfer from pets to humans and are of special concern for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/young+children/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;young children&lt;/a&gt;, and people who are old, pregnant and immuno-compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most of these products have no warning labels on them showing that the meat ingredients are not fully cooked, indicating that they could harbor live bacteria and potentially viruses and parasites that would make a family very sick," said Laura Goodman, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Public and Ecosystem Health and in the Baker Institute for Animal Health in the College of Veterinary Medicine. "Particularly for the freeze-dried products sold on shelves, consumers likely have no idea they are taking on that risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodman is senior author of the paper; Guillaume Reboul, a former postdoctoral researcher in Goodman's lab, is the first author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration regulates and tests a limited number of bacteria in raw cat foods, due to compliance policies, which mainly focus on human pathogens. The paper provides evidence of a wider range of pathogens found in raw cat foods that might be used to inform the agency's future policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers purchased a mix of raw and conventionally cooked cat foods. They then compared the communities of microorganisms, known as microbiomes, in each sample, applying the same methods practiced by the FDA when they cultured bacterial samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team detected five strains of Salmonella in raw food samples, which they uploaded to the federal database that is used to match with human cases of salmonellosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There were indeed some human cases that were genetically very similar to our isolates," revealing that people potentially were sickened from the same products studied, Goodman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also applied nonstandard culturing methods and isolated antibiotic-resistant pseudomonas, a bacteria that can cause serious, life-threatening lung, blood and urinary tract infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klebsiella, a bacteria that can cause fever, chills and fatigue, and potentially pneumonia and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/urinary+tract+infections/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;urinary tract infections&lt;/a&gt;, was also found in raw samples, though it is not necessarily considered a foodborne pathogen, Goodman said. Clostridium perfringens, the bacteria that leads to gastroenteritis in undercooked turkey, and causes food poisoning around Thanksgiving, was highly associated with the microbiomes of the freeze-dried cat treats and coated kibble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial DNA fingerprinting of the ingredients found in raw cat food confirmed some labels did not match the types of meat listed in the products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We did find some discrepancies in the labeling across all formulations, not just the raw food," Goodman said. Some products contained chicken even though that ingredient was missing from the label. Some cat owners try to avoid feeding their cats chicken, which is often used as a filler, because it can carry avian influenza, which is deadly for cats. Indeed, another fatality linked to raw cat food was recently reported in California.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Sexually transmitted disease rates for U.S. adults fell last year, but syphilis in newborns continued to rise, according to new government data posted Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;provisional data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for 2024 showed a third consecutive year of fewer gonorrhea cases, and the second year in a row of fewer adult cases of chlamydia and the most infectious forms of syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But congenital syphilis cases, in which infected moms pass the disease to their babies, aren’t seeing the same improvements. Such infections in infants can lead to deaths or lifelong health problems such as deafness, blindness, and malformed bones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number and rate of newborn cases has been rising since 2012, when about 300 were reported, and last year rose to nearly 4,000. The 2024 increases was &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/syphilis-newborns-cdc-std-testing-25df6e6352508fce37fb20ac10770124"&gt;not as steep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as in other years — cases were up by less than 2% &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/syphilis-gonorrhea-chlamydia-cdc-e8bfcfd0ada922c894b38a6e5dbdec5b"&gt;from 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. But health experts say no cases should be happening, and any growth is worrisome.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“The continued rise in congenital syphilis is a distressing indication that we are not doing enough to protect pregnant women and newborns,” said Elizabeth Finley, interim executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 1.5 million chlamydia cases, 543,000 of gonorrhea, and more than 190,000 of syphilis were diagnosed and reported last year. Each was lower than the year before, and the more than 2.2 million total cases represented a 9% decline from 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Overall decreases in sexually transmitted diseases in recent years have a lot to do with a general decline in young people having new partners, said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the drop in adult syphilis cases is generally attributed to the growing use of the antibiotic &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/stds-doxycycline-pills-635aa358871bd67088573f0ecdc01ec9"&gt;doxycycline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/doxycycline-std-morning-after-pill-cdc-20a087e32c4a81f7c3413363e6255785"&gt;morning-after pill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, specifically for gay and bisexual men and transgender women who recently had an STD diagnosis. Cases of primary and secondary syphilis, the disease’s most infectious stages, fell 22% last year, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The new data suggests that the improvement in some groups has not yet played out in obstetrics wards. There are several possible factors, but one could be that only 80% of pregnant women are getting screened for syphilis, according to a recent CDC &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://journals.lww.com/stdjournal/abstract/2025/05000/syphilis_screening_during_pregnancy_in_18__to.5.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    &lt;div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-2"&gt;&lt;p class="featurephoto-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Local drug overdose rates fell by approximately 38 percent between 2023 and 2024, according to the Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). | Chart: DHHS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New data from the Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Public Health Branch shows a significant decrease in opioid overdose deaths over the last two years — the lowest numbers reported since 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a biennial update on the county’s syringe exchange program at Tuesday’s Humboldt County Board of Supervisors meeting, Public Health Officer Dr. Candy Stockton largely attributed the decrease in local overdose deaths to increased access to overdose-reversing drugs like naloxone, commonly referred to by the brand name Narcan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our participants have reported nearly 280 overdose reversals in the last year,” Stockton said. “It’s actually critically important if you think about the total number of deaths that we had in Humboldt County from overdoses last year was about 50, [and] looking at how much higher that would have been without the overdose reversals that we had as a result of our naloxone distribution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office &lt;a href="https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2022/feb/22/were-seeing-now-more-ever-fentanyl-overdoses-skyro/"&gt;reported 32 drug overdose deaths in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which ticked up to 53 in 2021. In that same time period, fentanyl overdose deaths increased by 377 percent — jumping from nine in 2020 to 34 in 2021 — launching Humboldt into a &lt;a href="https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2022/dec/10/humboldts-fentanyl-epidemic/"&gt;fentanyl epidemic&lt;/a&gt;. There were over 80 local drug overdose deaths reported in 2022, as seen in the chart above, but that number steadily declined in 2023 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our overdose death rates have been decreasing slowly over the last three years, but we are still losing 50 of our friends, family members and community members to overdose,” Stockton continued. “The numbers for this year look on track to be at that same level or slightly higher this year. This overdose prevention work remains critically important in our community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stockton also reported a “drastic decrease” in the local hepatitis C rates over the last five years, something she attributed, in part, to local syringe exchange programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The combination of both being able to treat and cure hepatitis C and slowing the spread among individuals who are infected has really helped us as a community combat this serious illness,” Stockton said. “[These programs] help reduce the incidence of HIV and hepatitis C transmission, as well as helping to reduce overdose deaths in people who use drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[There is] lots and lots of data going back, showing that [syringe exchange programs] do not increase drug use, as is sometimes a concern for people,” she continued. “We also know that areas that have active syringe service programs across the country have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3358593/"&gt;actually lower incidence of syringe litter in their community&lt;/a&gt;, lower incidence of needle stick injuries for law enforcement officers, and decreased crime levels compared to areas that do not have those programs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following staff’s presentation, Fifth District Supervisor Steve Madrone acknowledged that “we’ve all been touched in our families by addiction and these drugs in one way or another,” and thanked DHHS for their work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the data does show that [these programs are] having a positive effect,” he added. “We’re not Portugal, so we don’t have heroin shops and other kinds of things. We don’t hand out drugs; we hand out equipment to try and make things safer. I mean, there’s some interesting data in countries like Portugal and other places that have taken it to a whole ‘nother level further, but we don’t do that in America.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First District Supervisor Rex Bohn was more skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I appreciate the work you’re doing … [and] I’m just an old man looking here, but we’re going to give away smoking supplies in the unincorporated community so they can smoke an illegal product, but we’re not doing any more tobacco licenses?” he asked rhetorically. “But as we move forward with the fentanyl use, a lot of that is going to be enforcement. … If they can’t get the product, maybe they’re going to think about coming in and getting help with that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Board Chair Michelle Bushnell said she hasn’t been “greatly supportive” of needle exchange programs in the past, due to concerns over monitoring and lenient parameters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not that I don’t agree with the process or the concept, I just wanted some more — I guess more? I don’t know what the word is — I wanted it to be monitored more,” she said. “I do appreciate the work, and I do recognize that the drug overdoses have gone from injectables to more pill form now, which is unfortunate, and hopefully someday we can find solutions for that as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supervisors Natalie Arroyo and Mike Wilson both expressed support for the program, with Wilson making a motion to approve and file the report. The motion passed in a 5-0 vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff’s full presentation can be found &lt;a href="https://humboldt.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;amp;ID=14793708&amp;amp;GUID=82D39A8A-976C-43CB-8749-A432BA48059A"&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;“The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,” said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;It’s likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;That may play out in doctors’ offices across the country, as infections long considered routine — like urinary tract infections — could become harder to treat, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report’s authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more-8" class="taboola-read-more-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them.

That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — a 69% increase. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460%, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/covid-19-pandemic" rel=""&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;“We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,” said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;The CDC’s count is only a partial picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals are also unable to perform the necessary testing to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York, and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections “is definitely underestimated,” Burnham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;This is not the first study to report a rise. A CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7423a2.htm" rel=""&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[SIGN UP: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://membercenter.whio.com/newsletters" target="_self" rel="" title="https://membercenter.whio.com/newsletters"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph body-copyright"&gt;©2025 Cox Media Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WHIO-TV</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 18:51:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPUjhTOV9uYmZaUU9kWGUxaVJJWEYtaGZzVkt3YWcybHlWSTFBTDI4UEJOd2EteVV5Y1pnenVmcm1IZTZVejdZMTF6UDY5THdrVmtxU2JSY2JyaXQxQ1lRS2Y5OFJtc0xrZEg0UkRkOVdscjBXdTVtbXo4cktvQ1ptYlBEcTZSOWpWRmt3VTlfZ256RzlmTTdkT2VkTmphNzRpM01iV9IBuAFBVV95cUxQTF81S3JQYTRzMzA3SzR4R3M5a0I5b0ZQMHJLZDYwU0NjRXJueFRNQlo5TGd0ZWxTSm4tYk5qbUlIZjFqOV95ems2bkwzYl9tWEpwTHl0SVRVN0lsMHBQaHNKX19HVXA1REsxNUJtdXBDM3phMUhKR002cWFPc2FRUDVMdExjdXl6RHhPVUF5TWNFUHp2NHRnQ2hmMXlfOHNvVHRVV21FY2FydEdFeGhhS21CMlZidFRm</guid></item><item><title>世界上最年长的人玛丽亚·布拉尼亚斯·莫雷拉（ Maria Branyas Morera ）是如何活得这么久的？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/health/maria-branyas-longevity-genes-microbiome.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 18:26:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOZ0FJSS05ZlljbGpPZXE5OUNWaWl0aUV0dTdDNEJIVUNNZVBpS1ltZlRSa0FDbnYxSWV1ODJuQ3VwYnFLd00zTDdrYmRpZjNhTkNRNVlmSjFwLVlGbm0zOGRPN3dveEV6UEtJNlQ2YXZCSVpaUXo0cVduVFZKNnloNUo2WHRXeDl2M3dTUTkzNzQ</guid></item><item><title>117岁去世的加泰罗尼亚妇女长寿的秘诀： “学习我，向我学习” - EL PAÍS English</title><link>https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-09-24/the-secrets-to-longevity-of-catalan-woman-who-died-at-117-study-me-learn-from-me.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="a_c clearfix" data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;María Branyas Morera was born on March 4, 1907, in San Francisco, less than a year after the earthquake that destroyed the city.

As a child, she witnessed the &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2014/08/01/inenglish/1406899373_422667.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2014/08/01/inenglish/1406899373_422667.html"&gt;1918 flu pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.

She witnessed &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-05-08/80th-anniversary-of-the-end-of-world-war-ii-how-does-a-country-fall-into-the-abyss-of-hatred.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-05-08/80th-anniversary-of-the-end-of-world-war-ii-how-does-a-country-fall-into-the-abyss-of-hatred.html"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the moon landing in 1968, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the turn of the millennium, and in 2020, she overcame a Covid infection. Over all those years, she lost her parents, her siblings, and even — the cross that most painfully affected her — her son. In 2023, she became the oldest living person on the planet. During the final years of her life, and until shortly before her death in August of last year, a group of scientists took several samples from her. Their results, recently published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/home" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/home"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, reveal the keys to her longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Study me, learn from me,” Manel Esteller recounts María telling him shortly after meeting her. Head of the Cancer Epigenetics group at the Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Esteller is the senior author of this research, in which some 40 scientists participated. He learned from the press that María lived near his laboratory, so he insisted on meeting her and studying her. “She said that when she reached 100, 105, or 108 years old, God had forgotten about her,” he recalls. But she soon regained her optimism. “She said to herself, ‘Look, since I’m here, I’ll do what I can, enjoying my family for as long as I have left,’” Esteller adds, concluding by emphasizing that María was “a very generous, very kind person, always with a smile.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;What the team led by Esteller has done is study the biological basis of María’s longevity and its possible connection to her habits and attitude toward life. On several occasions in recent years, they took samples of her saliva, blood, urine, and stool to perform a multi-omic analysis. The neologism refers to a set of &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-02-23/eduard-batlle-molecular-biologist-tumor-cells-are-high-speed-evolution-machines.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-02-23/eduard-batlle-molecular-biologist-tumor-cells-are-high-speed-evolution-machines.html"&gt;molecular biology tools&lt;/a&gt;. The best known is the analysis of her genome; also popular is the study of her microbiome. Less well-known are the transcriptome (the specific expression of genes), the review of her metabolome (the metabolites resulting from cellular function), proteomics (the field dedicated to proteins), and epigenomics, the field in which Esteller’s team excels. The biology of such an elderly person has never been studied in such depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“María had a very mild case of Covid, and we may now know some of the reasons for that mildness with this study,” says Esteller. One is that she had “a very powerful immune system, very good defense cells,” he explains. &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-01-03/memory-is-not-exclusive-to-the-brain-non-neural-cells-also-remember.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-01-03/memory-is-not-exclusive-to-the-brain-non-neural-cells-also-remember.html"&gt;They had a very long memory&lt;/a&gt;, recalling all the infections she had in her 117 years. “They were still very efficient at attacking microorganisms, but at the same time, they didn’t attack her own tissues, that is, they didn’t induce the inflammation so typical of autoimmune diseases,” he explains. Aside from the deafness in one ear she lived with from a young age, María aged with the typical mobility issues of the elderly, but in the absence of heart problems, tumors, or &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-03-15/nearly-half-of-the-planet-suffers-from-a-neurological-disease.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-03-15/nearly-half-of-the-planet-suffers-from-a-neurological-disease.html"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And yet the first results of this multi-omic analysis of María revealed that the dark side of old age was lurking. One of the markers most closely linked to aging is &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-05-25/why-is-it-so-difficult-to-create-anti-aging-drugs.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-05-25/why-is-it-so-difficult-to-create-anti-aging-drugs.html"&gt;the length of telomeres&lt;/a&gt;, the caps that protect the ends of chromosomes. María’s telomeres were up to 40% shorter compared to a sample of people of all ages. “They were like the tip of a worn-out pencil, with almost nothing left. But despite that, her health was good. This allows us to deduce that telomeres indicate the passage of time, but not the poor health associated with the passage of time,” Esteller emphasizes. This work doesn’t invalidate the connection between telomeres and aging, but it does clarify it. “They’re a stopwatch; they indicate chronological age, that is, she was born in a certain year. But not biological age,” Esteller concludes. Epigenomics is responsible for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;As can be seen in the photograph below, María didn’t look her age. And this isn’t a subjective impression. “If you give me your DNA, I can determine your age thanks to some chemical markers on it.” This is how Eloy Santos, a researcher at the Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and lead author of the study, explains what epigenetic clocks are. Already used in forensic science to determine the age of a victim or their killer, in María’s case they used half a dozen of them. “None of the epigenetic clocks, regardless of the tissue, matched her age. None could in any way predict that this woman was 116 years old,” comments Santos, the member of Esteller’s group who visited María the most. The average obtained from these markers indicated that her biological age was 23 years younger than what her Spanish ID card indicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="a_m a_m-h "&gt;&lt;span class="_db a_m_w _pr lb_btn"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nadie le echaría 101 años a María Branyas en esta imagen de 2008.

Except for deafness and age-related mobility issues, she had no heart disease, tumors, or neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The study of her microbiome confirms this biological youth. By comparing the profile of her &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-07-17/revolution-in-medicine-a-molecule-produced-by-gut-bacteria-causes-atherosclerosis-responsible-for-millions-of-deaths.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-07-17/revolution-in-medicine-a-molecule-produced-by-gut-bacteria-causes-atherosclerosis-responsible-for-millions-of-deaths.html"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt;, now known to be closely linked to physical and mental health, with that of a sample of hundreds of people up to 91 years old, the researchers found it comparable to that of a young person, almost an adolescent. They also found that she maintained a very efficient cholesterol and lipid metabolism. “She had no alterations in her arteries; her pipes were very clean,” Esteller adds. To complete the profile, they detected that she had exceptional mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are responsible for cellular respiration and “in María’s case, they were very good machines for eliminating free radicals and oxidation,” they concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Iñaki Martin-Subero, a researcher at the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies and head of the Biomedical Epigenomics group at IDIBAPS in Barcelona, was not involved in the study of María Branyas’ samples. However, he was familiar with the work of Esteller and his team, which involved scientists from around 20 institutions. “It’s an extremely comprehensive study,” he acknowledges. “With problems like such short telomeres or such accelerated DNA methylation, she wouldn’t have reached 117 years of age if she didn’t have a strong immune system or a microbiome to compensate for the other factors,” he adds. Martín-Subero also highlights elements that aren’t so easily read in genes, proteins, or mitochondria. With the healthy lifestyle she led or all the emotions she must have gone through losing so many relatives, “she had to be a very balanced person, stress-free; it’s not so much what you experience, but how you cope with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Martín-Subero sees a limitation to the work, one that the authors already acknowledge, but essential nonetheless: “The sample is N=1, meaning it sheds light on how María lived so long, but we can’t say that about other centenarians; for that, we would have to study more and from the same environment.” The problem is that there aren’t enough supercentenarians to study. “Cases like María’s are so extraordinary that each of them could have reached such an advanced age through their own path,” he adds, as several other studies have pointed out. The researcher notes another limitation: “Despite being very comprehensive, the study includes data from four types of samples, but not others.” Martín-Subero is referring to María’s tissues or organs. Here, ethics prevailed over scientific interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="a_m a_m-h "&gt;&lt;span class="_db a_m_w"&gt;&lt;img alt="La gráfica muestra el perfil del microbioma intestinal de María Branyas a sus 116 años.

We didn’t study anything that would cause excessive disturbance, because it’s one thing for her to be generous and lend her samples for study, and another thing to take advantage,” Santos clarifies. He agrees that the work would have gone further if they had analyzed María’s samples after she passed away in her sleep, on August 19, 2024, for example, from the neurons in her brain free of neurodegenerative disorders. “If we didn’t want to disturb her further while she was alive, how could we do it afterward? We didn’t do it out of respect for María and the family,” Santos adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Researchers agree on the extraordinary nature of María’s case. Not only because of her biology, but also because of her lack of harmful habits and her great sociability. But Santos doesn’t see this as a limitation; “being so special makes her even more useful to science,” he comments. This usefulness is what led María to allow them to visit and study her. “We have the concept that aging is equivalent to illness and that one thing necessarily goes hand in hand with the other. But this woman has shown us that, to a certain extent, this doesn’t have to be the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" target="_self" rel="" title="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"&gt;&lt;i&gt;our weekly newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EL PAÍS English</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 18:09:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>智商似乎会影响在嘈杂环境中倾听的能力- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-iq-affect-ability-noisy.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're in a bustling café with a friend. The din is making it hard to tune in to the conversation. The scenario might suggest you'd benefit from a hearing aid. On the other hand, new research suggests that speech-perception difficulty might relate to your cognitive ability.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a study of three groups—individuals with autism, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fetal+alcohol+syndrome/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fetal alcohol syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and a "neurotypical" control group—researchers found that cognitive ability was significantly associated with how well the participants, all with typical hearing, processed speech in noisy environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The relationship between cognitive ability and speech-perception performance transcended diagnostic categories. That finding was consistent across all three groups," said the study's lead investigator, Bonnie Lau. She is a research assistant professor in otolaryngology–head and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neck+surgery/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neck surgery&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Washington School of Medicine and directs lab studies of auditory brain development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are published in &lt;i&gt;PLOS One&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lau said upfront that the study's small scale of fewer than 50 participants warrants validation with larger populations. But the findings, she said, demonstrate that intellectual ability is among the variables that influence how well people hear in complex acoustic settings, like lively classrooms and social events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the researchers designed a study that included people with autism and fetal alcohol syndrome. People with those conditions, despite having typical hearing, frequently report difficulty listening in noisy environments. Groups of people with those "neurodivergent" conditions represented a wider range of IQ scores—some of them higher, Lau emphasized—than would be seen among neurotypical participants alone.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The study participants were 12 people with autism, 10 with fetal alcohol syndrome, and 27 age- and biological sex-matched people in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/control+group/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;control group&lt;/a&gt;. They ranged in age from 13 to 47 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All participants first underwent an audiology screening to confirm clinically normal hearing. They were then equipped with headphones and a computer program that posed a complex listening challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were introduced to a primary speaker's voice and instructed to attend to that speaker's voice as two other "background" voices emerged, all speaking simultaneously. The primary speaker's voice was always male, and the secondary voices were male and female or both male. Each voice stated a single sentence that began with a call sign followed by a color and number, for example: "Ready, Eagle, go to green five now."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/computer+program/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;computer program&lt;/a&gt;, study participants were tasked to select a colored, numbered box that corresponded to the primary speaker's statement, while the volume of the secondary voices gradually increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, participants underwent brief, standardized tests of intelligence, including verbal and nonverbal ability, and perceptual reasoning. Those scores were analyzed against individuals' scores on the "multitalker" listening challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found a highly significant relationship between directly assessed intellectual ability and multitalker speech perception," the researchers reported. "Intellectual ability was significantly correlated with speech perception thresholds in all three groups."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;A lot of brain processing contributes to successful listening in complex environments, Lau said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You have to segregate the streams of speech. You have to figure out and selectively attend to the person that you're interested in, and part of that is suppressing the competing noise characteristics. Then you have to comprehend from a linguistic standpoint, coding each phoneme, discerning syllables and words. There are semantic and social skills, too—we're smiling, we're nodding. All these factors increase the cognitive load of communicating when it is noisy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study directly addresses a common misconception, Lau added, that any person who has trouble listening is suffering from peripheral hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You don't have to have a hearing loss to have a hard time listening in a restaurant or any other challenging real-world situation," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors suggested that neurodivergent individuals and individuals with lower cognitive ability could benefit from an assessment of the environments that may challenge their complex listening thresholds. This could lead to helpful classroom interventions, for instance, such as moving a child to the front row or providing hearing-assistive technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new Canadian study is offering a powerful message to older adults and those who care for them: it's never too late to bounce back. Researchers at the University of Toronto have found that nearly one in four older adults age 60 or older who reported poor well-being at the beginning of a national study—due to pain, health issues, low mood, or isolation—had regained optimal well-being within just three years.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"This isn't just a story of resilience—it's a roadmap for how we can help more &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; recover and thrive," says first author Mabel Ho, a recent doctoral graduate at the University of Toronto's Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work (FIFSW) and the Institute of Life Course and Aging. "Our findings highlight the powerful role of modifiable lifestyle and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychosocial+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychosocial factors&lt;/a&gt; in shaping healthy aging trajectories."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers defined optimal well-being as the absence of severe physical, cognitive, mental, or emotional conditions that interfere with daily functioning, combined with high levels of self-reported &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+well-being/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental well-being&lt;/a&gt;, happiness, and overall &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/life+satisfaction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;life satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study focused exclusively on individuals who were in a state of suboptimal well-being at the outset. Their baseline health status was then compared to their condition after the three-year follow-up period to assess whether they had achieved optimal well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers sought to identify factors associated with the likelihood that these older adults would recover. Remarkably, individuals who reported strong psychological and emotional wellness at the outset were over five times more likely to achieve this very high bar of 'optimal well-being' than those who were struggling with psychological well-being at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Other baseline characteristics significantly associated with recovery included maintaining a healthy body weight, engaging in regular physical activity, avoiding insomnia, refraining from smoking, and participating in social activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's incredibly encouraging to see that, with the right supports and lifestyle, many older adults can reclaim full health, happiness, and independence—even after serious health challenges," says Ho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has important implications: Aging-related policies and programs are needed that prioritize whole-person wellness and acknowledge that recovery is not only possible, but common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Too often, the focus in aging research and geriatric practice is on decline and disability," says senior author Esme Fuller-Thomson, Director of the Institute for Life Course &amp;amp; Aging and Professor at the University of Toronto's Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work. "Our findings disrupt that narrative. Older adults can and do bounce back—and we need to build systems that support recovery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published online this week in &lt;i&gt;PLOS One,&lt;/i&gt; focused on 8,332 respondents who were 60 years or older at the time of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want this study to reshape how society views aging," concluded Ho. "With the right environment, resources, and supports, older adults don't just survive after struggling with health or well-being issues— they thrive."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, titled "Reclaiming Wellness: Key Factors in Restoring Optimal Well-being in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging," drew on longitudinal data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). The research analyzed participants from the baseline wave (2011–2015) and the first follow-up wave (2015–2018) to explore factors linked to successful aging.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UniQure&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QURE" target="_blank"&gt;QURE&lt;/a&gt;) stock catapulted more than 200% Wednesday after the company said its experimental gene therapy successfully treated Huntington's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease is a neurological condition that slowly destroys brain cells, robbing patients of the ability to move and reason. But a high dose of UniQure's AMT-130 slowed disease progression by 75% after three years.&lt;/p&gt;

			
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sarah Tabrizi, director of the University College London Huntington's Disease Center, called the results "groundbreaking."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These data are the most convincing in the field to date and underscore potential disease-modifying effects in Huntington's disease, where an urgent need persists," she said in a statement. "These data indicate that AMT-130 has the potential to meaningfully slow disease progression — offering long-awaited hope to individuals and families impacted by this devastating disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniQure stock launched 247.7% to 47.50. Shares touched a nearly five-year high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Game-Changing' Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniQure said patients who received the gene therapy showed a statistically significant improvement on the composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale, or cUHDRS. The scale was created to assess disease progression in early-to-moderate Huntington's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, patients showed decreased levels of neurofilament light chain in their cerebrospinal fluid after 36 months. Neurofilament light chain, or NfL, is a biomarker that indicates damage to the central nervous system. The gene therapy also continues to be well tolerated, UniQure said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is now planning to file an application for Food and Drug Administration approval in the first quarter of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leerink Partners analyst Joseph Schwartz raised his price target on UniQure stock to 68 from 48 after the company held a call with Huntington's disease experts. He sees the data as "definitive" and the gene therapy as "clearly making a difference on progression."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We think we will rapidly see excitement grow as one of the key leaders in HD described AMT-130 data on the call as 'game-changing,' offering a 'beacon of hope' for patients and their families, and representing a 'significant step toward delivering a licensed disease-modifying therapy for HD,' " he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz now sees an 85% chance AMT-130 wins FDA approval, and a 50% chance European regulators sign off on it.&lt;/p&gt;

But this trial showed magnesium also augments vitamin D synthesis in the gut, the local effects of which may help mitigate risk factors associated with colorectal cancer, even in the absence of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-3" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial investigated the effects of magnesium supplementation on gut microbial data related to the presence of the TRPM7 genotype, which regulates the cellular uptake of both magnesium and calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-4" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted in &lt;i&gt;Medical Xpress&lt;/i&gt;, the results provide a preliminary link between magnesium and reduced risk of colorectal cancer in key populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-5" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gender-based response to magnesium supplementation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers observed that the influence of magnesium supplementation was more pronounced in females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-6" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesized that estrogen could be a central player in shifting magnesium from circulation to cellular uptake, thereby increasing microbial activity in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-7" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In participants with adequate TRPM7 function, there was a significant increase in the levels of beneficial bacteria, including Carnobacterium maltaromaticum and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, known to work together to enhance vitamin D production and mitigate colorectal cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-8" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Consequences of the Colorectal Cancer Prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial consisted of 236 individuals, all of whom had a history of colorectal polyps.

                &lt;p&gt;Meagan Meadows had just started student teaching with a freshly minted master's degree in education when something in her toilet got her attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She almost didn't notice it at first. Meadows, who's 24 and lives in Southern California, said she started to see a little bit of blood after going to the bathroom. It was incredibly faint — barely enough for her to feel scared, but she mentioned it to a couple of friends, and they urged her to get it checked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, she assumed it was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-colon-cancer-misdiagnosed-ibs-hemorrhoid-2025-3?utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;utm_campaign=business-sf&amp;amp;utm_medium=social" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;hemorrhoids&lt;/a&gt;, stress, something wrong with her diet, or all three. A doctor told her it was unlikely to be anything serious because of her age. Initial tests and scans all came back mostly normal, except for a mild iron deficiency and thickening of the intestinal wall that could be caused by dehydration or lack of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, just to be sure, Meadows scheduled a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-had-my-first-colonoscopy-in-my-twenties-2024-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;. She expected a diagnosis like ulcerative colitis and worried that she had overreacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just thought, I'm only 24, there's no way I have anything going on," Meadows told Business Insider. "I felt so embarrassed because clearly I was fine. I almost canceled my appointment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure revealed a walnut-sized tumor in her colon. A biopsy later found it was cancer. Cue a string of follow-up tests, which showed the cancer had spread to the surrounding lymph nodes — a stage 3 diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I woke up, they asked my mom to come in and get me so we could all be in the room with the doctor," she said. "It was difficult to process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meadows said she was shocked at the diagnosis and glad she had advocated for herself and gone through with the colonoscopy, but she wishes it had been sooner. She's since been posting&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;about her experience on TikTok, telling more than 2 million viewers about her diagnosis and the growing number of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;early-onset cases of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;. She hopes she might encourage other young people to get checked, too, even if they think it's probably fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I would have known that so many young people were getting diagnosed with colon cancer, I would have taken the symptom more seriously," Meadows said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="b6edadf2-ad1d-44dd-9561-bea367f6d14c" data-toc-id="b6edadf2-ad1d-44dd-9561-bea367f6d14c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood in stool is a serious symptom, but it's easy to miss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer is notoriously difficult to diagnose because symptoms may not appear until the disease is already in an advanced stage. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-misdiagnosis-young-people-ibs-gluten-allergy-symptoms-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Typical symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, such as abdominal pain or changes to bathroom habits, can be vague and easy to confuse with other conditions like irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/section&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For people under 55 with colon cancer, the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;most common symptom&lt;/a&gt; is rectal bleeding, research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Meadows said the blood in her stool — her only symptom of stage 3 colon cancer — was difficult to see. There was no blood on the toilet paper, and nothing clearly visible in the toilet, as it was mixed into the stool itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It wasn't in concerning amounts; it wasn't there every time. I almost never noticed it there," she said. "I easily wrote it off as something else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had an image in my head that blood in the stool would mean the bowl was just red."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rectal-bleeding-most-common-early-sign-of-colon-cancer-taboo-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Rectal bleeding&lt;/a&gt; can feel difficult or embarrassing to discuss, and patients may be reluctant to mention it even with a healthcare provider, doctors previously told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a pretty vulnerable thing," Meadows said. "Obviously no one wants to talk about their poop, but it's always better to get checked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="754fead0-4ced-40eb-96be-92dda92fc1df" data-toc-id="754fead0-4ced-40eb-96be-92dda92fc1df"&gt;Managing cancer as a young adult — and a ton of unexpected costs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meadows said she was lucky to have health insurance through her parents to cover the costs of treatment, including surgery and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                      Meadows at the hospital with her family during treatment. Her parents' insurance covered most of the costs, but she had to pay for fertility preservation out-of-pocket with the help of a GoFundMe.

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since chemo and surgery can affect fertility later in life, Meadows had to quickly decide prior to treatment whether she might ever want to have children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wanted the option, which meant undergoing expensive fertility preservation treatment. The out-of-pocket cost was about $10,000, including the egg retrieval procedure and required medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The whole thing is so surreal. I went from being a normal 24-year-old to now having to plan for something I wasn't even considering for years," she said. "I didn't expect I'd have to try to protect that at this age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her friends started a GoFundMe to help offset the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Meadows had been substitute teaching —&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an unpaid role — she's had to postpone her career. Her weakened immune system from chemotherapy makes it risky to be at school, where germs can run rampant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in the middle of rounds of chemo, Meadows said she's coping with the help of her family, friends, and boyfriend. She also adopted a puppy, a cocker spaniel mix named Hughes, from a local shelter, for emotional support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I didn't have him, there would be days I didn't leave the house," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meadows said that to manage the hourslong chemo sessions and the time resting afterward, she has a long list of books to read and hopes to learn new hobbies such as crocheting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chemo definitely takes a toll on you, mentally and physically. And it's hard knowing that there's not a 100% chance that won't come back," she said. "I'm just taking it one day at a time and trying to enjoy what I can."&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;SANTA FE, N.M. — The New Mexico Department of Health reported Wednesday a case of plague in a 77-year-old man from Bernalillo County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to NMDOH, the man spent time in the hospital but doctors discharged him. He is the second reported plague case this year. There have been no deaths from plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague is a bacterial disease of rodents, generally transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas. Direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife and pets can also transmit it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The bacterium that causes plague can be found in wild rodents and their fleas throughout New Mexico,” said Dr. Erin Phipps, state public health veterinarian for NMDOH. “Keeping pets on the flea control product recommended by your veterinarian helps protect them and your family.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To prevent plague, NMDOH recommends: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits and their nests and burrows. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean up areas near your home where rodents live, such as woodpiles, brush and junk piles and abandoned vehicles.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put hay, wood and compost piles as far as possible from your home.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use insect repellent while hiking, camping, or working outdoors. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talk to your veterinarian about safe flea control products for your pets. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have sick pets examined promptly by a veterinarian. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See your doctor about any unexplained illness you may have involving sudden and severe fever.   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of plague in humans include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sudden onset of fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is often a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit or neck areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cats and dogs can experience fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. You may notice swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NMDOH encourages you to get diagnosed, start treatment and then report any diagnosis to them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release came a day after the Illinois Department of Public Health Immunization Advisory Committee &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/09/22/illinois-committee-covid-19-vaccines/"&gt;voted unanimously&lt;/a&gt; to recommend updated COVID-19 vaccines for all Illinois residents ages 18 and older. That committee also voted to recommend the shots for all children ages 6 to 23 months old and for children between the ages of 2 and 17 if they are in higher risk groups, or if their parents want them to have the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state followed the committee’s votes in making its own recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At a time when the federal government is abdicating its responsibility to provide clear, science-informed guidance, Illinois is stepping up,” said Gov. JB Pritzker, in a news release. “Illinois will continue to empower providers and families across our state with the information and access they need to guard against illness and disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Department of Public Health also issued a “&lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/idph/resources/topics-services/prevention-wellness/immunization/2025-26-covid19-vaccination-standing-order.pdf"&gt;standing order&lt;/a&gt;” allowing health care providers and pharmacists across the state to administer the shots in line with the state’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal insurance and state-regulated health insurance plans must cover the vaccine. Most of the largest private health insurers in the country have also said they plan to continue covering the vaccines at no cost to patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois is one of a number of states that have gone their own way on COVID-19 vaccines this year after U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired and replaced all the members of a federal vaccine advisory committee. Changes at the federal level have led to&lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/08/10/covid-19-vaccines-illinois/"&gt; confusion in recent months&lt;/a&gt; over who might be able to get updated COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That federal committee decided last week to no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines and instead leave it up to individuals whether to get the shots.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“Democrat-run states that pushed unscientific school lockdowns, toddler mask mandates, and draconian vaccine passports during the COVID era completely eroded the American people’s trust in public health agencies,” said U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon in a statement Tuesday. “(The federal advisory committee) remains the scientific body guiding immunization recommendations in this country, and HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to recommending COVID-19 vaccines, the Illinois Department of Public Health on Tuesday also recommended flu vaccines for all people ages 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department recommended RSV vaccines for all pregnant people during weeks 32 through 36 of pregnancy; infants less than 8 months old whose mothers didn’t get the vaccine; children ages 8 months through 19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV; adults ages 50 through 74 who are at increased risk of severe RSV; and all adults ages 75 years and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, usually causes mild, coldlike symptoms and most people recover in a week or two. Babies and older adults, however, are more likely to develop severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;The state health department is also recommending for routine, nonseasonal vaccines that Illinois residents continue to follow CDC immunization schedules for children and adults issued as of Aug. 7, 2025, before the most recent meeting of the federal vaccine advisory committee.&lt;/p&gt;
