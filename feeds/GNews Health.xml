The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) enforced the same guidance in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;There was a 50% relative increase in colorectal cancer diagnoses in people aged 45 to 49 from 2021 to 2022, researchers found.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), the researchers analyzed &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CRC diagnoses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CRC diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; from 2004 to 2022 among adults aged 20 to 54, sorted by age, location and stage at diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/western-diet-blamed-growing-risk-gi-cancers-among-young-adults" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:'Western Diet' Blamed For Growing Risk Of Gi Cancers Among Young Adults;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Western Diet' Blamed For Growing Risk Of Gi Cancers Among Young Adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnoses have increased by 1.6% each year since 2004 in the 20 to 39 age group, and by more than 2% annually since 2012 in those aged 40 to 44 and 50 to 54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 1.1% annual increase in people 45 to 49 years old accelerated to 12% per year from 2019 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Individuals in their late 40s had a 19% increase in local-stage colon cancer detection each year from 2019 to 2022.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACS confirmed the increase was driven by the detection of local-stage tumors, which increased by nearly 19% each year for colon cancer and more than 25% for rectal cancer in that timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before this period, colon cancer detection rates had been stable, and rectal cancer detection rates had been declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/rare-cancer-diagnoses-surge-dramatically-among-millennials-gen-x" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rare Cancer Diagnoses Surge Dramatically Among Millennials And Gen X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rare Cancer Diagnoses Surge Dramatically Among Millennials And Gen X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced-stage disease also continues to steeply increase, ACS reported, rising from 1.7% to 2.9% annually since 2004 among adults under 45 and "even more rapidly" in the past 10 years in those aged 45 to 54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings led to another ACS study, also published in JAMA, which found that CRC screening among U.S. adults between 45 and 49 increased by 62% from 2019 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists analyzed the data of more than 50,000 individuals to compare changes in screening. They found that CRC screening, which was at 20% in 2021, jumped to 37% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 45- to 49-year-olds, colonoscopy screening increased by 43%, and stool-based testing increased more than five times from 2019 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Jessica Star, associate scientist at ACS in Atlanta, considers it "thrilling" to see this increase in screening among younger individuals, as it's likely linked to earlier-stage diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, we still have a long way to go," she said in the release. "Screening for colorectal cancer in ages 45 to 49 remains suboptimal, and has not increased equitably by both educational attainment and insurance status."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The study findings support efforts for everyone in the 45 to 49 age group to have access to screening.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul E. Oberstein, M.D., medical oncologist and assistant director of the Pancreatic Cancer Center at NYU Langone Perlmutter Cancer Center, said the increase in screening is "successful in detecting more cancers at an early stage where the chance of cure is very high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This ultimately should mean that fewer people are diagnosed later in life and fewer people have advanced colon cancer," Oberstein, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study reinforces the need to focus research on understanding the causes of colon cancer increases – and possible steps to reduce these cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Individuals of all ages should contact a doctor if colorectal cancer symptoms arise, an oncologist said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of colon cancer in those under 45 remains "substantially lower," he noted, "so it is not clear yet if universal screening at a younger age is beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some specific patients who are younger than 45 may benefit from earlier screening, however, such as those with a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/genetics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:family history;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;family history&lt;/a&gt; or personal risk factors, the oncologist added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/exercise-program-reduces-common-cancer-recurrence-boosts-survival" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Exercise Program Reduces Common Cancer Recurrence And Boosts Survival;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Program Reduces Common Cancer Recurrence And Boosts Survival&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As colon cancer continues to increase in younger individuals, Oberstein recommends contacting a doctor if any concerning symptoms are noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Craig Eagle, chief medical officer of Guardant Health in California, added that early detection is "crucial," noting that the five-year survival rate for CRC is over 90% when the disease is caught in early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[This] plummets to 13% in late stages when symptoms usually appear," Eagle, who also was not involved in the research, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rise in diagnoses for those in their 40s is an alarming reminder that screening must be easier and more accessible to reach the 50 million Americans who remain unscreened."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/colorectal-cancer-diagnoses-soar-among-younger-adults-one-key-reason" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Colorectal cancer diagnoses soar among younger adults for one key reason;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Colorectal cancer diagnoses soar among younger adults for one key reason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 12:22:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE95emU2TUQ5NWd3MDRmYkpVV0NvM2ZmNjFtUHZ5STR5YVZ1VHh3a0YtTERZVWpJZllDM2V2WktoVm92Nk9yYnE3SEJiODJ3UkxOeHdwa0RPU0gwZUFicVltS2RfSVpOTF8zc1d3ZnkxSkVXRW12Tll2YUV3ODZlZw</guid></item><item><title>帕金森与肠道细菌的联系暗示了一种意想不到的简单治疗方法- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxOOHZaWFBfcGdQbHl1ZWhPUl85OEFySU5Xb2dNMHh6MFFsbl9nVVpKNHVYZnR6TGkzOElHUHlOcWVTc1hMa210Z3VmcS14VzE5SV9Iakw2aF9qZEo5R3R4QlB5YWd4S0RDUko3dFc0WVBCbnU0V2YwbjBKZ2pEbXBSNDQ4a2lBbzM4a19KUHcyeUh1azhrek9QTi1FNms5cHE0X1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We may have new hope in the battle against  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170622" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease. Researchers have found that lithium levels in the brain are closely linked to the condition, and that lithium supplements can reverse Alzheimer's-like memory loss in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from Harvard Medical School, the researchers wanted to investigate &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-200282"&gt;previous links&lt;/a&gt; that have been made between exposure to metals and dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through hundreds of donated brain tissue and blood samples taken from people with advanced Alzheimer's, early-stage &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mild_cognitive_impairment"&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; (MCI), and no cognitive issues at all, the team ran tests for dozens of different metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-distinct-patterns-may-signal-alzheimers-according-to-science"&gt;These 4 Distinct Patterns May Signal Alzheimer's According to Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one metal showed significant differences in abundance between these groups: lithium. Reduced levels of this metal were also noticeable at the earliest stages of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-name-new-type-of-memory-loss-often-mistaken-for-alzheimers"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt; in the tested samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea that lithium deficiency could be a cause of Alzheimer's disease is new and suggests a different therapeutic approach," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/could-lithium-explain-and-treat-alzheimers/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist and neurologist Bruce Yankner, from Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lithium is widely used to treat &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-where-extreme-moods-of-bipolar-disorder-exist-in-brain"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;, this is the first time it's been found to be naturally present in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lithium turns out to be like other nutrients we get from the environment, such as iron and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="170622" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; C," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/could-lithium-explain-and-treat-alzheimers/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Yankner. "It's the first time anyone's shown that lithium exists at a natural level that's biologically meaningful without giving it as a drug."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170625" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170625" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/LithiumDeficiency.jpg" alt="Lithium deficiency images" class="wp-image-170625 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/LithiumDeficiency.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/LithiumDeficiency-600x307.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170625" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, lithium deficiency (the two right panels) dramatically increased amyloid beta (top) and tau (bottom) proteins, compared to mice with normal lithium levels (left two panels). (Yankner Lab)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed that the amyloid-beta protein clumps &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/3d-molecular-structure-of-alzheimers-brains-revealed-for-the-first-time"&gt;that accompany Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be binding to lithium in the brain, making less of it available to neurons and further accelerating the progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers ran tests on mice, finding that depriving their brains of lithium dramatically increased the clumps of amyloid-beta in their brains. The amount of another Alzheimer's-related protein &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sky-high-levels-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-newborns"&gt;called tau&lt;/a&gt; also increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better, the researchers found that a certain type of lithium, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_orotate"&gt;lithium orotate&lt;/a&gt;, could evade capture by amyloid-beta proteins. When small doses of it were given to mice with Alzheimer's-like symptoms, the animals' memory function was restored, and other signs of cognitive decline were effectively reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still plenty of questions left unanswered, as is often the case with Alzheimer's, which is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-disease-harms-the-brain-in-2-distinct-phases-study-reveals"&gt;an incredibly complex disease&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment, it's not clear how levels of lithium begin to drop, for example, and how that then leads to signs of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies should help to clarify that, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="170622" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are the next significant step. Eventually, Alzheimer's could be diagnosed earlier by measuring patients' lithium levels, while lithium supplements could be a useful preventative or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the number of people with dementia &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-can-strike-as-young-as-30-these-are-the-signs-to-watch-for"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, there's an urgent need to find ways of protecting the brain against the devastating consequences of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to be careful about extrapolating from mouse models, and you never know until you try it in a controlled human &lt;span&gt;clinical trial&lt;/span&gt;, but so far the results are very encouraging," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/could-lithium-explain-and-treat-alzheimers/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Yankner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09335-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Over the past two centuries, vaccines have been critical for preventing infectious diseases.

In a statistically sophisticated analysis of health records, the team found that the vaccine reduced the probability of getting dementia by one-fifth over a seven-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that people who received the shingles vaccine were less likely to develop clinical dementia over the seven-year follow-up period, and women benefited more than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study design allowed researchers to compare two groups without actively depriving any one group of access to vaccination. The two groups were also of comparable age and had similar medical comorbidities – meaning similar rates of other medical conditions such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results from this and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-221231"&gt;other related studies&lt;/a&gt; raise the possibility that vaccines may have a broader role in experimental therapeutics outside the realm of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies also raise provocative questions about how vaccines work and how our immune system can potentially prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How vaccines might be protective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One scientific explanation for the reduction of dementia by the herpes zoster vaccine could be the direct protection against the shingles virus, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-230718"&gt;may play a role in exacerbating dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is also the possibility that the vaccine may have conferred protection by activating the immune system and providing "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6"&gt;trained immunity&lt;/a&gt;," in which the immune system is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20221388"&gt;strengthened by repeated exposure&lt;/a&gt; to vaccines or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did not differentiate between different types of dementia, such as dementia due to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease or dementia due to stroke. Additionally, researchers cannot draw any definitive conclusions about possible mechanisms for how the vaccines could be protective from an analysis of health records alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step would be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study – the "gold standard" for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in medicine – to directly examine how the herpes zoster vaccine compares with a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; in their ability to reduce the risk of dementia over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such studies are necessary before any vaccines, as well as other potential therapies, can be recommended for routine clinical use in the prevention of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The challenges of untangling dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a major noncommunicable disease that is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-024-01051-w"&gt;a leading cause of death around the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A January 2025 study provided &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03340-9"&gt;updated figures on lifetime dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; across different subsets of the US population. The researchers estimate that the lifetime risk of dementia after age 55 is 42% – more than double earlier estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dementia risk was 4% by age 75, and 20% by age 85, with the majority of risk occurring after 85. The researchers projected that the number of new cases of dementia in the US would double over the next four decades from approximately 514,000 cases in 2020 to 1 million in 2060.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170679" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170679" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/patient_with_alzheimers_642.jpg" alt="elderly man looking at a book with a partner" class="wp-image-170679 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/patient_with_alzheimers_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/patient_with_alzheimers_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/patient_with_alzheimers_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170679" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cases of dementia could reach 1 million by 2060. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAD5TsR1koQ/"&gt;Robert Kneschke/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once considered a disease largely confined to the developed world, the deleterious effects of dementia are now apparent throughout the globe, as life expectancy increases in many formerly developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are different forms of dementia with varying clinical manifestations and underlying neurobiology, &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prospective studies that specifically test how giving a vaccine changes the risk for future dementia may benefit from studying patient populations with specific types of dementia because each version of dementia might require distinct treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, for the past two to three decades, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1566067"&gt;amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; – which posits that accumulation of a protein called amyloid in the brain contributes to the disorder – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2023.102161"&gt;dominated the scientific conversation&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, most of the efforts in the experimental therapeutics of Alzheimer's disease have focused on drugs that lower the levels of amyloid in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, results to date have been &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02480-1/fulltext"&gt;modest and disappointing&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(23)00274-0/fulltext"&gt;two recently approved amyloid-lowering therapies&lt;/a&gt; have only a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.19080873"&gt;minimal impact on slowing the decline&lt;/a&gt;, are expensive and have potentially serious side effects. And no drug currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for clinical use reverses the cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies based on health records suggest that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2022.12.029"&gt;past exposure to viruses increase the risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, while routine vaccines, including those against tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pneumonia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73057" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, shingles and others, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-221231"&gt;reduce the risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Innovation and an open mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is sometimes a tendency among scientists to cling to older, familiar models of disease and a reluctance to move in more unconventional directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the process of doing science has a way of teaching researchers like us humility, opening our minds to new information, learning from our mistakes and going where that data takes us in our quest for effective, life-saving therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines may be one of those paths less traveled. It is an exciting possibility that may open the door to other breakthroughs in understanding and treating degenerative disorders of the brain.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257807/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is a high risk of developing microbial keratitis, otherwise known as a corneal ulcer, that can lead to permanent blindness and in some cases corneal transplant,” she noted. “Instead, always rinse and store in contact lens solution, replace your case regularly, and replace lenses as directed by your eye care provider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to storing and lubricating your contact lenses improperly, using the same pair for longer than recommended can lead to eye health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I never forget to discard my contact lenses in the prescribed time period,” McLaughlin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t eat an unbalanced diet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eating a diet high in sugar and fat may go without saying as being bad for one’s health, but it also has a disproportionately negative effect on the eyes,” Deobhakta said. “Certain diseases like diabetes are responsible for the most common forms of irreversible blindness that we see in our clinics, and that is often linked to eating an unbalanced diet high in carbohydrates and fat.” &lt;/p&gt;

After a Legionnaires' outbreak that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5652421/#:~:text=During%20the%20summer%20of%202015,tower%20in%20the%20South%20Bronx." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sickened 138 people and killed 16&lt;/a&gt; a decade ago, &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/ll77of2015.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;city law&lt;/a&gt; requires building owners to test for Legionella bacteria every three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d223h"&gt;In 2017, the first year of inspections, the agency inspected 5,200 cooling towers and issued over 48,000 violations to building owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dt9t6"&gt;This year, the department is on track to complete less than half that number of inspections – just 1,167 as of June, according to data provided by the health department. It’s a record low, not counting 2020 and 2021, when the pandemic disrupted city services. And the number of violations this year is set to hit an all-time low. As of April, the department only issued 269.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5v2q3"&gt;The data also shows year after year of declining enforcement. After rebounding to 4,400 inspections in 2022, the agency has conducted between 22% and 30% fewer inspections and issued fewer violations each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dhuqh"&gt;Chantal Gomez, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the decrease in inspections was due to a lack of inspectors at the agency. She did not respond to questions about the severity of the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a7q6o"&gt;The current outbreak that started in late July has sickened 73 people, three of them fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="50ov4"&gt;The 2017 laws require building owners to register cooling towers and inspect for Legionella bacteria. The law, however, does not indicate how often the city must carry out its own inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6agon"&gt;Cooling tower inspections, according to city experts, are a critical defense against outbreaks of the deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8qu05"&gt;Acting Health Commissioner Michelle Morse told WNYC on Wednesday that the ability to inspect cooling towers after the outbreak helped the city stop the disease's spread in Harlem. However, she did not elaborate on whether more regular inspections could have prevented the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d6ai0"&gt;“From my perspective, there is of course always more that we can do to advance our prevention efforts, and this is why investing in public health is so important,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6iafe"&gt;A review of cooling tower registration and inspection data shows that about 1,900 of the 4,928 registered towers in the city have not been inspected by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene since 2023 and 85 have no record of inspection by the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cjkk2"&gt;Those towers cool apartments and other large buildings by circulating water through air conditioning systems. The water returns to the cooling tower warm and is evaporated as vapor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="55aas"&gt;Without proper inspection and treatment, that warm water can become a hotbed for deadly Legionella bacteria. Inhaling infected vapor can lead to Legionnaires’ disease, which causes cough, fever, chills, muscle aches and difficulty breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 22:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNOXZZU2taekFwaEtuQkZCZ2d1SDZJWHFoLXdFNFI4eHA2am9kOHlBbVRtQXZkWFdWbkhIOWVmODd4cTNZNU4xVHJUcE5TWHVoTVYtYUlRRmZ3akxEdjJ5RFJicjFURzVpNFZkMmNnb29tTEhOMUttaXc5RnlpVkFKb1lJcVlyclZqQkdETzRpVmJRaUxZckFnaXRFR1EzUQ</guid></item><item><title>在Martha's Vineyard感染罕见蜱传病毒的婴儿- Boston.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="content-well content-well--article" role="main"&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A 1-month-old infant on Martha’s Vineyard contracted a rare but serious tick-borne disease, her family and local health officials said, as &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/07/09/northeast-sees-worst-summer-surge-in-tick-bites-in-years-cdc-says/"&gt;tick-borne diseases&lt;/a&gt; are on the rise across the state this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powassan virus was detected in a resident of &lt;a href="http://Boston.com/tag/marthas-vineyard"&gt;Martha’s Vineyard&lt;/a&gt;, local public health officials said Monday. The virus is transmitted by deer ticks within 15 minutes of a bite, and there is no specific treatment, vaccine, or cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local public health announcement comes during one of the &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/07/09/northeast-sees-worst-summer-surge-in-tick-bites-in-years-cdc-says/"&gt;largest surges&lt;/a&gt; in tick bites in the last five years. In Massachusetts, most of the tick exposure was concentrated in the Berkshires and on Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/lists/monthly-tick-borne-disease-reports#2025-"&gt;the state’s May 2025 report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While rare, the rate of Powassan virus is increasing, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/about/index.html"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, and can cause severe disease, including inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, as well as brain swelling, confusion, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking, and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1 and 2 percent of nymph deer tickets on Martha’s Vineyard are infected, said Sam Telford, a Tufts University professor who researches on the island. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The virus is present every year in a small percentage of deer ticks; fortunately, severe disease remains very rare,” Telford said in a &lt;a href="https://www.capecod.gov/2025/08/05/press-release-rare-but-serious-tick-borne-virus-investigated-on-marthas-vineyard/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a similar rate to that seen elsewhere in New England. This suggests that many people who are exposed may successfully fight off the virus without ever knowing they were infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1-month-old Lily, born on June 30, was on a walk with her mom and her older sister on a West Tisbury bike path near her home, her family told the &lt;a href="https://vineyardgazette.com/news/2025/08/05/west-tisbury-infant-contracts-powassan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vineyard Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The infant was first taken to the hospital with a high fever, and doctors eventually determined the source was the tick bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suffered brain damage, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-lily-siscos-health-journey?lang=en_US&amp;amp;utm_campaign=man_ss_icons&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link&amp;amp;attribution_id=sl%3Aed5b139f-5cd0-4ba3-8249-d52adf974399&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawL_K8pleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFXWGJTOXp2M2FTZGdIYnBXAR7a61BX1DlBiy46pvum9XsqoVWf_JDlIUd_J-q-xDYIQgrR3u5M1VozBphn_g_aem_zxBXvhKa8vqN8tK30hctcQ"&gt;GoFundMe created for the family&lt;/a&gt;, due to meningitis and encephalitis from the Powassan, which was unknown at the time, an update last week said. The baby was receiving care at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Please, please check yourselves, your children and your pets,” Tiffany Sisco said, according to the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. “It was the tiniest nymph tick the size of a needle tip. No rash or bullseye was detected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sisco was sharing updates on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/tiffany.lynn.9003/posts/pfbid02DVzwZi1GMzS2pVsTprpTozSGWeZzCzgNTsbMfg6bCALdKFmYw46SM1VSmCmujZyTl"&gt;her Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;, where she said Thursday morning that Lily was stable “and awaiting further tests” in her final public update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(We) hope to bring her home soon,” Sisco wrote. “Continued prayers as we navigate our new normal.”&lt;/p&gt;

However, a 2023 study published in the journal &lt;em data-node-id="0.3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/study-confirms-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-faster-in-women-than-men/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/study-confirms-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-faster-in-women-than-men/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gastroenterology" data-node-id="0.3.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Gastroenterology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a42860161/study-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-in-young-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a42860161/study-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-in-young-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="rates of pancreatic cancer are rising faster in women" data-node-id="0.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;rates of pancreatic cancer are rising faster in women&lt;/a&gt;, especially in women of color, than they are in men. &lt;em data-node-id="0.7"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This fact, plus the aggressive nature of the illness, are why knowing the symptoms of pancreatic cancer is so important. “It has a high likelihood of spread, or metastasis, to other organs in the body,” said &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Neil Woody, M.D." data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Neil Woody, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic. What's more, the five-year survival rate is only 9%, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Cancer Society" data-node-id="1.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Why is the disease on the rise? Part of it is due to increased detection, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Valerie Lee, M.D." data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Valerie Lee, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a medical oncologist at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Sibley Memorial Hospital. Lifestyle factors may be playing a role as well. Increases in diabetes and obesity—two major risk factors for pancreatic cancer—may also be contributing to the rise in pancreatic cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="body-tip css-1707dxl emevuu60"&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Neil Woody, M.D." data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Neil Woody, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic; &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Valerie Lee, M.D." data-node-id="4.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Valerie Lee, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a medical oncologist at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Sibley Memorial Hospital; &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kim Reiss, M.D." data-node-id="4.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Kim Reiss, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an oncologist specializing in pancreatic cancer at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-pancreatic-cancer-is-tough-to-diagnose" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Why pancreatic cancer is tough to diagnose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Pancreatic cancer is notoriously difficult to diagnose. Only about 10% of pancreatic cancers have a genetic predisposition, and good screenings for the general population have been difficult to establish, said Dr. Woody. “Tests with high likelihood of detecting pancreatic cancer, such as endoscopic ultrasound, are invasive, costly, and may carry risks of complications that outweigh their use as screening tests for the average person,” he explained.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;What’s more, many of the symptoms of pancreatic cancer can be caused by other conditions. Plus, people have almost no symptoms at all until the cancer has spread to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, if you are experiencing any of these warning signs, it’s worth making an appointment with your doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="9" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;1. You have no major risk factors for diabetes but suddenly have it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The pancreas produces insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. So if blood sugar levels suddenly chance, the pancreas becomes the number one suspect. “When people with no risk factors for &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="diabetes" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; (no family history, good diet, thin body type) develop new onset diabetes, or who have a history of well controlled diabetes suddenly find that it becomes difficult to control, it’s reasonable to evaluate why the pancreas may not be functioning as well,” said Dr. Lee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="11" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;2. You experience abdominal pain that feels like you're being squeezed around the middle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“The pancreas sits close to a bundle of blood vessels and nerves called the celiac plexus that can cause pain and nerve irritation,” said Dr. Lee. When it happens, the pain is usually pretty encompassing of your abdomen.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Patients feel pain from the epigastrum (the area just under the sternum) through to their back. Imagine a tire hiked up right under your chest and around your abdomen,” said &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kim Reiss, M.D." data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Kim Reiss, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an oncologist specializing in pancreatic cancer at the University of Pennsylvania.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="14" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;3. You develop an unexplained blood clot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Patients with pancreas cancer are particularly prone to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20489603/6-signs-you-might-have-a-blood-clot/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20489603/6-signs-you-might-have-a-blood-clot/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="blood clots" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;blood clots&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Lee.   While the exact cause is not known, it is believed that cancer cells reduce production of the proteins the body uses to prevent blood clots.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“For people who do not have a reason for the development of a clot—a recent major surgery, trauma (like a car accident), hospitalization, or prolonged period where you are laying still, or a hereditary predisposition to clotting—we recommend making sure you are up to date on your cancer screening and to check in with your doctor about any other symptoms that may help to identify the source of the clotting abnormality,” said Dr. Lee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="17" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;4. Your stool starts to float&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“The pancreas does not just produce insulin; it also produces pancreatic enzymes that help break down fat,” said Dr. Lee. “If there is a blockage in the output of pancreatic enzymes, such as a tumor developing in the pancreas, then fat is not digested as well.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This comes out as foul-smelling “fatty” stools that float to the top of the toilet bowl, and may come many times per day shortly after eating fattier meals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-whites-of-your-eyes-st" data-node-id="20" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;5. The whites of your eyes start to look yellow&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The pancreas is located close to the liver, which produces bile. If a tumor prevents the bile ducts from draining bile appropriately, people may develop elevated levels of bilirubin in their body, which translates into jaundice, or a yellowing of the skin. “This is usually best seen in the white of the eyes, and can also lead to itching all over the body, light colored stools, and darkened urine,” said Dr. Lee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="22" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;6. You have very little appetite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you experience a loss of appetite or feel full after eating very little, this also may be a sign of pancreatic cancer. “The pancreas is nestled right near the first part of the small intestine, and tumors can cause food to back up or not get through to the small intestine as quickly,” said Dr. Reiss.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 20:43:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQSldoWkNWNWR6NjJwX2EzaGpwSWgtTkUzc1I0QzdFZGhmaWx6ZXU5Y1VtaHRRZXZQS3JZVUtLYTMtZGlFSXFkMlJYVjg5UWpfMVB1eThfUE85cG9vREJVVmlLS25sUjRrZzdDbFJlNTRhbjZVRV9Cb2lfc1V5ODRGbVh5UjhsSVFRQnVWWWF5QXpHTndrYnVz</guid></item><item><title>吃意大利面让你更快乐，我们有证据- Chowhound</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE5aUkFuNGZxcEtoM3A5Z3ljUHdCMnNybFI0Y2dWYllFVnRfZVAxUzFQODNDNXladWIxckdIVUFTXy1GaE1iRElBQTFseTVaWWhDdXZ0ZklSNnhLaEQ3el9XTExsMmcyZXd5QVZJNnVuWnU3SGtuTllrUjJUZWlodw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="content" class="article"&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a true pasta lover, then you probably understand the struggle. Whether a classic Italian spaghetti Bolognese coated in a delicious, slow-cooked meaty ragù and finished with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese, a &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/1757604/aglio-e-olio-simple-sauce/" target="_blank"&gt;three-ingredient aglio e olio for those nights you just don't want to cook at all&lt;/a&gt;, or a simple yet mouthwatering penne marinara, simmered in fresh tomatoes and topped with several basil leaves — the choices are endless. Unfortunately though, so are the carbs as well as the gluten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to gluten, there are plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/1693410/gluten-free-pasta-brands-ranked-best-worst/" target="_blank"&gt;gluten-free pasta brands&lt;/a&gt; to choose from. However, that doesn't change the fact that a single serving of your favorite spaghetti carbonara packs over 900 calories. Still, there are very few reasons to completely cut pasta out of your diet, unless you develop an allergy or a medical condition like Celiac disease. For those who can digest gluten, experts suggest that eating it two to three times a week is more than enough. If you're feeling guilty for going over that limit this week, here's something that will surely brighten your day: According to science, pasta actually makes you happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Italian scientists who conducted this research (of course). As a matter of fact, in 2023, the team at the &lt;a href="https://internationalpasta.org/news/pasta-makes-you-happy/" target="_blank"&gt;Behavioral and Brain Lab at Milan's Free University of Languages and Communication (IULM)&lt;/a&gt; used techniques to measure people's brain activity and closely watched participants' behavior. These techniques are close to those one would use for a lie detector test. They actually evaluated the facial reactions, brain activity, heart rate shifts, and micro perspiration of 40 people aged between 25 and 55. Oh, and needless to say, this was all happening as they were consuming pasta. So, what did the results show?&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists at IULM were surprised to discover that eating just a single plate of pasta triggered the same kind of positive emotional-cognitive response in the participants as listening to a song played by their favorite band, watching the Olympics, or watching their favorite tennis player land a match-winning shot at Wimbledon. While the team linked this emotional boost to the way pasta, a beloved comfort food, activates memories and feelings of comfort and pleasure, it's now the only study to reveal a link between pasta and happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating a bowl of your favorite pasta dish (and therefore carbs) anywhere — at home or any of the &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/1693690/best-italian-restaurants-nyc/" target="_blank"&gt;20 best Italian restaurants in New York City&lt;/a&gt; — releases endorphins, hormones that increase feelings of joy, while reducing stress and anxiety. What's more, pasta is considered a complex carbohydrate. Unlike simple carbs, complex ones are made up of longer chains of sugar molecules, which provide a steadier stream of energy and boost serotonin levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because complex carbohydrates support the production of tryptophan, an amino acid and precursor to the so-called feel-good hormone, which plays a great role in mood regulation. And finally, pasta keeps up to 80% of its B-vitamins even after cooking, which, in turn, are essential for converting tryptophan into serotonin. So next time you're feeling a bit down, don't be too hard on yourself, just get that pasta boiling. Then whip up your favorite sauce, mix it all together, and dig right in.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

	Erica Kahn was on vacation in Arizona with her father last year when a wild bat flew into her open mouth.&lt;em&gt; GoFundMe&lt;/em&gt;	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

					
				&lt;/header&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A Massachusetts woman was left on the hook for thousands of dollars in medical bills after a &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/01/06/new-hampshire-elementary-school-closed-after-hundreds-of-hibernating-bats-found-in-building/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; flew into her open mouth during a stargazing trip to Arizona last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erica Kahn and her father were snapping long-exposure photos of the nighttime landscape at Horseshoe Bend when a wild bat managed to wedge itself between Kahn’s camera and her face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As I was screaming, part of the bat unfortunately went in my mouth (fun fact, they taste earthy and a little sweet!),” Kahn recalled on a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-erica-kahn-with-medical-bills-after-rabies-exposure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; to help cover her subsequent medical bills. She said her father, a doctor, recommended she go to an emergency room to receive &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/clinical-care/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;post-exposure prophylaxis&lt;/a&gt; for rabies due to the close contact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was a catch: The 33-year-old biomedical engineer was temporarily uninsured, having opted to forgo health insurance after she was laid off last summer. Kahn found an insurance policy online the day after the bat incident and signed up, figuring she’d be covered when she went to the hospital, according to &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/tourist-rabies-treatment-wild-bat-in-mouth-surprise-bill-of-the-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Kahn’s chosen insurer had a 30-day waiting period for benefits to kick in, the news outlet reported. Four hospital visits and seven shots later, Kahn’s medical bills totaled $20,749.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought it must have been a mistake,” she told KFF. “I guess I was naive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., bats are the most-reported animals with rabies, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/bats.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the CDC reports that most people who die of rabies in the U.S. have been exposed to a rabid bat. The agency also notes that bat bites can be tiny, and anyone who gets bat saliva or brain matter in their eyes, nose, mouth, or open wounds should seek urgent medical care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/09/1091797594/the-capitol-fox-fascinated-folks-but-no-one-mentioned-the-cost-of-rabies-treatme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; reports, post-exposure treatment — which usually involves several doses of the rabies vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin — can cost thousands of dollars even before hospital fees kick in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now employed again and working to negotiate and pay down her medical bills, Kahn is turning to GoFundMe for help covering some of the costs. With a fundraising goal of $12,000, she’s also vowed to donate half of the proceeds to UNICEF to support health care for families in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she acknowledged her mistake in declining to stay on her former employer’s insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), Kahn said the cost of her medical care was “pretty extreme.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wish our health care system wasn’t so broken in the United States,” she added on her fundraising page. “I believe life-saving medical care is a fundamental human right and it’s depressing that Americans can only turn to GoFundMe instead of a federally protected safety net.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Kahn was adamant she harbors no ill will toward bats. She’s also tried to keep a sense of humor about the ordeal, medical bills notwithstanding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As Michael Scott &lt;a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/156289049543354268/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said in The Office&lt;/a&gt;, ‘myth: three Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: *four* Americans every year die from rabies,’” Kahn joked on her GoFundMe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bromide sedatives vanished from the US market by 1989, after the Food and Drug Administration banned them, and "bromism" as a syndrome is today unfamiliar to many Americans. (Though you can still get it by &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/15563659709001219"&gt;drinking, as one poor guy did, two to four liters of cola daily [!],&lt;/a&gt; if that cola contains "brominated vegetable oil." Fortunately, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/hfp-constituent-updates/fda-revokes-regulation-allowing-use-brominated-vegetable-oil-bvo-food"&gt;removed brominated vegetable oil&lt;/a&gt; from US food products in 2024.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, over the man's first day at the hospital, he grew worse and showed "increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations." He then attempted to escape the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the escape attempt, the man was given an involuntary psychiatric hold and an anti-psychosis drug. He was administered large amounts of fluids and electrolytes, as the best way to beat bromism is "aggressive saline diuresis"—that is, to load someone up with liquids and let them pee out all the bromide in their system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This took time, as the man's bromide level was eventually measured at a whopping 1,700 mg/L, while the "reference range" for healthy people is 0.9 to 7.3 mg/L.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the man suffered from a terrifying psychosis and was kept in the hospital for &lt;em&gt;three full weeks&lt;/em&gt; over an entirely preventable condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it all began&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during his stay, once doctors had his psychosis under control, that the man began telling them how it all began. He had read about the problems with too much table salt, which led him to rid his diet of sodium chloride, which led him to ChatGPT, which led him to believe that he could use sodium bromide instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors who &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260"&gt;wrote up this case study for Annals of Internal Medicine: Clinical Cases&lt;/a&gt; note that they never got access to the man's actual ChatGPT logs. He likely used ChatGPT 3.5 or 4.0, they say, but it's not clear that the man was actually told by the chatbot to do what he did. Bromide salts &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be substituted for table salt—just not in the human body. They are used in various cleaning products and pool treatments, however.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A greasy takeaway may seem like an innocent Friday night indulgence. But our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S3050624725000051"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; suggests even a single high-fat meal could impair blood flow to the brain, potentially increasing the risk of stroke and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary fat is an important part of our diet. It provides us with a concentrated source of energy, transports  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="170438" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and when stored in the body, protects our organs and helps keep us warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two main types of fat that we consume are saturated and unsaturated (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated), which are differentiated by their chemical composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-a-high-fat-diet-may-increase-your-anxiety-study-warns"&gt;Eating a High-Fat Diet May Increase Your Anxiety, Study Warns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these fats have different effects on our body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, it is well established that eating a meal that is high in saturated fat, such as that self-indulgent Friday night takeaway pizza, can be bad for our blood vessels and heart health. And these effects are not simply confined to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain has limited energy stores, which means it is heavily reliant on a continuous supply of blood delivering oxygen and glucose to maintain normal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ways the body maintains this supply is through a process known as &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0271678X241235878"&gt;"dynamic cerebral autoregulation"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process ensures that blood flow to the brain remains stable despite everyday changes in blood pressure, such as standing up and exercising. It's like having shock absorbers that help keep our brains cool under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when this process is impaired, those swings in blood pressure become harder to manage. That can mean brief episodes of too little or too much blood reaching the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this increases the risk of developing conditions like stroke and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What role might diet play?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eating a meal high in saturated fat, levels of fat in the blood rise and peak after around four hours. At the same time, blood vessels become stiffer and lose their ability to relax and expand. This restricts blood flow around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But little is known about what happens to the brain during this time and how well its blood supply is protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this for the first time, we recruited 20 young men between the ages of 18 and 35, and 21 men between 60 and 80. We measured how well blood vessels linked to heart and brain health worked before, and four hours following, consumption of a meal high in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed how well a blood vessel in the arm could open up in response to increased blood flow to obtain an indication of heart health. This is a method known as &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00471.2010"&gt;"flow-mediated dilatation"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate how well blood vessels in the brain could cope with swings in blood pressure, our participants performed body-weight squats. We used ultrasound to determine how well blood flowed through vessels during both methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test meal was a milkshake, which we called "the brain bomb" because it consisted mostly of heavy whipping cream. The drink contained 1,362 calories and 130g of fat, mimicking the fat load of a fast-food takeaway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings confirmed previous research that has shown that a high-fat meal impairs the ability of the blood vessels linked to heart health to open in both young and old participants. These impairments reduced the brain's ability to buffer changes in blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was more pronounced (by about 10%) in the older adults, suggesting that older brains may be more vulnerable to the effects of the meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we didn't directly test for the long-term effects of a high-fat meal on mental functioning in this study, &lt;a href="https://portlandpress.com/clinsci/article-abstract/131/23/2807/71652/Post-prandial-hyperlipidaemia-results-in-systemic?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;we have previously shown&lt;/a&gt; that such a meal increases free radicals (unstable, cell-damaging molecules) and decreases nitric oxide (molecules that help blood vessels relax and open up to transport oxygen and glucose around the body).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may explain the reduced blood flow regulation we observed in our recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170513" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515.png" alt="Diagram showing how fat can stiffen arteries" class="wp-image-170513 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515.png 1920w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-642x416.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-640x415.png 640w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-768x498.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-1536x996.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-600x389.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170513" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Stiff arteries and a sluggish brain. (Chris Marley/Damian Bailey)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has important clinical implications. While an occasional takeaway is unlikely to cause harm on its own, our results suggest that even one fatty meal has an immediate effect on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study highlights the importance of consuming a diet that is low in saturated fat to protect not only our heart health, but also our brain health. This is particularly important for older adults whose brains appear to be more vulnerable to the effects of such a meal and are already at increased risk of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/different-fats-nutrition/"&gt;NHS recommendeds&lt;/a&gt; that men consume no more than 30g of saturated fat a day, while women should consume no more than 20g. Yet many of us routinely exceed that, particularly during weekend takeaways, pub lunches or fast-food splurges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, we may spend much of our waking lives in a post-meal state. This period, known as &lt;a href="https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-017-0568-5"&gt;"post-prandial lipaemia"&lt;/a&gt;, is when fat levels are elevated, and when the body, it seems, may be most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Food for thought&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's still so much more we need to learn about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/different-fats-nutrition/"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; recommends swapping saturated fats for polyunsaturated ones. These are found in foods like oily fish, walnuts and seeds, which are associated with better heart and brain health over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we don't yet know how the brain responds to a single meal that is high in polyunsaturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor do we know how the female brain responds to a high-fat meal. This is a crucial gap in our knowledge since women face a greater risk of &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000950"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00249-8/fulltext"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; in later life compared to men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study offers a timely reminder that diet doesn't just shape our long-term health.

Stratus was first detected in Southeast Asia in January, but didn’t show up in U.S. surveillance reports until May. The World Health Organization classified XFG as a “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf?sfvrsn=fab54cd7_1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;variant under monitoring&lt;/a&gt;” in June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting a full picture of COVID-19 activity can be difficult given shifting priorities in federal and state health policy. But several key measures help put together a picture of what’s happening in New York.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC said that as of July 29, its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/rt-estimates/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 forecasting models&lt;/a&gt; show infection rates in New York are growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the projections show infections are growing or likely to grow in 40 states and are unchanged in nine others. The highest rates of transmission are in the South, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast and Midwest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The public health agency also said COVID &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;viral activity in wastewater&lt;/a&gt; remains “low” nationally, but at least 10 states had “high” or “very high” levels, as of July 12. With 29 sites reporting, viral activity in New York is currently low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the seven-day period ending July 31, 0.7 percent of &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#ed-visits_separated_by_age_group" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt; in New York had been for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although hoarseness is unique to Stratus, symptoms common to other variants include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sore throat, congestion and runny nose, loss of taste or smell, fatigue, muscle and body aches, headache, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stratus variant may be better than others at evading immunity protection, according to experts. Although &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine guidance is changing&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC website still says the COVID-19 vaccine helps protect against “severe illness, hospitalization and death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 17:52:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>富人喜爱的“健康”食品现在与Lou Gehrig病有关-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxOTUk3ZjlBZFo0WlVmU3hjYk5LS2JyRXFWMVVoanNFUjJtQVZoWm1oeE80dDNJa0xIcmtId1JtLURMSzl1Q0xVbFdEV3NfaHdUd1lzUmtwUVlhZzBGN1R4MFVhdUp0c0UzdTJLallrT0c0ejlLQTM0RUE4SjRZWVNidXU1MUVWOW1ENTd5R25UVUhWY0Jtemk4Sk1QY3VSUG0xdTJ3LWN5ZFJRcVNyWG1XNjh1SHM3OGxCZzAxa18wcl9nQlEw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The toxic cousin of a gourmet delicacy could put foodies at risk of a devastating and irreversible neurological disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A true morel is one of the most luxurious and sought-after &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13210479/deadly-morel-mushroom-CDC-Montana.html"&gt;wild mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;, often featured in high-end cuisine from risotto to a cream sauce over steak due to its earthy, nutty flavor and exclusive seasonal availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Morels are coveted in the culinary world and morel mushrooms in general contain a lot of vitamin D, which is essential for immune and brain health. They are also low-fat and can be part of a heart-healthy diet. However, they have deceptive, poisonous lookalikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;False morels have tricked amateur foragers and garnered true fans in a town called Montchavin, a village in the French Alps, for their 'rejuvenating' properties. Despite their name, though, they belong to an entirely different family of fungi, the Gyromitra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;False morels contain compounds called hydrazines that are toxic to the nervous system. While eating one may cause abdominal pain and diarrhea, in severe cases, a false morel can cause seizures and multi-organ failure. Gyromitrin, the main toxin in the mushroom, is also a carcinogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, scientists believe they've found a link between false morels and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14606543/footage-impact-motor-neurone-disease-healthy-woman.html"&gt;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (ALS) in Montchavin, as a mysterious cluster of cases has developed over the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and, in some parts of the world, motor neurone disease, ALS is a fatal neurological disorder that progressively paralyzes patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Montchavin has a permanent population of about 200 people, and the average global diagnosis rate of ALS is two to three diagnoses per 100,000 people annually. Yet in the last decade, there have been 16 cases reported in Montchavin, far more than what would be expected.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Over a period of about 10 years, 16 residents of a ski village in the French Alps, out of a population of 200, had ALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If made comparable to a rate in 100,000 people per year, Montchavin's rate would be 800 cases per 100,000 residents per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The search for answers was led by Dr Emmeline Lagrange, a neurologist practising at Grenoble University Hospital, 84 miles southwest of the village. A resident of Montchavin who had been experiencing neurological issues had been referred to Lagrange, who diagnosed them with ALS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She would later learn on a call with the patient’s referring physician in Montchavin that this was one of several ALS cases in the small mountain village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;None of the patients had a gene mutation making them more susceptible to ALS or a family history of the disease, which causes continuously worsening paralysis over time, leading to death after two to five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists are still investigating the cause of ALS, which affects roughly 33,000 Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetics are behind between 10 and 15 percent of cases, while the rest could be tied to environmental exposures, including toxic pollution, smoking, exposure to heavy metals like lead and mercury, and a history of head injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lagrange published an abstract summarizing her investigation into the unusual ALS cluster, which caught the eye of environmental neuroscientist Dr Peter Spencer of the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University in Portland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spencer is the leading proponent of a separate theory linking food to the degenerative disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His theory was that toxins in cycad seeds, once a staple of Guam’s Chamorro people, triggered an epidemic of Western Pacific ALS-Parkinsonism dementia (ALS-PDC). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At its peak, ALS-PDC was 50 to 100 times more common in Guam than ALS rates worldwide. In the 1950s, incidence rates reached about 200 per 100,000 among Chamorro adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has investigated the link for more than four decades, arguing that a compound in cycad seeds called cycasin metabolizes into a neurotoxic DNA-damaging byproduct called methylazoxymethanol (MAM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MAM is also formed when the body metabolizes hydrazine, a volatile chemical used in rocket fuels and also found in false morels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;A true morel is a gourmet delicacy, though it must be properly cooked or could be poisonous. True morels are often featured in Michelin-starred restaurants and in high-end cuisine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The false morel [shown] is often reddish-brown, whereas true morels are typically green or gray. False morels are also a different shape and have brain-like folds and ridges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Spencer saw a presentation of Lagrange’s abstract, his mind lingered on one line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2024/did-eating-false-mushrooms-cause-als-french-village"&gt;Knowable Magazine&lt;/a&gt;: ‘I noted that among the foodstuffs they reported were mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I asked them what type of mushrooms, because one particular type contains poisons associated with the Guam problem.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They began collaborating on a study. Lagrange had learned that the ALS patients in Montchavin had been purposely seeking out false morels, believing they had rejuvenating properties, despite their illegal status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A villager told Lagrange: ‘They are always in a group, a secret group, a social network, and they eat the mushrooms. And they all knew that it’s forbidden.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers included those patients in their study, as well as 48 villagers without the disease who ate wild mushrooms, but not false morels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some ALS patients had a history of collecting up to six pounds of the poisonous fungi during the spring and summer and eating them throughout the year. People who had been diagnosed with ALS had been eating the mushrooms for as long as 20 years before ALS symptoms arose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘All ALS cases but none of the controls had a history of consuming acutely poisonous False Morels, notably the Snow Morel Gyromitra gigas,’ Lagrange &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(21)00252-5/fulltext"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Neuroscientist Emmeline Lagrange spearheaded the investigation into the ALS cluster in the French Alps, determining from a lengthy investigation that ALS patients shared something in common: their love for false morels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Since no other significant chemical or physical exposure was found, the primary risk factor for ALS in this community appears to be repeated ingestion of these neurotoxic fungi.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the false morel’s toxicity, it is a delicacy in parts of Scandinavia, where Michelin-starred restaurants incorporate it on seasonal menus for its tang and nuttiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finnish people are such big fans that the species was featured on a 1974 postage stamp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;False morels are also endorsed by the Finnish Food Authority, which advises people to repeatedly boil and rinse fresh or dried specimens before eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite their differences in appearance, amateur foragers often confuse true morels with false ones, which resemble a reddish brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A June 2024 Toxicon study identified &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0041010124003970?via%3Dihub"&gt;118 false morel poisonings&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan between 2002 and 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the patients suffered from vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, while more than a dozen developed liver damage.

Three to five days after those symptoms, a characteristic rash appears,” said Rachel Mugleston, RN, Health Strategies Program Manager at Eastern Idaho Public Health. “Measles is highly contagious and can be spread for four days before and four days after the rash appears.”   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EIPH also reminds residents that although measles is considered a childhood disease, it can be contracted at any age. “Eastern Idaho Public Health encourages everyone to check their vaccination records with their primary care provider,” officials stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The best way to protect you and your family from infection is through up-to-date vaccination for measles/mumps/rubella (MMR),” Thursday’s statement reported. “The measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after receiving two doses.”  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, if you believe you may have been exposed to anyone with measles, contact your health care provider and monitor yourself for symptoms for 21 days after exposure, according to EIPH. Public health officials will observe those known to have been exposed to the infected individual. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;ORIGINAL STORY&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;IDAHO FALLS – A case of measles in an “adolescent” has been reported locally by Eastern Idaho Public Health, according to a statement released Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials stated the “adolescent was an international traveler who was unvaccinated against measles.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EIPH is investigating the case, according to health officials there, who said the child was seen by a “healthcare provider for symptoms of measles and was not hospitalized.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thursday’s statement reported the child had “self-isolated during the contagious period” and was no longer contagious. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“EIPH does not expect exposure to the public, outside of household contacts who are currently being monitored for potential infection,” health officials stated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is a serious, highly contagious disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The measles virus can easily spread through the air and can survive in the air for up to two hours after an infected individual has left, according to EIPH officials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About one in five unvaccinated people in the United States who have measles is hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who have received the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine, have had measles in the past, or were born before 1957 are considered immune to the measles virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/08/measles-detected-in-wastewater-in-coeur-dalene-but-no-idaho-cases-reported-amid-national-outbreak/"&gt;Measles detected in wastewater in Coeur d’Alene.

Despite their name, though, they belong to an entirely different family of fungi, the Gyromitra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;False morels contain compounds called hydrazines that are toxic to the nervous system. While eating one may cause abdominal pain and diarrhea, in severe cases, a false morel can cause seizures and multi-organ failure. Gyromitrin, the main toxin in the mushroom, is also a carcinogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, scientists believe they've found a link between false morels and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14606543/footage-impact-motor-neurone-disease-healthy-woman.html"&gt;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (ALS) in Montchavin, as a mysterious cluster of cases has developed over the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and, in some parts of the world, motor neurone disease, ALS is a fatal neurological disorder that progressively paralyzes patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Montchavin has a permanent population of about 200 people, and the average global diagnosis rate of ALS is two to three diagnoses per 100,000 people annually. Yet in the last decade, there have been 16 cases reported in Montchavin, far more than what would be expected.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Over a period of about 10 years, 16 residents of a ski village in the French Alps, out of a population of 200, had ALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If made comparable to a rate in 100,000 people per year, Montchavin's rate would be 800 cases per 100,000 residents per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The search for answers was led by Dr Emmeline Lagrange, a neurologist practicing at Grenoble University Hospital, 84 miles southwest of the village. A resident of Montchavin who had been experiencing neurological issues had been referred to Lagrange, who diagnosed them with ALS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She would later learn on a call with the patient’s referring physician in Montchavin that this was one of several ALS cases in the small mountain village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;None of the patients had a gene mutation making them more susceptible to ALS or a family history of the disease, which causes continuously worsening paralysis over time, leading to death after two to five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists are still investigating the cause of ALS, which affects roughly 33,000 Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetics are behind between 10 and 15 percent of cases, while the rest could be tied to environmental exposures, including toxic pollution, smoking, exposure to heavy metals like lead and mercury, and a history of head injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lagrange published an abstract summarizing her investigation into the unusual ALS cluster, which caught the eye of environmental neuroscientist Dr Peter Spencer of the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University in Portland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spencer is the leading proponent of a separate theory linking food to the degenerative disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His theory was that toxins in cycad seeds, once a staple of Guam’s Chamorro people, triggered an epidemic of Western Pacific ALS-Parkinsonism dementia (ALS-PDC). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At its peak, ALS-PDC was 50 to 100 times more common in Guam than ALS rates worldwide. In the 1950s, incidence rates reached about 200 per 100,000 among Chamorro adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has investigated the link for over four decades, arguing that a compound in cycad seeds called cycasin metabolizes into a neurotoxic DNA-damaging byproduct called methylazoxymethanol (MAM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MAM is also formed when the body metabolizes hydrazine, a volatile chemical used in rocket fuels and also found in false morels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;A true morel is a gourmet delicacy, though it must be properly cooked or could be poisonous. True morels are often featured in Michelin-starred restaurants and in high-end cuisine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The false morel [shown] is often reddish-brown, whereas true morels are typically green or gray. False morels are also a different shape and has brain-like folds and ridges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Spencer saw a presentation of Lagrange’s abstract, his mind lingered on one line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2024/did-eating-false-mushrooms-cause-als-french-village"&gt;Knowable Magazine&lt;/a&gt;: ‘I noted that among the foodstuffs they reported were mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I asked them what type of mushrooms, because one particular type contains poisons associated with the Guam problem.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They began collaborating on a study. Lagrange had learned that the ALS patients in Montchavin had been purposely seeking out false morels, believing they had rejuvenating properties, despite their illegal status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A villager told Lagrange: ‘They are always in a group, a secret group, a social network, and they eat the mushrooms. And they all knew that it’s forbidden.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers included those patients in their study, as well as 48 villagers without the disease who ate wild mushrooms, but not false morels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some ALS patients had a history of collecting up to six pounds of the poisonous fungi during the spring and summer and eating them throughout the year. People who had been diagnosed with ALS had been eating the mushrooms for as long as 20 years before ALS symptoms arose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘All ALS cases but none of the controls had a history of consuming acutely poisonous False Morels, notably the Snow Morel Gyromitra gigas,’ Lagrange &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(21)00252-5/fulltext"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Neuroscientist Emmeline Lagrange spearheaded the investigation into the ALS cluster in the French Alps, determining from a lengthy investigation that ALS patients shared something in common: their love for false morels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Since no other significant chemical or physical exposure was found, the primary risk factor for ALS in this community appears to be repeated ingestion of these neurotoxic fungi.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the false morel’s toxicity, it is a delicacy in parts of Scandinavia, where Michelin-starred restaurants incorporate it on seasonal menus for its tang and nuttiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Finns are such big fans that the species was featured on a 1974 postage stamp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;False morels are also endorsed by the Finnish Food Authority, which advises people to repeatedly boil and rinse fresh or dried specimens before eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite their differences in appearance, amateur foragers often confuse true morels with false ones, which resemble a reddish brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A June 2024 Toxicon study identified &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0041010124003970?via%3Dihub"&gt;118 false morel poisonings&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan between 2002 and 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the patients suffered from vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, while over a dozen developed liver damage.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The researchers studied brain tissue of about 400 people post mortem, as well as blood samples and a battery of memory tests performed yearly before their death. The scientists found higher levels of lithium in cognitively healthy people. But as sticky clumps of protein, known as amyloid plaques, began forming in their brains in the early stages of dementia, the amyloid trapped the lithium, restraining it and reducing its availability to surrounding brain cells. That depleted the lithium even in parts of the brain that were amyloid-free, essentially reducing lithium’s protective function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The researchers also fed healthy mice a lithium-restricted diet, spurring memory problems: they had trouble performing several laboratory memory tests. And finally, the researchers were also able to reverse disease-related damage and restore memory function, even in older mice with advanced disease, by returning lithium to their diet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="what_kind_of_lithium_was_used_in" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

They used &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11954165/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11954165/"&gt;lithium orotate,&lt;/a&gt; which is a compound that is able to evade the sticky amyloid plaques in our brains. The type of lithium used to treat psychiatric disorders is lithium carbonate, but it can be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5537577/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5537577/"&gt;hard on people’s kidneys&lt;/a&gt; and toxic to elderly patients. The amount of lithium orotate used by the Harvard team was one-thousandth the level, essentially mimicking the amount naturally found in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="should_you_buy_lithium_online_or_in" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

So there’s no way to tell whether the substance actually contains lithium and, if so, in what amounts, or whether it contains contaminants. Generally, a firm does not have to provide the FDA with the evidence it relies on to substantiate safety before or after it markets its products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="how_else_should_i_get_lithium_in" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

It’s about whether we’ll be ready when the next crisis hits. Cutting mRNA development now puts every American at greater risk,” Rick Bright, who directed BARDA in the early stages of the pandemic before being reassigned by the Trump administration, told &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cuts-500-million-mrna-vaccine-contracts-dealing-major-blow-prom-rcna223281" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBC News;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The decision doesn’t mean that research into mRNA vaccines will stop entirely, but it does cut off a major source of funding that helped the vaccines become a reality in the first place. By the time the pandemic had started, the government had already given an estimated &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9975718/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$337 million;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;$337 million&lt;/a&gt; in grants for research into mRNA vaccines.

In the most basic terms, it’s a piece of genetic code that tells our cells what to do.

These types of vaccines can take a long time to develop because they rely on the slow, often complicated process of cultivating and modifying the actual virus into a safe and effective form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Using mRNA is much faster because the crucial ingredients can be created and customized in a lab. It took Moderna just &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-designed-coronavirus-vaccine-in-2-days-2020-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:two days;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;two days&lt;/a&gt; to produce its mRNA vaccine for COVID in January 2020, before most people had ever even heard of the virus. The vaccines carry a snippet of mRNA that instructs the body to produce a small portion of a virus, usually a protein on its outer membrane, which is enough to trigger the same type of immune response that is prompted by traditional vaccines. The quicker process also means that existing mRNA vaccines can be modified more rapidly when viruses evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite Kennedy’s claims, mRNA-based COVID vaccines &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8548286/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:have been found;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;have been found&lt;/a&gt; to be just as effective at preventing severe infections and death as vaccines made using other methods.

That speed could be especially important if a novel flu strain, like &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/28/nx-s1-5414642/trump-vaccine-bird-flu-mrna" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bird flu;cpos:18;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, causes a severe outbreak.

&lt;p&gt;Chopping onions is a fundamental cooking skill that many home chefs dread due to the inevitable tears that follow. Recent scientific research from Cornell University has finally provided a definitive answer to this culinary conundrum. Their findings reveal that the key to tear-free onion cutting lies in two simple factors: using a sharp knife and cutting slowly. This breakthrough could transform how we approach this essential kitchen task and make meal preparation more enjoyable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The science behind onion tears&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you slice into an onion, you’re breaking open cells that contain enzymes and sulfur compounds. These components mix together and create syn-propanethial-S-oxide, a volatile gas that rises through the air and irritates the sensitive membranes in your eyes. Your eyes respond to this irritation by producing tears to wash away the irritant.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Cornell University conducted detailed experiments to understand exactly how this irritating compound gets released during cutting. Using a specially designed guillotine fitted with different blades, they meticulously documented the spray patterns produced when cutting onions under various conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The research team captured high-speed footage&lt;/strong&gt; of onion juice ejection during cutting, allowing them to analyze precisely how much spray was produced and what factors influenced it. This methodical approach finally provided scientific validation for what many chefs have long suspected about knife sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The relationship between our dietary choices and bodily functions extends beyond cooking techniques. Research has shown that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/the-brain-can-change-intestinal-bacteria-in-a-couple-of-hours/"&gt;the brain can change intestinal bacteria in a couple of hours&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting how interconnected our body systems truly are.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sharp knives create fewer tears&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cornell study conclusively demonstrated that knife sharpness plays a crucial role in determining how much onion spray is produced during cutting. &lt;em&gt;Dull blades significantly increase both the speed and number of ejected droplets&lt;/em&gt; that carry the tear-inducing compound.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When using a blunt knife, the researchers observed that the blade tends to push down on the onion’s layers before actually cutting through them. This compression forces the layers to bend inward, storing elastic energy. As the cut progresses, these compressed layers spring back, forcefully ejecting juice into the air – and ultimately into your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In contrast, sharp blades slice cleanly through the onion’s cellular structure with minimal compression. This precision cutting reduces the amount of juice that gets sprayed into the surrounding air, resulting in fewer tears for the person doing the chopping.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a healthy lifestyle includes not just proper cooking techniques but also regular exercise. Studies show that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/take-10000-steps-a-day-if-you-can-well-but-already-7000-they-keep-in-health/"&gt;taking 7,000 steps daily can significantly improve health&lt;/a&gt;, making it an achievable goal for most people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cutting speed matters&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second critical factor identified by the Cornell researchers was cutting speed. Contrary to what many might assume, &lt;strong&gt;faster cutting actually produces more tears&lt;/strong&gt;, not fewer. The research team found that rapid cutting motions generated more juice and created a finer mist of the irritating compound that more easily reaches the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slowing down your cutting motion allows for more control and precision, which results in less spray. This measured approach might take a few extra seconds, but the comfort gained is well worth the minimal additional time investment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are the key techniques to implement for tear-free onion cutting:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a professionally sharpened chef’s knife&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cut with deliberate, slow movements&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Minimize compression of the onion layers&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Maintain proper ventilation in your kitchen&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Consider chilling the onion briefly before cutting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding how we interact with food extends beyond cooking techniques. Research indicates that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/there-is-a-lost-memory-of-the-meals-that-makes-us-eat-more-than-necessary/"&gt;there is a lost memory of meals that makes us eat more than necessary&lt;/a&gt;, showing how our relationship with food is influenced by psychological factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our early development can also affect our overall health trajectory. Studies have found that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/growth-in-the-first-1000-days-of-life-affects-adult-stature/"&gt;growth in the first 1,000 days of life affects adult stature&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing the importance of proper nutrition from an early age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Additional benefits beyond comfort&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cornell researchers noted that adopting these proper cutting techniques offers benefits beyond just preventing tears. &lt;em&gt;Minimizing airborne spray during food preparation can reduce the spread of potential pathogens in kitchen environments&lt;/em&gt;, contributing to overall food safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important when cutting vegetables with tough outer layers that store significant elastic energy. The proper technique not only improves comfort but also supports better kitchen hygiene practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Knife Condition&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Cutting Speed&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Tear Production&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Airborne Spray&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sharp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Slow&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Minimal&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sharp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Fast&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Moderate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Moderate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dull&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Slow&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Moderate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Moderate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dull&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Fast&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Excessive&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent medical research has identified interesting connections between medications and mental health, such as &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/a-new-connection-between-the-competitive-drugs-of-the-glp-1-and-the-depression/"&gt;a new connection between GLP-1 drugs and depression&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the complex interplay between different body systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Food waste remains a significant issue in modern society. Studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/the-invisible-food-waste-of-the-canteens-a-chasm-of-costs-and-food-thrown/"&gt;the invisible food waste in canteens creates enormous costs&lt;/a&gt;, making efficient food preparation techniques all the more important.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The broader impact of proper technique&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mastering the art of onion cutting not only improves your culinary experience but also contributes to better health outcomes. &lt;strong&gt;Reducing eye irritation makes cooking more enjoyable&lt;/strong&gt;, potentially encouraging more home-cooked meals. This can lead to healthier eating patterns and greater control over ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The precision skills developed through proper cutting techniques transfer to other aspects of cooking as well. Improving knife skills generally leads to more consistent food preparation, better presentation, and ultimately more satisfying meals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity complements good nutrition for overall health. Research has shown that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/exercise-fights-cancer-now-we-understand-how/"&gt;exercise fights cancer through specific biological mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; that scientists are now beginning to understand fully.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The humble onion, found in cuisines worldwide from Italian pasta sauces to Indian curries, no longer needs to be a source of kitchen frustration. With the scientifically validated combination of a sharp knife and slow cutting motion, you can incorporate this flavorful vegetable into your cooking without reaching for tissues or resorting to swimming goggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

It was first detected in Southeast Asia in January but didn’t appear in U.S. surveillance reports until May.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization classified XFG as a “variant under monitoring” in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting a full picture of COVID-19 activity can be difficult given shifting priorities in federal and state health policy. But several key measures help put together a picture of what’s happening in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;CDC: COVID-19 Cases Likely Growing Again In Minnesota&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of July 29, the CDC estimates a 91.85 percent probability that COVID-19 is growing in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state’s epidemic trend is officially classified as growing, with a reproductive rate (Rt) of 1.05, meaning each infection is leading to more than one new case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emergency department visits for COVID-19 remain very low, making up just 0.38 percent of total ED visits statewide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;National Picture&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Projections show infections are growing or likely to grow in 40 states and are unchanged in nine others. The highest rates of transmission are in the South, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and Midwest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC also said COVID viral activity in wastewater remains “low” nationally, though at least 10 states had “high” or “very high” levels as of July 12.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Minnesota, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wastewater viral activity is currently low, with 25 sites reporting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although hoarseness appears to be unique to Stratus, other common symptoms include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, loss of taste or smell, fatigue, muscle and body aches, headache, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health experts say the Stratus variant may be better than others at evading immunity. While vaccine guidance is evolving, the CDC still says COVID-19 vaccination helps protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 14:26:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPVTNwRDRYTW1PNENYMl9SWTNvSm1vYzhVby0wNmtIZXF0ZWlYZm1GSlItY1ZFRl9HTTI5clY5bkVsb3p6cVFRMVZuU3ZHcnBVbkhsWW9NQ1NpN2poSlRScC1nZjR5eDdDNVlZY3JYc2xCVm8yUUFXanRsczc2OE53WHA2Q1JfUlNsYWE4dGxvOWIxNXFiOFlV0gG3AUFVX3lxTE5UbEZVT0I5RWtDc0RoZ3ZCQ0ZpN3YwVUVyUzVZM1EzZk5xZVZ4b2pURW1WVWJYaDE3ak5RWTBkXzE3MXVyY1cyanhOOTNJZGRPTGxwc2xkYWxDV0hnWEZQUF96Sjg0MmJ3UmtqWjhTTUVSbEZQRnM0Z1Z6UjRaQktjOXliQkVJa2NrZUZnbGVwTE94b08zdjNuUEZFVzRMZUt5RGZxbGR0V3lLN2pNb3lfR1Fqd1dlbw</guid></item><item><title>纽约市的退伍军人疾病集群导致3人死亡， 70多人患病。它是什么，您如何获得它？ - yahoo.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi_wFBVV95cUxOdnFTRzQ1MGp0OE1tNnBKRWFBVWlkNUw4cDczYVBwWlhCSW90UFduRE4zR19pbFdJZkNGR29zb0MyN3B1UUdaRGxVWmZWX1hROEtTVV9UMzlfQWFrX05IbUEtazNObXdZNGhaYU1XUXVzVkJVbTgwZ0tWUkhtVDdGM1VNNmVCTjRvSWtPZVZfeE5YbVF0Y19TRThtV2FCODNXV0hFUkwybzhWUFFwUUhfYXBwZ3h3RFV0eS1VX2wwOXNMbU5vZ3dCRDhZTVFrZkU2aXhJUHp2WkswQ1pLVWdzUEhYOV9OWTFqdjlkY0tmMldGcUZaNTVDUGtHSXpWajg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Three people have died and over 70 people have been sickened by Legionnaires’ disease amid a cluster discovered in central Harlem in New York City, according to an update from &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/legionnaires-disease.page" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:health officials Wednesday;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;health officials Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The disease was initially detected on July 25.

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors were left baffled by a rare condition that saw a 20-year-old woman experience multiple orgasms several times a day, leaving her constantly sexually aroused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Far from being pleasurable, the unnamed woman said the disorder caused her intense distress and interfered with her work and social life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From the age of 14 she also suffered with sharp 'electric sensations' in her groin and pelvic contractions resembling orgasms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite multiple treatments, including antidepressants, her symptoms persisted, causing her to believe that her orgasms were being externally manipulated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she finally visited a hospital in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-8aaaf240-738c-11f0-a385-f3c2bc710464"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; desperate to get help, her condition had progressed to the point that she could not get through the initial consultation without suffering an episode. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neurologists were left clueless after ruling out epilepsy and a host of other neurological disorders through ECG monitoring and other tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On physical examination, the patients also showed no structural abnormalities that could have been affecting her reproductive organs and triggering feelings of arousal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually doctors diagnosed her with persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) after a course of antipsychotic medication - risperidone and later olanzapine - proved promising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Far from being pleasurable, the young woman said her orgasmic episodes completely dismantled her work and social life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a few weeks of treatment, her symptoms began to subside and her delusions improved, enabling her to return to work and resume social commitments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it was observed that when she stopped taking the drugs, her symptoms returned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disorder is still widely misunderstood and is thought to affect just one per cent of people living in the UK, most of which are women, although experts say the condition is underdiagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors remain uncertain what cause the complex condition, but it is thought to result from the misfiring of nerves that connect the brain and the genitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst there is no specific cure, patients can take various medications that work by suppressing nerve signals, in the hope of easing symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PGAD symptoms vary widely but commonly include genital pain and discomfort and intense sensations of arousal without sexual desire or stimulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Possible physical causes include nerve damage, spinal abnormalities and medication side-effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies also suggest that stress and anxiety may worsen symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors found that her symptoms greatly improved when she started taking anti-psychotic medication, which dampens the dopamine response in the brain &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other schools of thought claim that the disorder is linked to problems with dopamine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commonly referred to as the happiness hormone, dopamine is a key neurotransmitter involved in the brain's pleasure and reward system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought that excess dopamine may amplify sexual arousal, and could theoretically produce orgasmic episodes and other PGAD symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It follows that the use of dopamine inhibitors such as risperidone and olanzapine may help lessen these abnormal sexual sensations by dampening the dopamine response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors led by Jing Yan and Dafang Ouyang, affiliated with several national mental health institutions in Beijing, say case studies like these play a vital role in medical advances providing evidence for widely misunderstood disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, researchers acknowledge that case studies describe one individual, making it difficult to draw conclusions about cause and effect without taking into consideration confounding factors such as age, sex and medical history.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
