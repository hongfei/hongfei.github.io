    &lt;p&gt;For Lacy Cornelius Boyd, March 19, 2024, was an exciting day. She and her husband had taken their 6-year-old daughter to the Grand Canyon as part of a family road trip. Boyd, her husband and their daughter were planning to stop at McDonald's before heading home to Oklahoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything was well — until their car hit a patch of black ice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were spinning. My husband obviously lost control, and he hit another car head-on," Boyd recalled. Everything else was a blur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd's daughter had a broken arm. Her husband and the other driver were fine. Boyd had broken bones in her neck and ribs, a collapsed lung, and severe injuries to her intestines. She had six surgeries in five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the damage to her intestines — caused by a too-tight seatbelt — kept getting worse, Boyd said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They were trying to save my intestines, and every time they would go back in, they were just dying from no blood flow," Boyd said. "I was told that most people have 35 feet of small intestine. I was left with about 35 inches." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;"Just going through the motions"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd was discharged from the hospital after a month. She was diagnosed with short bowel syndrome and had an ileostomy bag attached to her side to collect waste. Her remaining intestines couldn't process the nutrients from food, so she needed 12 hours of IV nutrition a day. She said her daughter was afraid of the tubes, wires and medical machines that now filled their home. Boyd was always weak and dehydrated, and never wanted to leave the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I went out to eat somewhere, I'd be in the bathroom immediately, or I'd have to go to the bathroom five times at a restaurant, so it was just embarrassing," Boyd said. "I felt like everyone was enjoying their life and I was just going through the motions." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Boyd, who had previously worked in healthcare, regularly met with doctors to see if her quality of life could be improved. No one had answers. Finally, she followed up on an unlikely lead. During her hospitalization, a surgeon had told Boyd's sister she should contact the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boyd self-referred herself to the hospital system in November 2024. She met with general surgeon Dr. Masato Fujiki and after an evaluation, he suggested something she'd never heard of before: An intestinal transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I started crying. I think he thought I was sad, but I was really happy," Boyd said. "Everyone had told me that was going to be my life." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A rare, risky transplant &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intestinal transplants are a rare procedure, said Dr. Adam Griesemer, a transplant surgeon at NYU Langone. Only about 100 are done in the U.S. every year, compared to the 25,000 kidney transplants done annually, said Fujiki, the director of Cleveland Clinic's Intestinal Transplant Program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intestinal transplants have the worst outcomes of any type of transplant, Griesemer said, so there is a "high threshold" for doctors to consider them. They are generally only recommended for children born with intestinal defects and people who will be dependent on IV nutrition for the rest of their lives, like Boyd, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intestinal transplant patients "really struggle with rejection and infections," Griesemer said. Intestines harbor bacteria inside them, so during cases of organ rejection, the barrier preventing the bacteria from entering the bloodstream breaks down. Fujiki said rejection rates have been improving over the past decade, estimating that it has decreased from 40% of cases to about 8%. Medication can help reduce infections, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 50% of patients survive more than five years after receiving the transplant, Griesemer said. In comparison, kidney transplants have a 98% five-year survival rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Prepared for the worst"  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd began the process of getting listed for an intestinal transplant in November. In July 2025, 16 months after the car crash, Boyd received the transplant at the Cleveland Clinic. The day of the operation was filled with emotion, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I was excited. I was nervous. I was sad about leaving my daughter, and I felt for the donor's family," Boyd said. "But really, I was prepared for the worst." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The operation took about 12 hours, Fujiki said. Everything went smoothly. But it was just the first step in a long process: Boyd spent the next three weeks recovering in the hospital, followed by three months of outpatient recovery in Cleveland so she could stay near her care team for close monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd had no complications in her recovery, Fujiki said. Her ostomy bag was removed. She no longer needed IV nutrition. The weekend before Thanksgiving, she returned to Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was amazing to be able to come home," Boyd said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A festive return home &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd arrived home just in time for beloved holiday traditions. After missing other milestones, like her daughter's first day of school and Halloween, Boyd was relieved to be a part of the celebrations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My daughter is six now, but my husband carries her to the Christmas tree every morning to get her presents. I don't know how much longer she's going to let him do that," Boyd said. "I was like, 'This year might be the last time, and I'll miss it.' But I didn't." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd remains on a regimen of anti-rejection medications and will continue to receive follow-up care at the Cleveland Clinic. Otherwise, normalcy reigns, and it feels like the last of the trauma from the crash has been repaired, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's nice to take my daughter to school, pick her up, not have to worry about anything, to take her and to be able to go out to eat. I couldn't drink Coke before. I couldn't do normal things for like, a year and a half," Boyd said. "It's so much. Everyone is just a little bit more at peace." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Everything had been leading to the meeting early last year in Zanzibar, a tropical archipelago off the east coast of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A hundred researchers, clinicians and other experts on HIV from across Africa and beyond were there to discuss big plans — the development of an innovative vaccine on the continent that could prevent the disease, which continues to infect and kill people disproportionately in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And they had big money to do it. This group, called the &lt;a href="https://africanalliance.org.za/brilliant-consortium-shut-down-home-page/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BRILLIANT Consortium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, had landed a $45 million grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I mean, it's unprecedented," says &lt;a href="https://www.nicd.ac.za/communicable-diseases-researcher-directory/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nonhlanhla Mkhize&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a medical scientist with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg, "having a consortium that is made up of African scientists working toward an African problem in our labs here in Africa."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106085" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Nonhlanhla Mkhize, a medical scientist with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg, called the HIV vaccine initiative once funded by USAID "unprecedented — having a consortium that is made up of African scientists working toward an African problem in our labs here in Africa."

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Year one of the five-year grant had been almost entirely virtual. Now, they were all here together in Zanzibar and ready to turn their expertise into action. All the presentations and discussions and arguments had coalesced around a solid plan to thwart the virus. The scientific advisory board endorsed the imminent launch of the vaccine trials.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I remember the excitement was through the roof," says Mkhize. "We were at the beginning of something big."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But just as the meeting was about to wrap up, the mood darkened.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new executive order signed by President Trump on the day of his inauguration, Jan. 20, 2025, had frozen all foreign aid pending a review. Soon, DOGE would begin its &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/g-s1-75222/usaid-trump-humanitarian-rubio-musk" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;decimation of USAID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — cutting programs, interrupting funding streams, letting people go, and generally sowing uncertainty within an agency that, for more than six decades, had provided global humanitarian aid and development assistance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The disruptions were starting to ricochet around the world, including at that gathering in Zanzibar.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I remember at the end of the meeting, a USAID colleague saying to me, 'I'm not sure if I'll see you again,'" says &lt;a href="https://www.samrc.ac.za/research/extramural-research-units/antibody-immunity" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Penny Moore&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. "I completely underestimated how much it would gut the program."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Shortly afterward, the official stop work orders were issued.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That was crushing because we were about to enroll our first participants within the trial," says Moore. "It takes months and months and months to gear up for a clinical trial.

                Once the USAID grant was canceled, there was a lot of unease. "I don't think any of us knew what was going to happen," says Dale Kitchin, a senior scientist at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. "There was generally a sense of alarm."

"There was generally a sense of alarm."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This story might have ended here.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In many ways, we've kind of had our legs cut off even as we're beginning to run the sprint," says &lt;a href="https://desmondtutuhealthfoundation.org.za/team-members/linda-gail-bekker/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Linda-Gail Bekker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who directs the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation at the University of Cape Town, one of the collaborating partners under the USAID grant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead, the team steeled their resolve. They knew the science was sound and the need was urgent. They insisted on finding a way forward.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106080" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                The scientists found new sources of funding to support a pared-down version of the HIV vaccine trial — none of it from the U.S. government. "I'm afraid we will have to do it with or without because this matters too much to not finish the work," says Linda-Gail Bekker, director of the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's no sugar-coating the problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This was all happening, according to Moore, at a critical time in the fight against HIV. She doesn't believe that treatments alone — including the recent introduction of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/11/18/g-s1-98178/hiv-prevention-drug-lenacapavir" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lenacapavir&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a twice-yearly injectable — will be enough. "We need to get to the point where we are finally ahead of the virus, and I think that the only way we can do that is through a vaccine," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Moore has been studying HIV for over 20 years, slowly piecing together a detailed portrait of the virus. Research on HIV by her and others has also taught scientists about how the human immune system functions more generally, which has facilitated advances against other ailments including COVID-19, RSV and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A good portion of Moore's work has been supported by the U.S. In her lab in Johannesburg, pieces of equipment, including refrigerators and centrifuges purchased with funds from USAID, have stickers from the agency plastered on them. Some contain the phrase: "from the American people."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106090" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

Some items, such as this flow cytometer used to isolate cells,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;contain the phrase: "from the American people." The reason, says Penny Moore, a virologist at the University of Witwatersrand, is "so that we remember who bought them for us."

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The reason, says Moore, is "so that we remember who bought them for us."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition to the equipment, Moore's research has relied on a group of 117 South African women who have contributed their blood regularly to her lab for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The people who are donating these samples live in the communities most ravaged by HIV," she says. "And they donate because they hope to see an end to an epidemic that is really real for them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The 20 years of samples are stored in a room arrayed with half a dozen large freezers. This is, essentially, Moore's career on ice. She cracks open the lid of one and pulls out a stack of frozen tubes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106089" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

        Tommy Trenchard for NPR
        
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"This is blood and cells and DNA," she says. "It's heavy and hard for me to lift. The amount we have learned from these freezers, it's just astonishing."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those findings include answering questions that helped lead to the vaccine that Moore and her team were about to start testing under the USAID grant, like — why is HIV so skilled at evading our bodies' defenses?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's like an M&amp;amp;M, in that it's completely covered by sugars," Moore explains. "And sugars are essentially invisible to the immune system. So it's very difficult for the immune system to see the virus at all." While other viruses, including the one that causes COVID-19, deploy these sugary shields to a lesser extent, Moore says HIV is the most accomplished when it comes to hiding within and from the human body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition, HIV is remarkably variable. The virus mutates frequently, making "every mistake it can every single day," says Moore. But not all mistakes are bad. "Very quickly, every mistake that survives turns into a swarm of viruses within one person, and they're all different from one another."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This allows the virus to evolve in different directions in different places, including within Africa. "The virus that they have in Kenya is not the same as the virus that we have in Botswana," she says. "It's not the same as the virus that they have in Senegal."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This diversity was a big reason why Moore was so excited to be working with colleagues from different African countries under the USAID grant. It would have allowed the testing of vaccine candidates on a range of flavors of the virus in different populations on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As for the vaccine itself, its origins began with a key insight that came out of Moore's lab, in part. A few years after becoming infected with HIV, a small fraction of the people donating blood developed something called broadly neutralizing antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These are "the kinds of antibodies that can recognize and neutralize a virus regardless of where that virus comes from," says Moore. "And in many cases, up to 90% of global viruses could be stopped by one antibody."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Broadly neutralizing antibodies are weird looking. "They're all freaks of nature," allows Moore. Some have really long arms. Some have super short arms. Their oddness gives them a way of dealing with that sugary exterior to get to the virus hiding within, which Moore likens to the chocolatey interior of the M&amp;amp;M.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When these rare antibodies appear naturally, they usually emerge too late to be of assistance to the person living with HIV. "The virus has already spread too much and they actually don't have such an effect," says Nigel Garrett, the chief scientific officer at the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So we need to bring it forward before someone gets infected — catch the virus before it enters the bloodstream," he adds, explaining the vaccine development strategy. "That is a journey. You have to prime the immune system, you have to then shepherd the immune system along and then you have to polish it to ensure the [production of] the right antibody against the circulating HIV viruses."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But because the antibodies are so strange, it's very difficult to coax the body to produce them in response to a vaccine. This is what the USAID grant was intended to do — set up a series of trials that could flexibly and quickly work out the best way to encourage the immune system to create legions of these special antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know what we're trying to do," Moore says. "I'm not saying we're around the corner. It's a tough virus, but I feel like we're closer than we have ever been, and that's why I'm so frustrated."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding a way forward again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After the cancelation of the USAID grant, everyone was just reeling. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There were a lot of hugs and there were a lot of tears and there was a lot of swearing on my part," says Moore.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;No one wanted to scrap the vaccine project. "A devastating thing, a funding cut, yes, but we will always find a way to come back fighting," says Sheetal Kassim, the Senior Research Officer with the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation. "We are fighters."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So the South African researchers on the team came up with an alternate plan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106077" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;They realized they'd have to scale back — make it a South Africa initiative only and reduce the scope of the trials. But they believed in the promise of what they had proposed, and they knew there was no time to waste. "It's important to keep the momentum going until we get to a stage where we have the epidemic under control," says Garrett.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Amelia Mfiki, the community liaison officer for the vaccine trials, the bottoming out of the USAID funding was a wakeup call.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is a great opportunity for South Africa to prove that we can do things in South Africa for South Africa with South African financing," she says. "We still need support from other countries, but we shouldn't be depending solely on them."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Still, there were many late nights and a lot of unease. "We were frantically writing grants to everybody who would have us — literally, any funder in any country on whether they might be willing to support the program," says Moore.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106078" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Handouts briefly summarize the forthcoming HIV vaccine trial and the kinds of participants being recruited. "Communities and participants are equal partners to the researchers and to the research itself," says Amelia Mfiki, the community liaison officer.

   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the project secured funding from the &lt;a href="https://www.samrc.ac.za/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;South African Medical Research Council&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the Gates Foundation (which provides financial support to NPR). It's about a twentieth of the original USAID grant and none of it is from the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The State Department did not respond to a request for comment about the withdrawal of funding for the trial and the possibility of future funding of such endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, after nearly a year of delays, screening of participants for the pared-down trials has begun.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the outskirts of Cape Town, a factory building stands tall in Philippi Village, an impoverished township where HIV is rampant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106087" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;"It's important to do the work not in these communities — but &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; these communities — because these are the communities that are most affected by HIV," explains Kassim. This is "where the disease burden is highest."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The factory has been converted into a multi-use space. Mfiki makes her way to a room where 20 or so young women are waiting. "I will explain to them the criteria and who should join the trial," she says. "And this is the community that we recruit on and look for potential participants in."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The women listen attentively to Mfiki as she speaks. She knows that over the years, their participation and that of others from their community has been critical for trialing treatments for HIV — which now includes vaccine candidates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Communities and participants are equal partners to the researchers and to the research itself," she says. That's because without participants, there can be no trials and progress against HIV will stall out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-106092" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Nandipha Mongo of Philippi Village was glad to have participated in an HIV trial recently. "I'm over the moon, man!," she says. For her, a vaccine against the virus would mean one thing — "living free."

   &lt;p&gt;Nandipha Mongo is one of the women attending today's meeting. She was part of another HIV trial recently, so she's not eligible to join the new vaccine trial. Still, Mongo, who's 25 years old, says she was very glad to be involved with this research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I'm over the moon, man!," she says proudly, acknowledging that she's making "a big difference."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mongo's community struggles with gender-based violence and unplanned pregnancies. HIV is forever stalking them. "Most of us are scared of getting HIV," she admits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For her, a vaccine against the virus would mean one thing — "living free," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first shots of the new trial start going into participants' arms next week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s especially important to pay attention to brain-related changes as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all cognitive changes are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/dementia" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="dementia" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696958dde4b00edae2a41576" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/dementia" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, some are. &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20478797" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Gregory Day" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696958dde4b00edae2a41576" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20478797" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Gregory Day&lt;/a&gt;, a behavioral neurologist and dementia specialist at Mayo Clinic in Florida, defines dementia as a “change in memory and thinking. So, something that’s different from before — and for me to consider it as dementia, it needs to interfere with daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is only expected to become more common in this country; recent research predicts 42% of American adults over 55 will have dementia in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding the signs of the disease and getting an early diagnosis, individuals and caretakers can better plan and prepare for the future, and potentially make decisions about care and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis can also help folks potentially get access to treatments that can help slow the progression of certain forms of dementia, experts told HuffPost. (Dementia is an umbrella term that describes multiple forms of cognitive impairment, with Alzheimer’s disease being the most common type.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early signs of dementia are important to know but can “run the gamut,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/stephanie-nothelle/2705234" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Stephanie Nothelle" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696958dde4b00edae2a41576" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/stephanie-nothelle/2705234" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Stephanie Nothelle&lt;/a&gt;, a geriatrician and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, but there tend to be a few that often present first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Short-term memory loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the thing that people often think about is short-term memory loss, and that really is common,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the same thing as momentarily forgetting the word you want to use or a one-off absentminded moment, like forgetting to grab your hat before going out for a walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s something like “having a conversation with someone and then a couple hours later, not remembering the details of that conversation,” explained Nothelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/jori-fleisher-md-msce-faan" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jori Fleisher" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696958dde4b00edae2a41576" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/jori-fleisher-md-msce-faan" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Jori Fleisher&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush University in Chicago, said that it’s also common for folks with short-term memory loss to repeat themselves in conversations and ask “the same questions frequently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A hard time holding on to things that they’ve learned recently. That’s a short-term memory issue,” Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Day, there are some real-world, practical issues he tends to look for as potential memory red flags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m looking for people who have made mistakes, maybe with medications, where they wouldn’t have before [such as forgetting to take it or taking a double dose], perhaps some difficulty keeping track of appointments and keeping the days straight, needing more reminders for that,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This short-term memory loss could also look like missing appointments or showing up on the wrong day or having difficulty finding their way along a familiar route, Day added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people are naturally more forgetful than others and have been that way all of their lives. That’s not worrisome. Instead, Day is concerned with “changes from before that are consistent or starting to become consistent, that are beginning to interfere with daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Trouble with the ‘planning part of your brain.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also common for people to experience trouble with “executive functioning,” which Nothelle describes as the “planning part of your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, if you have a complex task, [for example] you have to plan a dinner party and you’re having a hard time doing everything involved ... there’s all these little logistics and things to keep track of when planning something like a dinner party,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have to remember your guest’s dietary restrictions, plan out a menu, shop for ingredients, cook, arrange serving dishes, clean, make cocktails and choose a playlist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re not able to do that anymore, that can be a sign that there’s something going on,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;While dementia can present in many different ways, short-term memory loss and personality changes are among the early signs of the disease.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Personality changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another way that I have seen it manifest is people will have changes in their mood or their personality,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe a loved one who used to be very outgoing is now more shy or vice versa. Or maybe someone is more apathetic or, perhaps, more impulsive than they used to be. This isn’t normal aging or an older person just not having a filter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are all just reflections of subtle changes in the brain,” Nothelle noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Consistent trouble finding the right word.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common complaint and reason people seek medical attention is word-finding difficulty, Day said. “Occasional difficulty coming up with a name, fine,” said Day. It’s also normal to sometimes forget the name of a common object, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it’s inconsistent, not a concern, but when this is an everyday thing and maybe even when it’s interrupting conversation, now that’s a sign of much more prominent word-finding difficulty that would warrant evaluation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Susceptibility to financial scams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something that we need to be really, really aware of, and unfortunately just gets more and more common, is susceptibility to financial scams,” said Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients with dementia are at increased risk, and scammers know that, so they tend to prey on older individuals in the middle of the afternoon,” added Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is shame involved with falling for a scam, but scammers are getting smarter and sneakier, making it easier and easier to fall for the trick, noted Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, if you have a loved one who falls for one of these scams, it’s worth inquiring about their cognitive state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia is common, but there are things you can do to reduce your risk or slow the progression of the disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy lifestyle habits &lt;a href="https://www.alzra.org/blog/ways-to-slow-the-progression-of-alzheimers-disease/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="can not only slow the progression" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696958dde4b00edae2a41576" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alzra.org/blog/ways-to-slow-the-progression-of-alzheimers-disease/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;can not only slow the progression&lt;/a&gt; of dementia but can also help prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, genetics put them at higher risk of developing dementia, but “even in people where there is a genetic component, there’s good evidence to say that all of the following still make an impact, and maybe make an even bigger impact,” Fleisher said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really, folks should follow the advice from their doctors when it comes to maintaining a healthy body — these habits also help maintain a healthy brain, according to Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most important things that I think about ... well, we should be screening for high blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar problems, and treating or addressing those problems when they exist,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should also prioritize a good night’s sleep, he said, and manage things like sleep apnea — “addressing that and treating that effectively can really improve brain health and brain function, and, I think, decrease the risk of dementia in the future,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then there’s the day-to-day things, good brain housekeeping things, we all know we should be doing,” Day said. This includes exercising, eating a nutritious diet with plenty of fruits and veggies, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alcohol-link-serious-illnesses_l_68c1c7ace4b0656225ce8563?origin=life-featured" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="limiting (or not drinking) alcohol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696958dde4b00edae2a41576" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="68c1c7ace4b0656225ce8563" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;limiting (or not drinking) alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and quitting smoking. It’s also helpful to spend time with other people, said Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can sometimes seem daunting. If you’re reading a long list of things and you’re not doing any of them, you don’t have to start doing them all immediately,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Take that small step forward ... introduce a 20-minute walk three times a week — you don’t have to start training for a marathon,” Day added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are positive steps towards brain health, and if the goal is to reduce the future risk of dementia, I think each of those steps matters and can be helpful for that,” Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there isn’t a cure for dementia, these changes can help people who are diagnosed, Fleisher noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to use everything at our disposal to slow down progression so people can live longer and live better and have better quality of life in that time,” Fleisher said. “There are countless examples of people living well with dementia. I think that stigma of getting this diagnosis and that being ‘the end,’ that is not where we are in 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with dementia are living rich, full lives because they’re empowered by knowledge and helpful health care teams, Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxOamdtMmNDT3hUa2NfRFd4NXBpVjM1dGJxWkdqbEthaGZCZkcyLVhMZG5uYzI5elNOSHRFM0pWN2pZNVFUVHlibFotYVBEb2hQczVnZmxtdW5lZFRTMmNKUVNDUlBRY0RhZy1pWms4OTNZdmhraDNvbzY2dEsyTWZIYUNTdkQyWEQxbmVxZjU5eGN1YjByQTNXWjRIWnNoZ9IBowFBVV95cUxPc1M3OTNpcFpyQTdzdnFyVHJJMFdZX09ONUVrNEJ3b2l3Rk9DRkFGaV94ZUFTWXdycjdtQW5vSHlhXy1TUmRNNTVLR0JDaVJnLTlpVU1pZGwtSncwX1ZUYWlfcUN0bjZQekVya3JUeE8zNVJaT1V5djdSOVJGMXF0NktqbWpsSXJfLVVPbVZ6azZuLWFvMHI5bm1vNFhoSk85OHZJ</guid></item><item><title>科学家将流感患者安置在健康人的房间里-没有人生病。为什么？ -女性健康</title><link>https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a70020637/healthy-people-flu-patients-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-n3hm4j et2g3wt7"&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="0" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.0"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.0.0"&gt;In a new study researchers had five people infected with the flu mingle with 11 people who didn’t have the virus in a hotel room with limited ventilation, but a high air recirculation rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.1"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.1.0"&gt;Ultimately, none of the healthy participants got sick, which could be due to the participants age (and natural immunity to the flu), among other factors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.2"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.2.0"&gt;Doctors say this suggests that keeping air circulating and wearing an N95 mask could be helpful in preventing the spread of the flu. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr data-node-id="1" class="css-18pb4rg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;One common piece of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevention/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="advice" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a69607196/flu-season-2025-2026-new-variant/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a69607196/flu-season-2025-2026-new-variant/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lowering your risk of the flu" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;lowering your risk of the flu&lt;/a&gt; is to avoid being around people who are obviously sick.

They also measured levels of the virus in the air and in the breath of the participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Ultimately, none of the healthy participants got sick.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-didnt-everyone-get-infected" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Why didn’t everyone get infected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;There are likely a few reasons for this. “Most people would find it shocking to realize that every time scientists have tried to put people in a room to see if infected people would infect uninfected people with the flu, it hasn’t worked,” Dr. Milton says. “It’s strange.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;His team guessed that this was because previous studies used lab viruses that circulated years ago (and that people had built up an immunity to), which is why they decided to use people who were naturally infected with current strains of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But Dr. Milton thinks one reason why the healthy participants didn’t get sick is that they were middle-aged adults who have had years of exposure to the flu. As a result, they may have more of a natural immunity than younger people, he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The study was also done during a milder flu year (2023-2024), aka not &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a69607196/flu-season-2025-2026-new-variant/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a69607196/flu-season-2025-2026-new-variant/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="this year" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Milton points out. While many of the study participants had high levels of the influenza virus in their nose, they didn’t cough. “In previous years, we saw that people who don’t cough don’t shed virus much,” he says. “Flu cases where people are coughing are the most contagious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Milton says the ventilation was “purposefully pretty bad,” with researchers sealing up doors and doing what they could to limit ventilation. But the air was also moving around the room a lot. “We wanted to have a well-mixed environment, thinking that would get everyone exposed,” he says. “It turned out that it worked the other way around. There was enough air in the room that when you had people who weren’t coughing much, everybody got exposed to a tiny amount of virus, which wasn’t enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="whats-the-takeaway-for-staying-well" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;What’s the takeaway for staying well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Doctors say there are a few things you can do with this information, whether you’re out in public or someone in your home is sick. Limiting coughing—by using cough suppressants or having the person who is sick wear a mask around others—can be helpful, according to &lt;a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3528/amesh-adalja" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3528/amesh-adalja" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amesh A.

Dr. Adalja agrees. “The better airflow is, the less likely that viral particles in the air land on another individual,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But one of the best ways to protect yourself is by wearing an N95 mask—especially if you’re around people who are coughing, Dr. Milton says. “Ultimately, all of these layers of protection work—that’s what this shows,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

Too often, patients were sent home with the same advice to eat better and exercise more, even when it clearly was not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There was a moment I put my face in my hands and thought, 'What am I doing?' I would write a lot of prescriptions for patients' diabetes, their blood pressure, their lipids and all these other conditions," says Perreault, a professor of endocrinology, metabolism and diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine who practices in Westminster alongside primary care physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She realized that many of those medications addressed symptoms rather than the root problem. "None of these people want to be on these medications and I thought if I could just help them with their weight, many of these health concerns would probably go away," she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That realization set the stage for a new approach that would soon reshape how weight care could work in primary care settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New System Called PATHWEIGH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perreault and her colleagues created PATHWEIGH, a structured process that helps patients and primary care teams focus directly on weight management. The program introduces dedicated clinic visits where providers can concentrate specifically on weight related care instead of squeezing it into a standard appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), PATHWEIGH was rolled out across UCHealth's 56 primary care clinics throughout Colorado to evaluate its impact. The pilot included 274,182 patients, making it one of the largest randomized trials ever conducted in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results published by Perreault and her team in Nature Medicine showed that the program reduced population weight gain by 0.58 kg over 18 months and shifted the overall trend from steady gain to weight loss -- an outcome with major implications for public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program also made patients more likely to receive help for weight issues. Participation increased the chances of receiving weight related care by 23%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With PATHWEIGH, we showed that we absolutely eliminated population weight gain across all of our primary care, which has never been done previously," Perreault says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, obesity specialists are now pointing to PATHWEIGH as a possible standard of care, and several health systems around the country are exploring how to adopt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a Clear Path to Weight Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perreault describes PATHWEIGH as a way to align patients and clinicians around a shared plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you think about weight loss medicine or surgery or a weight loss program, those are all vehicles to weight loss," she says. "We built a highway that we could put all the vehicles on, so there's actually a process for people to receive weight related care if they wanted it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process began with something simple. Clinics posted signs letting patients know they could request an appointment focused entirely on weight management by asking at the front desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That request automatically activated a workflow in the electronic health record. Patients received a survey, and once completed, their responses flowed directly into the clinician's notes. This allowed visits to focus less on background information and more on practical next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It made the whole process really efficient, and then effectively turned our note template into a menu of anything that we might do," Perreault says. "It really made it extremely time efficient and consolidated everything we might do for a patient into one interface."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removing Barriers and Awkward Conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data collected over 18 months showed that about one in four eligible patients received some form of weight related care at least once during the trial. Most of that care involved lifestyle counseling, but prescriptions for anti-obesity medications doubled during the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many one-size-fits-all weight loss programs, PATHWEIGH allowed treatment to be customized to each patient. It also reduced the discomfort that often surrounds conversations about weight in medical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most people who want or need weight related care never get it. Either they don't ask for it or the providers don't bring it up, and if they do, the patient usually gets told to go home and eat less and exercise more, and then nothing happens," Perreault says. "The person gets frustrated and they learn to not ask for help anymore, because it's kind of embarrassing and it doesn't help. This was a safe space to say, 'Hey, if you would like medical assistance with your weight, we actually have a process for you to receive that now.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Small Changes Matter at Scale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts estimate that rising obesity rates are driven by an average population weight gain of about .5kg per year. Stopping that increase and turning it into even modest weight loss could make a meaningful difference in slowing the obesity epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While it's not a significant difference on an individual patient level, it's a huge deal on a population and public health level," Perreault says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that patients who received clear weight related care through PATHWEIGH experienced greater weight loss. Even patients who did not receive direct interventions saw reduced weight gain compared with what would normally be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding Beyond Colorado&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perreault says the program's success has opened the door to wider adoption. Plans are underway to expand PATHWEIGH beyond Colorado. The Obesity Association, which is developing its first standards of care for obesity, is highlighting the program as a recommended care process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five health systems across seven states are also considering PATHWEIGH as its creators work toward licensing the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm really proud that PATHWEIGH was home-grown and built and tested here in Colorado," Perreault says. "This is the blueprint that moves us forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Why is it unique, I hear you ask? Because the rotational motion stimulates all three of the shoulder heads, known as the anterior, lateral and posterior deltoids. That means a well-rounded shoulder workout using just one move — great if you’re short on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-overhead-press-to-build-upper-body-strength-and-muscle" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-overhead-press-to-build-upper-body-strength-and-muscle"&gt;overhead presses &lt;/a&gt;develop your pushing power and improve core strength, as you must maintain a strong, tall torso position to press without using your legs for momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arnold press is also functional, mimicking the daily task of lifting an object overhead. This is a great weightlifting move for your shoulder stabilizers as well; the rotator cuff works to support and protect your shoulders during movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zHQmiGiexh78LdfvgP2yt" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zHQmiGiexh78LdfvgP2yt slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-forward-lean-bulgarian-split-squats" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-forward-lean-bulgarian-split-squats"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Forward lean Bulgarian split squats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="4cdb1a19-05aa-464c-a4fc-c4eafe501f85"&gt;Many argue the Bulgarian split squat is designed to be done with one weight, so you can decide whether you prefer using one or two dumbbells or kettlebells for this. The BSS is a glute-focused leg exercise that hits the gluteals, quads, hamstrings, calves and hips, while testing your balance and stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like to teach a slight forward lean to engage the glutes more; this means hinging at the hips and sending your chest over your thigh while maintaining a neutral spine and straight back. It shouldn't be excessive, just enough that you hit the working glute of the front leg a little bit harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love this exercise; it's simple yet very effective, and you just need a bench and a weight to do it. Even using your bodyweight is super efficient for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-sissy-squats" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-sissy-squats"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ff227339-b7d2-4c66-84a1-60bcdff92c75"&gt;The sissy squat is all about the core and quads. It was supposedly popularized by the bodybuilder Vince Gironda in the 1950s and 60s, and involves isolating the quads and driving over the toes to reach a deep knee flexion. It has been a part of old school bodybuilding and modern routines since. It's also quite fun to challenge your friends and family to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your lower-body joints are working hard, but otherwise, this squat variation is designed to take out a lot of the hip work and drive the movement through your quads, creating serious strength and growth. Unlike a regular squat, you'll be on your tiptoes, helping to activate your calves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must engage your core and move slowly and with control as your knees track forward; lean back to counterbalance yourself and focus solely on your form at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a wall or squat rack for support can help you gain confidence and depth. I strongly recommend a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/im-a-personal-trainer-improve-your-squats-and-runs-with-this-5-move-ankle-mobility-routine" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/im-a-personal-trainer-improve-your-squats-and-runs-with-this-5-move-ankle-mobility-routine"&gt;mobility routine&lt;/a&gt; that warms your muscles and joints properly before trying this, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-4-drag-curls" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-drag-curls"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Drag curls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="c2153676-5b74-4aab-b0b3-93aa64e88ea6"&gt;Drag curls work best with a barbell or EZ bar, but you can use dumbbells if you want. This exercise hits the biceps hard as you "drag" the bar up your body while keeping your elbows pulled back as you flex and extend. The weights should stay close to your body at all times as you focus on more of a vertical lift than the arc of a curl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the top, it creates a strong peak contraction and hits the long head of your biceps. Your shoulders have little to do, and you're maximizing &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/time-under-tension-what-is-it-and-could-it-help-you-grow-muscle" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/time-under-tension-what-is-it-and-could-it-help-you-grow-muscle"&gt;time under tension&lt;/a&gt; compared with regular&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/face-off/bicep-curls-vs-hammer-curls-which-is-best" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/face-off/bicep-curls-vs-hammer-curls-which-is-best"&gt; biceps curls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to stay controlled throughout and aim for a slow negative, which basically means slowing down the lowering motion compared with the lifting motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="21f0ff8b-e536-4f6e-8438-393cca54ad69"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell with an underhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pull your shoulders back and down, core engaged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows and begin pulling the weight up your body, driving your elbows backward and behind you&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When your arms are fully flexed (the bar should be roughly in line with your lower chest), pause and squeeze your biceps hard&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly lower the weight with control, keeping it vertical just like you did on the way up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5-pullovers" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-pullovers"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Pullovers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="3fafb434-db87-4283-8e9d-cb1a9fd7ced7"&gt;Pullovers are touted as a shoulder exercise, but they actually work the pecs, lats (wing-shaped muscles in your back which are large and powerful), triceps and anterior deltoids. They are also surprisingly effective for improving shoulder mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upper-body exercise uses strict movement, so keep your core engaged and try not to lift through your lower back; for advanced weightlifters, you might want to adopt a slight arch of your back as long as your core is switched on properly, but otherwise, your back should be supported by the bench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This takes control; as the dumbbell travels upward and lowers behind you, your range of motion increases because there's nothing but air behind the bench, which makes it harder to lift and pull back to the starting position. Only travel as far as you can control the weight and build slowly. You'll feel a deep stretch during the lower and plenty of resistance during the lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-edfc0896-0320-49b7-b55d-1d165f07ffac" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="sets-and-reps-3"&gt;Sets and reps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="7e896a7a-4030-4927-bc37-9c8870ca707e"&gt;Aim for 8-12 reps and 3-4 sets of each exercise. You can pluck whichever ones you like and add them to your existing workout plan or combine all five for a full-body workout.

Because siblings share genetics and family environment, this design helps separate the effects of the drug from family background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In sibling-comparison analyses, exposure to acetaminophen during pregnancy was not associated with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD or any other intellectual disability. This conclusion held up even in studies with more than five years of follow-up, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The authors said the review may help explain why earlier observational studies appeared to show a possible link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and developmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;People do not take acetaminophen randomly but for symptoms such as fever, infection, inflammation or pain, the authors said. These symptoms may also be linked to the brain development of a fetus, making it possible to confuse the effects of the underlying condition with effects of the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Jessica B. Steier, who leads the science communication group Unbiased Science and was not involved in the review, told ABC News that not treating symptoms, such as fever, could be harmful to both the pregnant person and the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Untreated fever has documented associations with serious pregnancy and fetal risks," she explained.

(WZTV) — &lt;/span&gt;A Spring Hill woman’s family and best friend are speaking out after they say she died during a histoplasmosis cluster in Middle Tennessee, which is raising concerns about delayed testing and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) has confirmed to FOX 17 News that it has identified 35 cases of histoplasmosis in Williamson and Maury counties as part of its investigation. TDH said a clear source of exposure has not been identified, which the department noted is not uncommon with histoplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Histoplasmosis is a lung infection caused by a fungus that can be found in soil. Symptoms can resemble pneumonia or other respiratory illnesses, including cough, chest pain, fever, chills, fatigue, and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alyssia Brown, of Spring Hill, Tennessee, pictured her alongside her roommate Kimberly Shelton and Shelton's kid, died Monday, Dec. 15, her family says.

They say histoplasmosis test results came back Thursday, Dec. 18, indicating, she was positive. (Photo courtesy Kimberly Shelton)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family of Alyssia Brown, who lived in Spring Hill with her roommate, says Brown developed a cough shortly after moving into the home in October. Her roommate and best friend, Kimberly Shelton, told FOX 17 News the cough lasted for weeks and did not seem alarming at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After we moved into this house in like October, she started developing a little bit of a cough, it really didn't seem like very much, it was just a cough that lasted for a long time,” Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown’s mother, Gwendolyn Brown, said she recognized the symptoms after seeing information about the histoplasmosis cluster online and reading it to her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She goes, ‘Mom, that’s literally every single symptom that I have,’” Gwendolyn Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family says Alyssia Brown went to the emergency room on Dec. 8 and was treated for bronchitis. They also say she was prescribed prednisone, a steroid medication, and they believe her condition worsened afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelton says when they returned for care a few days later, she repeatedly asked providers to test Brown for histoplasmosis after learning there was an alert about increased cases in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we went in, they didn’t even want to test her. I had to tell them like, ‘there’s this thing going around, can you please just test her for it?’” Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family says a histoplasmosis test was ordered on Saturday, Dec. 13. Brown died Monday, Dec. 15, they said. The family and roommate say the test results came back Thursday, Dec. 18, indicating she was positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelton said the loss has been devastating, and she doesn’t want anyone else to experience the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having to live my life without my best friend is beyond stupid, and I don’t want anybody else to have to go through this,” Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to FOX 17's questions, TDH said it cannot confirm the cause of death of individuals and does not speculate on the procedures of private healthcare providers. TDH said it shared information about the histoplasmosis cluster with area healthcare providers in a Tennessee Health Alert Network message on Dec. 3, 2025, which included information about clinical presentation, provider recommendations, and a laboratory testing timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TDH also said histoplasmosis is commonly found throughout soil in Tennessee, making it challenging to prevent exposure completely. The department said people with weakened immune systems, or those exposed to a large amount of spores, face a higher risk of severe infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce risk, TDH recommends avoiding outdoor activities that disturb soil and limiting contact with plant matter or bird and bat droppings. For higher-risk activities, such as cleaning chicken coops, exploring caves, or tearing down old buildings, TDH recommends wearing a protective N-95 mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown’s mother urged others to push for testing if they believe they may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ask for testing. Keep asking till you get it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown’s family says they are still waiting on official autopsy results, but they hope sharing her story encourages others to take persistent symptoms seriously and seek medical care if symptoms worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WTVC</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 00:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNQ0cwNmtfNW53bE9GdFpmTG5qaDlTMTBlZGdDajdYTGVkSHdXbGxsaTVjZDJjNXpxV2YyOWxpeDFpTzNkYThsd2NiY1pVYjd1Tk9Yczhsai15MWFmejZieDdOUDMwZGpzazhLVmpkaUVVNmJvdmtDVVNHVTRfZDE2bXJSb05udGlXWl80aUR1UVVaMVRtODFfWVlQSU5jNy1iODd2UnBVY0R0aEE</guid></item><item><title>Fibremaxxing ：摄入更多纤维的趋势具有令人惊讶的好处- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lze6n0e6mo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Is fibre the new protein?

"It feels like the messages around gut health are finally getting through to people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;As well as benefitting your gut, eating more fibrous food - like brown rice and jacket potatoes - has other benefits too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31809-9" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;People who have a higher fibre intake&lt;/a&gt; will live longer, have less cardiovascular disease, fewer cancers and are at a lower risk of conditions like diabetes," says Kevin Whelan, professor of Dietetics at King's College London.

&lt;p&gt;The common societal stigma that having a “big penis” automatically means amazing sex, “puts a lot of pressure...to perform and give their partner an out-of-this-world orgasm. These societal expectations often create performance anxiety, as many feel the need to live up to this ideal,” says DeSeta. “These expectations can increase their risk of sexual dysfunctions like erectile dysfunction or even lead them to avoid sex altogether.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to DeSeta, people with bigger penises often experience a mix of emotions about their anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On one hand, they feel pressure to live up to the societal expectations of impressive sexual performances, and on the other, they are worried about hurting their partner,” she explained. “This combination oftentimes leads to feelings of shame or being misunderstood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.emotionstherapycalgary.ca/psychologists-therapists" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="8010959" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Rod Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, a registered psychologist specializing in sex therapy and trauma recovery, says one of the more heartbreaking patterns he’s witnessed in therapy is how those with larger penis sizes have genuinely developed trauma from repeatedly causing their partners pain during sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I call it an empathic injury,” Mitchell said. “Every time your partner winces or says ‘wait, that hurts,’ you’re absorbing a micro-trauma.

&lt;p&gt;The common societal stigma that having a “big penis” automatically means amazing sex, “puts a lot of pressure...to perform and give their partner an out-of-this-world orgasm. These societal expectations often create performance anxiety, as many feel the need to live up to this ideal,” says DeSeta. “These expectations can increase their risk of sexual dysfunctions like erectile dysfunction or even lead them to avoid sex altogether.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to DeSeta, people with bigger penises often experience a mix of emotions about their anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On one hand, they feel pressure to live up to the societal expectations of impressive sexual performances, and on the other, they are worried about hurting their partner,” she explained. “This combination oftentimes leads to feelings of shame or being misunderstood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.emotionstherapycalgary.ca/psychologists-therapists" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="8010959" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Rod Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, a registered psychologist specializing in sex therapy and trauma recovery, says one of the more heartbreaking patterns he’s witnessed in therapy is how those with larger penis sizes have genuinely developed trauma from repeatedly causing their partners pain during sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I call it an empathic injury,” Mitchell said. “Every time your partner winces or says ‘wait, that hurts,’ you’re absorbing a micro-trauma. These men carry around the weight of having hurt someone they love, over and over, with their own body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitchell explained that what might look like performance anxiety is actually a trauma response — their nervous system trying to prevent harm. “Your body treats repeated sexual discomfort or pain as a threat,” he said. “Guilt rewires your brain to see intimacy as dangerous, then anxiety kicks in before sex even starts, triggering a stress response that redirects blood away from your genitals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others might finish in seconds because their bodies are trying to escape the threat.

Chan School of Public Health, found that using acetaminophen during pregnancy may increase children's autism and ADHD risk, and urged caution over "especially heavy or prolonged use".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Months earlier, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr had pledged to find out the cause of a steep rise in reported autism cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In a controversial speech in the Oval Office in September, the US president said doctors would be advised not to prescribe the pain reliever to pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then issued a letter to clinicians urging them to be cautious about the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, while also saying it was still the only drug approved for treating fevers during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-responds-evidence-possible-association-between-autism-and-acetaminophen-use-during-pregnancy" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;On its website&lt;/a&gt;, the FDA says "a causal relationship" between the drug and neurological conditions "has not been established". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Health officials in the UK have stressed that paracetamol remains the safest painkiller available to pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 00:13:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE81N0VVSTUyb0ZrY1p0RzUwdUlFZXRaNTNHY3dpaGxNWThMMXVuVDRrd0hFT3ZlS09xUm1pOExtalFmVy1Fb1NxbWNNMVdHV3pyOWVGUWFKSlpDQdIBX0FVX3lxTE83X09DYjFhaERxcGtvSVBPSkVRTzBGbS0zRjhuVmU5SEgwUGdKd1BLWDhoTUVmMUpxNl9aLXpKeTFXMUVXakFKMndwVVVDaFRNenZxZ2pHcnVpMXRUNnZB</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州麻疹病例激增至558例- Honolulu Star-Advertiser</title><link>https://www.staradvertiser.com/2026/01/16/breaking-news/measles-cases-in-south-carolina-explode-to-558/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Carolina reported nearly 250 new measles cases this week, official figures showed today, bringing the total of confirmed infections to 558 since October as the threat of a wider outbreak increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State epidemiologist Linda Bell said on Wednesday the risk to unprotected individuals, including those traveling to the outbreak area in the northwestern part of the state, was increasing. At least 531 people are in quarantine after being exposed to the virus, and another 85 people who are symptomatic are in isolation to keep from spreading the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is only a matter of time before a very severe or even fatal case occurs,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, noting that about one in every 1,000 measles cases results in death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adalja said the larger the outbreak grows, the more difficult it will be to bring under control, and the more offshoots it will start in other parts of South Carolina and in other states, as is already happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Carolina, Ohio and Washington State have all reported cases linked with travel to South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States is seeing a resurgence of measles. The Trump administration and Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr, an anti-vaccine activist, have made sweeping changes to the U.S. childhood vaccination schedule – moves that many experts say will increase vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the United States reported 2,242 confirmed measles cases, the most in three decades, putting the nation’s prized status of having eliminated local transmission of the disease at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Carolina’s outbreak, which began in October, is centered on Greenville and Spartanburg Counties along the state’s northern border with North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those infected, 483 were unvaccinated, six were partially vaccinated with one of the recommended two-dose measles-mumps-rubella vaccines, 13 were fully vaccinated and 56 had unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most cases were reported in children in the five to 17 age group, followed by those below five years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Carolina officials reported on Thursday two new measles cases related to the South Carolina outbreak, in Buncombe County, bringing that county’s total to five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Carolina has set up a measles dashboard, which lists a total of seven cases since December, and urged residents to make sure their children are up to date on all childhood immunizations, including the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can hang in the air for as long as two hours. It causes rash, cough and high fevers and can lead to severe complications including pneumonia, encephalitis and suppression of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Carolina’s outbreak follows a large outbreak in West Texas that started in January 2025 and infected more than 800 people in the state. Utah and Arizona are also battling outbreaks involving 201 cases in Utah and 223 in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-medical exemptions to school vaccine mandates have risen since the COVID-19 pandemic to an average of more than 3% of schoolchildren in 2023-24, compared with 0.6% in 2010-2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent measles, 95% of the population needs to be vaccinated. In some schools in South Carolina’s Spartanburg County, vaccination coverage is as low as 20%, Bell said this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stacy Ellis Matheson, public health director in North Carolina’s Buncombe County, said in a briefing this week that 87% of children in her county attend schools in which fewer than 95% of students are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got a fire raging in South Carolina, and these pockets of lower vaccination rates are kind of like tinder,” she said, adding there was the definite possibility of a wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;

(WZTV) — &lt;/span&gt;A Spring Hill woman’s family and best friend are speaking out after they say she died during a histoplasmosis cluster in Middle Tennessee, which is raising concerns about delayed testing and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) has confirmed to FOX 17 News that it has identified 35 cases of histoplasmosis in Williamson and Maury counties as part of its investigation. TDH said a clear source of exposure has not been identified, which the department noted is not uncommon with histoplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Histoplasmosis is a lung infection caused by a fungus that can be found in soil. Symptoms can resemble pneumonia or other respiratory illnesses, including cough, chest pain, fever, chills, fatigue, and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alyssia Brown, of Spring Hill, Tennessee, pictured her alongside her roommate Kimberly Shelton and Shelton's kid, died Monday, Dec. 15, her family says.

They say histoplasmosis test results came back Thursday, Dec. 18, indicating, she was positive. (Photo courtesy Kimberly Shelton)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family of Alyssia Brown, who lived in Spring Hill with her roommate, says Brown developed a cough shortly after moving into the home in October. Her roommate and best friend, Kimberly Shelton, told FOX 17 News the cough lasted for weeks and did not seem alarming at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After we moved into this house in like October, she started developing a little bit of a cough, it really didn't seem like very much, it was just a cough that lasted for a long time,” Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown’s mother, Gwendolyn Brown, said she recognized the symptoms after seeing information about the histoplasmosis cluster online and reading it to her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She goes, ‘Mom, that’s literally every single symptom that I have,’” Gwendolyn Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family says Alyssia Brown went to the emergency room on Dec. 8 and was treated for bronchitis. They also say she was prescribed prednisone, a steroid medication, and they believe her condition worsened afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelton says when they returned for care a few days later, she repeatedly asked providers to test Brown for histoplasmosis after learning there was an alert about increased cases in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we went in, they didn’t even want to test her. I had to tell them like, ‘there’s this thing going around, can you please just test her for it?’” Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family says a histoplasmosis test was ordered on Saturday, Dec. 13. Brown died Monday, Dec. 15, they said. The family and roommate say the test results came back Thursday, Dec. 18, indicating she was positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="YouTubeEmbed_youTubeEmbed__ygKv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelton said the loss has been devastating, and she doesn’t want anyone else to experience the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having to live my life without my best friend is beyond stupid, and I don’t want anybody else to have to go through this,” Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to FOX 17's questions, TDH said it cannot confirm the cause of death of individuals and does not speculate on the procedures of private healthcare providers. TDH said it shared information about the histoplasmosis cluster with area healthcare providers in a Tennessee Health Alert Network message on Dec. 3, 2025, which included information about clinical presentation, provider recommendations, and a laboratory testing timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TDH also said histoplasmosis is commonly found throughout soil in Tennessee, making it challenging to prevent exposure completely. The department said people with weakened immune systems, or those exposed to a large amount of spores, face a higher risk of severe infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce risk, TDH recommends avoiding outdoor activities that disturb soil and limiting contact with plant matter or bird and bat droppings. For higher-risk activities, such as cleaning chicken coops, exploring caves, or tearing down old buildings, TDH recommends wearing a protective N-95 mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown’s mother urged others to push for testing if they believe they may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ask for testing. Keep asking till you get it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown’s family says they are still waiting on official autopsy results, but they hope sharing her story encourages others to take persistent symptoms seriously and seek medical care if symptoms worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WZTV</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 23:39:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPRzVkMVFvTUEyMjBtMElvbjQ3X0lUdnRyeXBZdi0tQlcwUm5LX1VkSXJSLU9melFyMVN0dXJ5dkl0QjMtQXRLcVFrQ0RwMl9HU2xEdXB0Zl82dzFYTGtXQ2RwdGJkakRuQTBSQU5tU1l2eHdRY0l5LUVZMmtESEpwNVZFS0M1SU5jNjNrbXBsQ09DeGVETXR6NXRRR2JOM3A2TUE</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎疫情进入第七个年头，看不到尽头- Boing Boing</title><link>https://boingboing.net/2026/01/16/covid-pandemic-enters-seventh-year-with-no-end-in-sight.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;
					
&lt;p&gt;It's strange to think that the COVID-19 pandemic, which sent the world into lockdown seven years ago &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2025/03/18/snls-50th-celebration-sees-covid-19-spread-among-cast-and-guests.html"&gt;never ended&lt;/a&gt;. It continues to kill and cripple us, to this day. We simply stopped talking about it. Despite all the death and those forced to live their lives crippled by the after effects of the disease, the media (and I'm just as guilty of this as anyone at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times) and our governments decided to move on to new things—or at least ones that bleed in a sexy way that draws the eye. We—and I mean the world—didn't have enough ventilators or beds. Corpses floated down rivers in India. Bodies were stacked like sandbags in the back of freezer trucks as morgues overflowed. Doctors and nurses died in the same wards as the patients, days before, whom&lt;/em&gt; they had been struggling to save.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's hard to rekindle the fear and uncertainty I know I felt back then. I was worried sick for my little chosen family. I recall driving the parkways and ring road around Calgary, Canada, after dusk during the lockdown. Normally, the city, fast-growing and full of entitled drivers hungry to get home, was a sea of high-beam lights and road-stained metal. That evening, the roads were ours alone. For a moment, I thought it was funny that my phone shuffled to "Ghost Town" by the Specials. That moment passed quickly. It's so easy to forget the terrible things we survived when faced by new terrors that we don't yet know how to navigate. We don't much talk about it, but the &lt;a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2026/01/16/zjmv-j16.html"&gt;state of the pandemic right now&lt;/a&gt; is… well, not great.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…the United States facing the 12th major wave of infections. Conservative estimates place cumulative COVID deaths in the United States at over 1.2 million, while excess-mortality analyses indicate a substantially higher toll. Globally, excess-mortality modeling places the true pandemic death toll in the tens of millions, with central estimates near 27 million worldwide, far exceeding official counts. Transmission continues at high rates—presently at roughly 1 million infections per day, with more than 240 million infections recorded in 2025 alone. Reinfections are widespread, and Long COVID remains a mass disabling condition affecting millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I lie awake at night, and the intrusive thoughts in my rotation recede for long enough to hear other musings, I wonder how we can ever hope to take care of one another when we have so quickly been entirely convinced not take care of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previously:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;• &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2025/06/19/new-study-suggests-long-covid-is-now-most-common-childhood-chronic-health-problem.html"&gt;New study suggests Long COVID is now most common childhood chronic health problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;• &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2024/07/22/public-health-and-science-communicator-provides-terrific-primer-on-all-things-long-covid.html"&gt;A terrific primer on all things Long Covid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;• &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2024/02/06/new-study-reveals-that-almost-1-in-4-adults-in-the-united-states-who-had-covid-also-developed-long-covid-symptoms.html"&gt;New study reveals that almost 1 in 4 adults who had COVID also developed long COVID symptoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most are unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a06bbc" class="body-graf"&gt;No vaccine is 100% effective, but the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine comes close. Two doses, usually given around age 1 and then again around age 4, are 97% effective at preventing measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-744142" class="body-graf"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/map-kindergartner-vaccination-rates-are-lowest-rcna229455" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News data&lt;/a&gt;, the K-12 vaccination rate for MMR in Spartanburg County was 90% for the 2024-25 school year, below the 95% level doctors say is needed to protect against an outbreak. In neighboring Greenville County, the MMR vaccination rate was 90.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccdfb6" class="body-graf"&gt;Few people in the outbreak zone are taking advantage of free shots provided by the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-434bf0" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday and Thursday, the South Carolina Department of Public Health deployed mobile health units to Spartanburg offering free measles vaccinations. Just 18 people showed up to get the shots: nine adults and nine kids, state health officials told NBC News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ab4c70" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Eliza Varadi, a pediatrician in private practice in South Carolina, said the outbreak is centered around a community largely populated by people who immigrated from Ukraine to Spartanburg County within the past few decades. Many came to the U.S. with a level of vaccine distrust based on their experiences under Soviet control, said Varadi, who is originally from Russia. She hasn't treated patients in the current outbreak but provides care for many families from Russia and Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-76f8c2" class="body-graf"&gt;“I find myself constantly having to explain that, ‘yes, these vaccines are safe,’ and ‘no, they aren't going to cause harm,’” Varadi said. “It's a lot of re-educating with a lot of families coming from that area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-07ac85" class="body-graf"&gt;About an hour and a half south of Spartanburg, in Columbia, some families can’t get the shots quickly enough. “I’ve been getting phone calls from families saying, ‘I want that vaccine, like, yesterday. I want it early. What can I do?,’” Greenhouse said. During outbreaks, babies as young as 6 months can get the shot. They’ll still need the other two doses, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd5eca" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday, health officials said that someone visited the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia on Jan. 2 while they were infectious. NBC affiliate station &lt;a href="https://www.wistv.com/2026/01/14/live-update-sc-measles-outbreak-after-possible-exposure-columbia/" target="_blank"&gt;WIS reported&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 1,000 people visited the museum that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-166d58" class="body-graf"&gt;Anyone who is unvaccinated and exposed to the virus would need to quarantine for 21 days, the time it takes for symptoms to develop. There’s a work-around, however: Get the shot as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2d3a37" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we can identify that exposure within a short window, 72 hours, basically three days, we can give you an immunization, and your body will make its own defensive antibodies to protect you from this virus, and you can avoid quarantine,” LaCroix said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e6693" class="body-graf"&gt;Three other states have been affected by the South Carolina outbreak, including Ohio, where at least three children have been diagnosed, according to NBC affiliate station WKYC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c679b1" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dph.ncdhhs.gov/programs/epidemiology/communicable-disease/infectious-respiratory-diseases/measles-rubeola/measles-cases-and-outbreaks-north-carolina#DataNotes-11522" target="_blank"&gt;North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; has reported eight cases since December. Seven of those are linked to South Carolina, with five in Buncombe County, near Asheville. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-436d88" class="body-graf"&gt;This week, Washington state’s Snohomish County Health Department confirmed three measles cases in children who had direct contact with a family visiting from South Carolina over the holidays. The county’s health officer, Dr. James Lewis, said that while he hoped the outbreak would be contained, more diagnoses are likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6526d3" class="body-graf"&gt;“I really think there are cases out there in the community right now that are relatively mild, and people are managing at home,” Lewis said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e2d5f6" class="body-graf"&gt;The children in Snohomish County are all under age 10, Lewis said. None needed to be hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-882975" class="body-graf"&gt;Albrecht, of Prisma Health in South Carolina, said he and his colleagues in public health are greatly worried about additional spread.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-73e032" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“You should be, too,” he said. “We have right now, the largest outbreak in the U.S., and it’s going to get worse before it gets better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 22:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOa2pXX1RzZUgybWo1Z3Q0YmVUU3RhRXFIVjBHbnhGZWdZcVRzVVRxbU8xX1d4eExMZThONVFZTThKdDljdnZ1Z2ZtNjB3ZENhM1JBcnZLYjBuSVc1SG5MZTlEdVd0REQ0b3h1MUNIRjgxdzR2c1o2TFc5SWpYeUZCR1I0ME1Obmt4UXJKc2ZjdEJkMHJvZmdUWFJ0dDZxaG4tZ2UxSXpUeXlHM012Z01uaDgxMWR0NVRMUkE</guid></item><item><title>核磁共振扫描显示，即使在您“康复”之后，您的COVID-19也可能留下严重的脑损伤- ZME Science</title><link>https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/long-covid-damages-brain-after-recovery/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been very eager to shove COVID under the rug and pretend like 2020 never really happened. It’s totally understandable. But for the millions who still get the disease every year, that may not be an option. The infamous “Long COVID” has been linked to debilitating fatigue and brain fog that can disrupt people’s lives for months. To make things even worse, there’s also the skepticism of the medical world and society at large who find it hard to find proof of their pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, a groundbreaking new study from Griffith University in Australia just delivered that proof. In fact, even when people are completely recovered, their brains still look different.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using advanced multimodal MRI techniques, researchers have mapped the “invisible scars” left behind by the virus. virus. The results are a vindication for patients and a warning for the public: COVID-19 leaves a distinct fingerprint on the brain’s microstructure and chemical balance, even in people who believe they have fully recovered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-recovered-paradox"&gt;The “Recovered” Paradox&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From the start, COVID-19 was a medical oddity — a “respiratory” virus that can rob you of your smell, scramble your memory, or cause nausea and vomiting in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most unsettling long-term anomaly involved the “recovered” group. These are people who had COVID-19, got better, and currently report no symptoms. You’d expect their brains to look like those of the healthy controls who never caught the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But they don’t. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that recovered individuals (COVID-RHC) had altered tissue microstructure in the brainstem, cerebellum, and superior longitudinal fasciculus. The brainstem regulates vital functions like sleep and respiration, while the cerebellum handles coordination. This suggests that even a “mild” infection that you seemingly bounce back from may leave a latent neurological footprint—a silent echo of the virus that persists in the brain’s wiring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We used multimodal MRI techniques to examine both grey and white matter brain regions critical for memory, cognition and overall &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/toxoplasmosis-parasite-microglia-11082020/" data-wpil-monitor-id="3428"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; and found clear differences across all participant groups,” explains lead author, Dr Kiran Thapaliya. Overall, 47 participants (&lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/about-30-of-covid-patients-develop-long-covid-us-study-finds-19042022/" data-wpil-monitor-id="3427"&gt;Long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, Recovered, and Healthy Controls) underwent 3T MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="mlb2-103181833205712508" class="ml-form-embedContainer ml-subscribe-form ml-subscribe-form-103181833205712508"&gt;

                &lt;p class="zme-close-btn" title="Close"&gt;×&lt;/p&gt;

                

                

                &lt;div class="ml-form-successBody row-success"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="ml-form-successContent"&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;“The unique MRI approach identified significant alterations in brain neurochemicals, brain signal intensity, and tissue structure not only in individuals with Long COVID but also in those who considered themselves fully recovered,” he said. “The research also reported that altered brain tissue was associated with symptom severity in individuals with Long COVID, suggesting the virus may leave a silent, lasting effect on brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-myelin-mystery"&gt;The Myelin Mystery&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings offer vital insights into how COVID-19 affects the &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/genetic/gene-key-in-neuron-generation-discovered/" data-wpil-monitor-id="3425"&gt;central nervous system&lt;/a&gt; and may help explain some of the reported symptoms. But the mechanism isn’t entirely understood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Long COVID patients, the scans revealed something unexpected in the precentral gyrus (motor control) and middle temporal gyrus (memory/cognition).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These areas showed &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt; signal intensity in myelin mapping. Myelin is the protective sheath around neurons that allows for rapid signal transmission — think of it as the insulation on an electrical wire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While early post-mortem studies of severe COVID cases showed myelin loss, this study of living Long COVID patients suggests the opposite mechanism might be at play. People are recreating the myelin, but it comes at a cost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The evidence of remyelination suggests the body is attempting to heal even after the viral damage has passed. The persisetnce of this process in both &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/that-2022-hepatitis-outbreak-in-kids-it-was-apparently-covid/" data-wpil-monitor-id="3426"&gt;Long COVID&lt;/a&gt; and “recovered” patients suggests we should stop viewing COVID-19 as a simple respiratory illness. Instead, we should start respecting its long-term impact on the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper ‘Altered Brain Tissue Microstructure and Neurochemical Profiles in Long COVID and Recovered COVID-19 Individuals: A multimodal MRI Study’was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354625002005?via%3Dihub"&gt;Brain, Behavior, and Immunity – Health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Savage microbe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever was laying waste to his eye seemed to have come from inside his own body, carried in his bloodstream—possibly the same thing that could explain the liver mass, lung nodules, and brain lesions. There was one explanation that fit the condition perfectly: hypervirulent &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; or hvKP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical &lt;em&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; is a germ that dwells in people’s intestinal tracts and is one that’s familiar to doctors. It’s known for lurking in health care settings and infecting vulnerable patients, often causing pneumonia or urinary tract infections. But, hvKP is very different. In comparison, it’s a beefed-up bacteria with a rage complex. It was first identified in the 1980s in Taiwan—not for stalking weak patients in the hospital, but devastating healthy people in normal community settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An infection with hvKP—even in otherwise healthy people—is marked by metastatic infection. That is, the bacteria spread throughout the body, usually starting with the liver, where it creates a pus-filled abscess. Then it goes on a trip through the bloodstream, invading the lungs, brain, soft tissue, skin, and the eye (endogenous endophthalmitis). Putting it all together, the man had a completely typical clinical case of an hvKP infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, definitely identifying hvKP is tricky. Mucus from the man’s respiratory tract grew a species of &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella&lt;/em&gt;, but there is not yet a solid diagnostic test to differentiate hvKP from the classical variety. Just since 2024, researchers have worked out &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57379-4"&gt;a strategy&lt;/a&gt; of using the presence of &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/1/24-1516_article"&gt;five different virulence genes found on plasmids&lt;/a&gt; (relatively small, circular pieces of DNA, separate from chromosomal DNA, that can replicate on their own and be shared among bacteria.) But the method isn’t perfect—some classical &lt;em&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; can also carry the five genes.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another, much simpler method is the string test, in which clinicians basically test the goopy-ness of the bacteria—hvKP is known for being sticky. For this test, a clinician grows the bacteria into a colony on a petri dish then touches an inoculation loop to the colony and pulls up. If the string of attached goo stretches more than 5 mm off the petri dish, it’s considered positive for hvKP. But, this is (obviously) not a precise test.&lt;/p&gt;

	On Oct. 1, 2025, two prominent Danish vaccine researchers, Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn, faced potential career ruin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	A group of top Danish statisticians completed a&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X25012344" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; withering analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the duo’s research, which would be published in the international journal &lt;em&gt;Vaccine&lt;/em&gt; weeks later. The analysis documented “questionable research practices” and unspooled a veritable rap sheet of poor scientific practices. It followed a devastating &lt;a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/samfund/et-daarligt-immunforsvar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;series of articles&lt;/a&gt; in the weekly Danish newspaper &lt;em&gt;Weekendavisen,&lt;/em&gt; exposing how Aaby and Stabell Benn had allegedly oversold their research findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Aaby, 81, and Stabell Benn, 57, who are married, are best known for pioneering a theory that vaccine opponents have embraced: that vaccines have potentially unknown and nonspecific effects on the immune system, and while some vaccines that use weakened live viruses can reduce mortality, others using inactivated viruses can increase it. For decades, they’d studied this idea, using a research outpost in the impoverished West African nation of Guinea-Bissau. 

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In the painstaking world of scientific research, Aaby and Stabell Benn faced a significant obstacle after months of attack: How could they continue to fund their work if question marks hovered over their methods and their results?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	But just two days after the statisticians submitted their commentary to &lt;em&gt;Vaccine,&lt;/em&gt; the couple found a financial lifeline at the top level of the U.S. government’s scientific firmament. On Oct. 3, Stabell Benn was in confidential discussions with Health and Human Services officials handpicked by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to obtain exclusive research funding, according to &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/projects/223788-hep-b-study-emails/" target="_blank"&gt;previously unpublished emails obtained by &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Stabell Benn’s pitch: to run a randomized controlled trial in Guinea-Bissau that would give a birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine to half of the 14,000 newborn participants, but not to the other half, in order to study whether the birth dose had potentially negative health effects such as skin ailments or neurodevelopmental disorders. 



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Her well-timed inquiry was supposedly “unsolicited,” according to the emails. But it came just as Kennedy was weighing a controversial policy shift that he announced in mid-December: to no longer universally recommend hepatitis B vaccinations, including the birth dose, which is widely credited with virtually eliminating transmission of the disease from mothers to infants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Over the next three months, two of Kennedy’s most controversial appointees with a long history of anti-vaccine activities, &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/rfk-jr-appoints-longtime-anti-vaccine-ally-lyn/story?id=123213887" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Lyn Redwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ms.now/analysis/robert-f-kennedy-jr-vaccines-stuart-burns-hhs-rcna220029" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Stuart Burns&lt;/a&gt;, helped shepherd the no-bid grant for Stabell Benn and Aaby’s research through HHS’ bureaucratic maze, the emails show.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“This is a funding priority for CDC/HHS,” Burns, a senior adviser to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote to Stabell Benn on Nov. 14, as he looped in the director of the CDC’s Office of Grants Services. The email from Burns is marked “DRAFT, INTERNAL, DELIBERATIVE, NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION PREDECISIONAL.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Gunver Lystbæk Vestergård, a journalist for &lt;em&gt;Weekendavisen&lt;/em&gt;, provided &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; with the documents, after obtaining them through a freedom of information request to the University of Southern Denmark, where Stabell Benn is a professor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	On Dec. 18, two days after the CDC&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-hepatitis-b-immunization.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would no longer recommend hepatitis B vaccinations for all U.S. children, the $1.6 million Guinea-Bissau grant was&lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-23245.pdf?utm_campaign=pi+subscription+mailing+list&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=federalregister.gov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; quietly posted in the Federal Register&lt;/a&gt;. It was&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/19/hepatitis-b-vaccine-study-guinea-bissau-rfk#:~:text=In%20a%20recent%20survey%2C%20about,than%2010%2C%E2%80%9D%20Offit%20said." rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; swiftly denounced&lt;/a&gt; by global public-health experts as unethical for proposing to not provide a potentially lifesaving birth dose of the vaccine to half of the newborn study participants, in a nation where almost one-fifth of adults and more than one-tenth of children are infected with hepatitis B. Infants who contract the disease face steep odds: They have a 90 percent chance of developing chronic hepatitis B, and a quarter are likely to die from cirrhosis, liver cancer, and other outcomes — a fate more devastating in poor countries that lack advanced care.    



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The emails — though far from a complete picture — provide a window into the way that Kennedy and his handpicked allies are tossing aside longstanding review practices and working behind the scenes not only to steer grants to researchers they view as ideologically aligned, but also to fund studies they think may generate after-the-fact scientific justification for policy changes they appear determined to make. 

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Dr. Daniel Jernigan, the CDC’s former director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, who resigned from the agency last August, tells &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; that the Guinea-Bissau grant is “nowhere near where a study of this type should be both scientifically and ethically,” and he says the truncated process of its award, rather than standard practice, reflects Kennedy’s approach to science: “`Let’s start fishing and trolling to find evidence.’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/hepatitis-b-vaccines-study-africa-cancel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the ethical concerns led Africa CDC officials to reportedly halt the study, though Guinea-Bissau officials said that it can be resumed once it is redesigned. An HHS official who asked not to be named tells &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;, “It is our position the study will proceed as planned once the study protocols are finalized.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	An HHS spokesman, Andrew Nixon, defended the study, saying it is “designed to answer important questions about the broader health effects of the hepatitis B vaccine. This research aims to fill existing evidence gaps to help inform global hepatitis B vaccine policy and we will ensure the highest scientific and ethical standards are met.”    &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	He did not respond directly to detailed questions about whether the agency’s grant review process followed standard practices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Stabell Benn and Aaby did not respond to detailed questions from &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone,&lt;/em&gt; nor did the University of Southern Denmark, where they work. However, in &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christine-stabell-benn/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;previous public comments&lt;/a&gt;, they have vigorously defended their scientific findings, their integrity, and their hypothesis that vaccines have nonspecific effects that can impact mortality, and claim to have debunked the arguments leveled by their critics.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	DENMARK HAS EMERGED AS A NORTH STAR of sorts for the Trump administration. We seem to want what the Danes have, whether it’s the semiautonomous territory of Greenland or their slimmed-down vaccination schedule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	On Jan. 5, Kennedy announced that the CDC would no longer universally recommend six of 17 childhood vaccinations, portraying the more minimalist vaccination schedule as better aligning the U.S. with peer nations, particularly Denmark. The change was met with a storm of criticism by U.S. vaccine experts and blasted by the American Academy of Pediatrics as “dangerous and unnecessary.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Most Danish scientists were also baffled, pointing out that Denmark vaccinates against only 10 diseases, in part because it has a more comprehensive national health care system that can better screen for them. In fact, Denmark is an outlier, providing fewer vaccines than many other developed nations, including Germany and Japan. Kennedy’s real agenda is to “get rid of all the vaccines,” says Danish vaccine scientist Anders Hviid. “I think it’s a mistake to try and give him any other type of motive.” An HHS spokesman contested that characterization, saying, “Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine. He is focused on restoring public trust and informed consent.”    

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In August, Hviid was personally targeted by Kennedy, after publishing in the &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt; a comprehensive study of 1.2 million Danish children that found no link between aluminum in vaccines and chronic diseases, including autism. After Kennedy demanded the study be retracted, the journal refused.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	By contrast, Stabell Benn has celebrated Kennedy’s ascent, telling a Danish news program in November 2024 that he could serve as a “catalyst, to open the Pandora’s box that we don’t actually know everything worth knowing about vaccines.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In turn, Kennedy has long lionized Aaby and Stabell Benn’s research, talking it up to Joe Rogan on a 2024 podcast, and hailing Aaby as a “hero” in his 2023 book, &lt;em&gt;Vax-Unvax: Let the Science Speak.&lt;/em&gt; Last June, when Kennedy announced that the U.S. would no longer fund Gavi, a global alliance that buys vaccines for the world’s poorest children, he cited Aaby and Stabell Benn’s research to claim that Gavi had ignored a tenfold increase in female mortality caused by the DTP vaccine that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	But the bandied-about claim that the DTP vaccine increased the death rate in girls had sparked the outrage of a Danish physician and journalist, Charlotte Strøm, who began digging into its origin and would soon share her findings with Vestergård at the &lt;em&gt;Weekendavisen&lt;/em&gt; newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The initial claim had come from a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28188123/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt; in Guinea-Bissau, conducted by Aaby and Stabell Benn at their field research station, the Bandim Health Project. Because the study was observational and not a randomized clinical trial, it met a lower standard of evidence. In an updated &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X21007209?via%3Dihub" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers essentially walked back their initial finding, stating that they now found no increased mortality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Despite the crumbling evidence, Stabell Benn — like many of Kennedy’s supporters — repeatedly sounded the alarm that vaccines were inadequately studied and their potential dangers underexplored. Specifically, she criticized scientific and health organizations for never doing a randomized clinical trial — considered the gold standard for scientific evidence — of the DTP vaccine’s effects on girls, despite the warning signs that she and Aaby had documented in Guinea-Bissau. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	As Strøm hunted through clinical trials, she made a startling discovery. Aaby, himself, had conducted a randomized clinical trial of the DTP vaccine in Guinea-Bissau from 2005 to 2011 that had enrolled more than 6,000 children, but had never published the results.   

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	As Vestergård reported this out, Stabell Benn and Aaby produced a series of shifting explanations for their delayed publication. But the revelation that they had withheld data for close to 14 years broke as a true scientific scandal in Denmark. Vestergård realized she was on to a “bigger story about a hypothesis that is being oversold and a spinning of scientific results,” as she tells &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	When Stabell Benn finally did post partial results last March on &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/profile/in/christine-stabell-benn?trk=universal-search-cluster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;her LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, under pressure from the &lt;em&gt;Weekendavisen&lt;/em&gt; articles, she claimed that the data could neither support nor refute their theory of increased female mortality from the DTP vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	THOUGH PROOF REMAINED ELUSIVE, Aaby and Stabell Benn’s larger hypothesis — that vaccines produced as-yet-unknown effects in the body that required more, better, or different studies — had become a key pretext for Kennedy’s overhaul of U.S. vaccine policy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Emails reveal that Stabell Benn’s conversations with Kennedy’s associates tracked almost to the day with the administration’s controversial deliberations over whether to no longer recommend that every newborn get a hepatitis B birth dose.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;

			
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In early June, Kennedy removed all 17 members of the crucial Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which advises the CDC on what vaccinations to recommend, and replaced them with members more closely aligned with his views. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The new ACIP committee met for the first time on Sept. 18, in a meeting that “devolved into confusion and near chaos,” according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times,&lt;/em&gt; as the members deliberated over whether to stop universally recommending the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose. The vote was postponed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	But it appears that Stabell Benn had submitted her first funding request to HHS the day before, on Sept. 17, as referenced by a CDC official in a later email to Stabell Benn. In one email attachment, a copy of the trial protocol — which has since been &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/update-a-newly-revised-protocol-of" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;leaked online&lt;/a&gt; — is dated Sept. 18.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	On Sept. 19, the ACIP committee — mired in confusion on its second day of deliberations — disbanded without voting on whether to pull back the recommended hepatitis B birth dose. But HHS officials have argued — against strenuous medical input — that U.S. screening adequately detects hepatitis B infections in pregnant mothers, and while those newborns must get a birth dose and followup vaccinations, families should decide for themselves when no infection is detected.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	On Oct. 3, with her reputation under attack in Denmark, Stabell Benn sent a detailed email to HHS official Lyn Redwood, who had previously served as president of Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization founded by Kennedy. Appearing to resume a conversation by beginning her email with the words “Dear Lyn, Something else,” she confidently detailed the hepatitis B study proposal and wrote in bold, “Our biggest challenge is securing the funding.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	She explained that the Pershing Square Foundation — established by billionaire hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman — had pledged $1.8 million, provided they could raise the same amount within the month. “I would be grateful for any suggestions you may have on how to secure funding for this important trial.” (Foundation officials did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	It is not clear how Redwood responded. But in a Nov. 12 email, the director of the CDC’s Office of Grants Services advised Stabell Benn that HHS had forwarded her funding request to CDC, where “all unsolicited proposals are reviewed and evaluated for funding consideration by both the Office of Financial Resources and appropriate subject matter experts.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Two days later, on Nov. 14, Stabell Benn had emailed the CDC grant official and copied both Stuart Burns and three officials from Ackman’s foundation, “so we are all on the same page.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Stabell Benn also laid bare the logic of the trial, implicitly pointing to the ethical quagmire. “The Guinean government has decided to implement hepatitis B vaccine at birth, but it will only be implemented in 2027.” That would give them a year in which not giving the birth dose would still meet the Guinean government’s standard of care, she explained, writing, “The sooner we can get started, the better the trial.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In a little over an hour, Burns replied to Stabell Benn that her study was a “funding priority.”  An HHS official familiar with the events says that the agency was moving swiftly because the outside funder, Pershing Square Foundation, had set a deadline for the researchers to obtain matching funds.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In Denmark, vaccine researcher Anders Hviid gives little credence to the idea that Stabell Benn’s study was somehow unsolicited. Kennedy’s “fingerprints are all over it,” he says, pointing to the study’s stated objective to examine secondary outcomes such as eczema and neurological disorders. “It makes absolutely no sense to study associations between this vaccine and these outcomes,” except that’s what interests Kennedy.  

	&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Medical experts throughout the world have denounced the study for knowingly not providing a lifesaving intervention to one set of children. Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who has denounced the study as Kennedy’s “own Tuskegee experiment,” referencing the infamous U.S. medical study that withheld antibiotics to Black sharecroppers infected with syphilis, tells &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;, “Here is a resource-poor country where roughly 11 percent of children less than 18 months of age have hepatitis B. Enter &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/rfk-jr/" id="auto-tag_rfk-jr" data-tag="rfk-jr"&gt;RFK Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, who sees this as a golden opportunity to prove one of his theories.”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Meanwhile, most Danish doctors are continuing to follow the science. In 2024, all of the nation’s hepatitis B hospital units wrote to Danish health authorities, urging them to add hepatitis B vaccines to the vaccination schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
















&lt;/div&gt;		&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Rolling Stone</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 21:15:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPaUxEYXd1X2JoYzRmUGdzN2dVRTB2cENIOW1UOEhDZk1vbFJVVkVUdTJqWXV1R1lLdDZPZVJNUWVqZmpEbWVaOHlfV2owWU0tSG9LRl8yc3g1bXJSb1RDa01NSEQ2dDk4eFl6ei1TTjJvX1A5UmdTZ1BObTdyMktfakplckJQNk9DTzNaNG5FbTlLaEc0ZE9VbWV3U3JOZVJ4RU1aTg</guid></item><item><title>当地盖辛格医院产能高于“历史水平” - Scranton Times-Tribune</title><link>https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/2026/01/16/local-geisinger-hospitals-above-capacity-at-historic-levels/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geisinger officials grappling with packed emergency departments and inpatient units are imploring the public to consider the most appropriate points of care as the health system’s hospitals in Lackawanna and Luzerne counties operate above capacity at historic levels not seen even during the heights of the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a plea prompted by a recent surge in respiratory virus cases and an inrush of local patients picking Geisinger as their health care provider, including some switching health systems as Commonwealth Health’s hospitals, particularly those in Scranton, face uncertain futures amid a pending ownership change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against that backdrop, Geisinger Community Medical Center in Scranton, Geisinger South Wilkes-Barre in the Diamond City and Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center in Plains Twp. are caring for more patients now than during the pandemic’s peak, Geisinger officials said this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And one of the reasons why we are having this surge … is the respiratory virus, and at the same time we have more people choosing Geisinger because of the situation, the ground situation, in the other hospitals,” said Ujwal Tuladhar, M.D., a board-certified hospital medicine specialist who serves as associate chief medical officer of Geisinger Community Medical Center. “It’s a combination of both, but at the current moment it’s more of the respiratory virus, though more patients coming to Geisinger because of the Commonwealth situation has exacerbated it further.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-v59fwex4" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_v59fwex4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We thought COVID times were high, but this is way, way above what we had at that time,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The respiratory virus activity Tuladhar referenced includes influenza, RSV and COVID-19, with a mutated strain of flu called subclade K driving a surge in flu cases health officials here and elsewhere have highlighted in recent weeks. And while the &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/health/diseases-conditions/infectious-disease/respiratory-viruses/respiratory-virus-dashboard"&gt;Pennsylvania Department of Health’s respiratory virus dashboard&lt;/a&gt; showed statewide flu activity “decreasing rapidly” during its most recent weekly update — the next update is Tuesday — it also cautioned that flu activity may increase again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statewide RSV and COVID-19 activity was “decreasing slightly” and “stable,” respectively, according to the online dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three of the aforementioned Geisinger hospitals — GCMC, GWV and South Wilkes-Barre — were operating above 100% capacity when Tuladhar outlined the situations there in a Wednesday interview. That was still the case at GCMC and South Wilkes-Barre as of Friday morning, when GWV was at about 95% capacity, Geisinger spokesman Matt Mattei said.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“But our clinical leaders think that is an outlier,” Mattei said of the dip at GWV. “This trend has been pretty consistent since the beginning of the year, so we don’t know what tomorrow brings. I don’t think there’s any way to tell that that’s a good sign yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kali Gargone, a registered nurse who works in the surgical department at GCMC and serves as membership chair of the Northeast Pennsylvania Nurses Association, the local union representing nurses there, also spoke to the capacity challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been operating at high capacities since COVID,” she said. “Recently, I mean you go into the ER and there’s patients lining the hallway. Every open space has turned into a patient-care area. We are very overwhelmed. Not only is it flu season for the community, it’s also flu season for the staff that live in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressures Gargone and Geisinger officials described aren’t limited to emergency care.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“Not only just for our regular (medical-surgical) beds, but particularly for our higher level of care beds, our ICU and our stepdown beds, are at 100% capacity almost every day if not every day, so there’s always a patient shuffle,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capacity crunch underscores the importance of seeking care in the proper settings, be it via telehealth or at a primary care provider’s office, walk-in clinic or hospital emergency department, to avoid adding unnecessary strain to a system already bursting at the seams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We really need our community … to go to the most appropriate location for their care, and within Geisinger there are different levels of care that are available,” Tuladhar said. “If you have, say, mild to moderate respiratory virus symptoms and you think you can be treated at home with rest and hydration and over-the-counter medication, please stay home. Now, we request that you only come to the emergency (department) if you feel this is really severe and it’s life threatening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geisinger provided information on where and under what circumstances patients should pursue care depending on the severity of their symptoms and conditions. While those with mild symptoms from flu or other viruses can generally treat them at home with rest, fluids and medicine like acetaminophen and ibuprofen to manage pain and fever, people who need to see a clinician because of flu symptoms should start with their primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Geisinger PCPs sometimes have same-day appointments available by calling primary care offices early in the day,” the system noted. “Geisinger patients can call 800-275-6401 and say ‘schedule an appointment for primary care’ or use MyChart to find the direct line for their primary care clinic in their appointment reminders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urgent care locations can also treat less-serious illnesses and injuries “faster than providers can in the hospital setting,” per Geisinger, whose ConvenientCare clinics accept walk-in and scheduled patients. They’re “ideal for urgent treatment of respiratory viruses and other seasonal illnesses, allergies, skin rashes, sprains and strains, tick removal and ear, throat and urinary infections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients can reserve spots and check wait times at ConvenientCare clinics by visiting geisinger.org and clicking the “&lt;a href="https://www.geisinger.org/patient-care/find-a-location/urgent-care-wait-times"&gt;ConvenientCare&lt;/a&gt;” link under the “Find Care” tab at the top of the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geisinger also operates ConvenientCare+ locations at the Geisinger South Wilkes-Barre hospital campus and at its Geisinger Tunkhannock facility in Wyoming County, offering “more advanced treatment for non-life-threatening emergencies, such as nebulizer treatment for breathing issues, IV fluids and IV medications.” Those more advanced treatments complement the same services provided at traditional ConvenientCare clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A virtual urgent care option is also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presenting at the wrong point of care — a hospital emergency department for mild flu symptoms, for example — when another, more-suitable location would suffice can compound strain on the system and make for a frustrating visit, with longer wait times likely for patients with less-serious conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also create “a delay in taking care of those patients that actually need it, especially patients with strokes, heart attacks or acute respiratory illnesses that need to be addressed immediately,” Tuladhar said. “We do a pretty good job of trying to triage and trying to address the serious ones first, but when you have so many of those patients out there having to triage it does take away a lot of time addressing those patients that need more intense therapy and immediate care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Getting care in the right setting can help the people in our community, and of course it can relieve some pressure on our over-stressed local hospitals,” he said in closing. “I cannot stress this enough.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A new study led by researchers from the University of Bath in the UK suggests a standard unit for measuring cannabis potency, similar to how we quantify alcohol consumption with standard drinks, could help people manage their intake and identify those at risk of cannabis use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more countries &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/smoking-cannabis-may-not-be-as-harmless-as-you-think-heres-why"&gt;introduce laws&lt;/a&gt; allowing for medicinal and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/australia-s-capital-just-legalised-recreational-marijuana-in-defiance-of-federal-laws"&gt;recreational cannabis use&lt;/a&gt;, such standard measures could help inform public health strategies around harm reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As cannabis becomes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-reveals-a-major-surprise-about-medical-cannabis"&gt;increasingly available&lt;/a&gt; in legal markets around the world, it is more important than ever to help consumers make informed choices about their use," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1111637"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; senior author Tom Freeman, Director of the Addiction and Mental Health Group at the University of Bath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-reveals-a-major-surprise-about-medical-cannabis"&gt;Giant Study Reveals a Major Surprise About Medical Cannabis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people limit their enjoyment to a leisurely toke once in a while, others can develop &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/health-effects/cannabis-use-disorder.html"&gt;cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt; (CUD), which can lead to dependence, poor mental health, tolerance, risky behaviors, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/largest-study-yet-on-cannabis-and-brain-function-finds-a-worrying-link"&gt;impaired brain function&lt;/a&gt;, and problems maintaining relationships and finances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it stands, it's difficult for cannabis users and clinicians alike to quantify cannabis use, since the product has been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/us-to-reclassify-cannabis-in-dramatic-shift-in-drug-policy-heres-why"&gt;illegal and its production unregulated&lt;/a&gt; for so long (and in most parts of the world, still is).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know frequency and quantity of use can predict risk of cannabis disorder, but this doesn't account for the potency of the active ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cannabis potency (percentage of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) has been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cannabis-really-has-changed-significantly-since-todays-parents-were-teens"&gt;increasing for several decades&lt;/a&gt; and use of high potency cannabis is associated with an increased risk of negative outcomes, including CUD and adverse mental health," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.70263"&gt;the researchers write in their published paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewing data from 150 London-based adult and teen cannabis users collected across a period of 12 months as part of the four-year &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811221108956"&gt;CannTeen&lt;/a&gt; study, the team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-024-01806-y"&gt;estimated the drug's potency&lt;/a&gt; as standard THC units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, not all joints are created equal. For instance, a 0.45 gram joint of strong herbal cannabis might contain 12.78 standard THC units, while a weaker, seeded herbal cannabis can contain just 3.78 THC units, according to the new estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have made &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.14842"&gt;similar attempts&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.03.010"&gt;quantify cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; beyond weight and frequency/duration of use. This study goes a step further, expanding on the team's previous analysis and finding that measuring usage in standard THC units can effectively evaluate people's risk of developing cannabis use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's authors found that to reduce the risk of developing cannabis use disorder, adults should not exceed 8 THC units per week. Seventy percent of the adults who exceeded this limit in the CannTeen study reported cannabis use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ultimate goal of our new guidelines is to reduce harm," &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/like-alcohol-units-but-for-cannabis-experts-define-safer-limits/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; lead author Rachel Lees Thorne, a psychology researcher from the University of Bath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only truly safe level of cannabis use is no use. However, for those who don't want to stop or are unable to, we still want to make it easier for them to lower their risk of harm. For instance, a person might opt to use lower-THC products or reduce the quantity of cannabis they use."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-paper-proposing-thresholds-for-cannabis-use-as-published-in-addiction/"&gt;welcomed the findings&lt;/a&gt;, saying a standardized measure of THC consumption could be a useful tool that would empower patients to moderate their intake and aid research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychiatrist Marta Di Forti of King's College London notes, however, that "cannabis, unlike alcohol, does not contain only one active ingredient but over 144 cannabinoids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nevertheless, THC units are, undoubtably a very important and much-needed start," she &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-paper-proposing-thresholds-for-cannabis-use-as-published-in-addiction/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.70263"&gt;Addiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;South Carolina on Friday reported 124 new measles cases in the last three days, bringing the total number to 558 in the state's fast-growing outbreak. Cases have nearly doubled in the last week alone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have right now the largest outbreak in the U.S., and it's going to get worse before it gets better," &lt;a href="https://doctors.prismahealth.org/provider/helmut-albrecht/993846" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Helmut Albrecht,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease physician with Prisma Health and the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, said in a briefing Friday. Hundreds of people in other parts of the state are already in quarantine or isolation, he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The epicenter&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/14/nx-s1-5640860/measles-cases-spike-in-south-carolina" target="_blank"&gt; is in Spartanburg County&lt;/a&gt;, in the northwest part of the state.&lt;br&gt;The area has also seen a jump in students with nonmedical exemptions to required school vaccines since the pandemic. New research published this week &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2843870" target="_blank"&gt;in the journal JAMA&lt;/a&gt; finds these exemptions are growing in counties across the U.S. — making them vulnerable to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And concerns are growing that infections are spreading beyond the county. There have already been&lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2026/01/15/additional-measles-cases-north-carolina-ncdhhs-shares-new-measles-dashboard" target="_blank"&gt; six cases &lt;/a&gt;in neighboring North Carolina linked to the Spartanburg outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have lost our ability to contain this with the immunity that we have," Albrecht said, urging people to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vaccination rate among students in Spartanburg County is 90% overall, which is lower than the 95% threshold needed to prevent measles. Measles is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease" target="_blank"&gt;most contagious diseases.&lt;/a&gt; A single case can infect up to 18 other people on average.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt; A fast-spreading outbreak&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The South Carolina outbreak started in October, and has exploded in the last couple of weeks, with 248 new cases reported this week alone. Most are kids and teens who have not been vaccinated. Hundreds of children have been quarantined since it began, and exposures are happening in lots of public places, state epidemiologist Linda Bell said in a media briefing earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The settings of potential public exposures that have been newly identified in the last week include churches, restaurants, business, and many health care settings," Bell said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Bell warned that anyone who has not been vaccinated is vulnerable to infection.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Falling vaccination rates, rising exemptions&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While 90% of students in Spartanburg County meet school vaccination requirements, if you dig deeper, you'll find pockets with much lower vaccination rates. Bell said one school has a vaccination rate as low as 20%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Spartanburg County also has a relatively high number of nonmedical exemptions from vaccines — about 8% of students have such an exemption, a jump from just 3% in 2020, according to data published alongside the new research in JAMA. These are parents opting out of the required school vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tim Smith's wife is an assistant teacher in Spartanburg County who despite being vaccinated, caught measles from one of her students and got so sick she had to go to the hospital. Smith told the district school board this week that exemptions in Spartanburg have gotten out of control.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's absolute insanity," Smith said. "She was totally dehydrated. We have laws on our books that require vaccinations. For some reason, somebody decided that you can apply for a religious exemption and anyone that applies for this can get it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And it's not just religious exemptions; &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/state-non-medical-exemptions-from-school-immunization-requirements#:~:text=All%2050%20states%20and%20Washington,school%20vaccine%20requirements%20and%20exemptions" target="_blank"&gt;most states&lt;/a&gt; allow parents to get some form of nonmedical exemption to school vaccination requirements, either for philosophical or personal reasons or religious ones.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A growing trend nationwide&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new JAMA study found the rate of nonmedical exemptions has risen steadily in the majority of U.S. counties, and this trend has accelerated since the pandemic. The researchers examined exemption data from more than 3,000 U.S. counties and jurisdictions in 45 states plus the District of Columbia from 2010 to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In most states, even if the overall vaccination rate is high, there are pockets with higher rates of these nonmedical exemptions, says &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/nathan-lo" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nathan Lo,&lt;/a&gt; a physician-scientist with Stanford University and one of the study's authors.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"When you think about infectious disease outbreaks, it only takes a really small pocket of under-vaccinated individuals to create and sustain an outbreak," Lo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Higher exemptions tend to go hand in hand with lower vaccination rates, and there are a lot of communities vulnerable to potential outbreaks, says &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/michael-t-osterholdm-phd-mph" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Osterholm&lt;/a&gt;, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. He says all they need is one spark to ignite it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are a lot more South Carolinas waiting to happen," he says.&lt;/p&gt;

We appreciate the understanding while we work together to protect one another.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The updated guidance and safety precautions apply:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;· DO NOT visit if you are ill or have any signs and symptoms of respiratory illness including cough, runny nose, fever, sore throat, muscle aches or fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Children age 12 and under should not visit inpatients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· People with compromised immune systems or pulmonary complications should visit only if absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Masks are available at hospital entrances for all who wish to wear one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Visitors should wash their hands or use hand sanitizer prior to entering a patient room and prior to leaving the facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Compassionate exceptions to these restrictions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Salina Post</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 20:41:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5tMG9FU05hZVVXLXZycnQ1c0pZcU9GSG1iTm9nU1Jma2ZHbW45Ui10VTBZZ1RMNFpaN1pxZlZRZ0JISnFjZXJ3YTJST0pEM0xRckFHenhIWVdXTmhvcHVldWxuZjJnd2NQdkQzNm8xbUZfTXc</guid></item><item><title>克利夫兰急诊室摊牌：克利夫兰诊所与创伤中心计划引发医疗斗争- Cleveland.com</title><link>https://www.cleveland.com/news/2026/01/clevelands-er-showdown-cleveland-clinic-sparks-healthcare-battle-with-trauma-center-plan.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EZPVVH7EXNBRVITIQEH5U7YS3Y"&gt;What would be so bad about having three top tier hospital systems in Cleveland having tier 1 trauma centers to treat the most pressing emergencies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BFNLCADFC5GSFCQWKNAYOHJEZU"&gt;That’s what Today in Ohio hosts were asking Friday after the &lt;a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2026/01/cleveland-clinic-level-1-trauma-center-plan-draws-swift-criticism-from-metrohealth.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2026/01/cleveland-clinic-level-1-trauma-center-plan-draws-swift-criticism-from-metrohealth.html"&gt;Cleveland Clinic announced plans to open its own center amid harsh criticism by MetroHealth. &lt;/a&gt;Both MetroHealth and University Hospitals already operate tier 1 centers, and MetroHealth says adding a third will actually harm patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LY5CNCND5NEE7BT334E2BYMMEI"&gt;“MetroHealth is like, ‘wait a minute.’ They’re asking the Cleveland Clinic to reevaluate,” said Lisa Garvin. “They say that Greater Cleveland cannot support three level 1 trauma centers. It will harm patient outcomes and increase costs.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DHLQIEICEBF37BLI43BOPCBO2U"&gt;For those who aren’t familiar, trauma centers, handle the most severe, life-threatening injuries - traumatic brain injuries, serious falls, car crashes, gunshot wounds and blunt force trauma. Level 1 centers provide the highest level of surgical care to trauma patients, with specially trained teams available 24 hours day, seven days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W4XS5RANOFHPLCBF2MFQWIAAW4"&gt;The Clinic’s announcement seems to have reignited old rivalries and raised questions about the future of emergency care in Northeast Ohio. Chris Quinn said the situation is remarkably similar to when University Hospitals opened its trauma 1 center 11 years ago, fierce criticism from MetroHealth, which at the time had the only such center in Northeast Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="76CZAOCRQFGPBEZQQ74TKRDEEY"&gt;“MetroHealth was alone... And then, UH stood up and said we’re going to do it. And MetroHealth got very upset,” Quinn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="INPPVN6HSVGQBJW6K3D2AHECL4"&gt;The Clinic’s center would be at its main campus, a few blocks from the UH center. The Clinic’s announcement comes with ambitious plans, including possible expansion of their main campus emergency center and hiring trauma specialists. Garvin said a chief goal is erasing the need to transfer critical patients outside of they system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BAUHQZOJXFCPJCEX5FHRFGIDVM"&gt;Quinn challenged the opposition’s logic: “I just don’t see how Cleveland is ill served by having three great hospital systems all ready to treat you when you are at your worst.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CMIVGAGLAZEBJBU7ARLFMP3SXE"&gt;Quinn speculated that a chief goal of the Clinic involved pride. While the Clinic is internationally renowned and ranks high in U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report health system rankings, it never it first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="35J5E3HBXBDUBLOZ6IZL5ZAUMQ"&gt;“The top three hospitals in the U.S. News and World Report list, the ones that always beat the Clinic, all have trauma 1 centers. And if you want to top that list, you probably need a trauma 1 center,” Quinn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3IRWMFQ36FAYPLT7Y7IU7EO7ZU"&gt;Another consideration is emergency preparedness for the region. As Quinn pointed out, “If we ever had a cataclysmic event, a mass shooting, a plane crash or something, I think we’d be really glad to have three centers that could take the patients and spread the rapid treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="U2IUHTSSIVGZ3HZMIGMHL5FRP4"&gt;The Cleveland Clinic’s application process is just beginning, and so is the debate.

													644. IN TIME FOR NEWS TO GO, WE HAVE     A LOOK AT TODAY’S TOP NEWS STORIES ALONG WITH YOUR TRAFFIC AND WEATHER, ALL BEFORE YOU HEAD OUT THE DOOR. WE BEGIN WITH BREAKING NEWS OUT OF OCONEE COUNTY. ISABELLE MARKS AT THE OCONEE COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT CENTER. ISABELLE. WHAT DO WE KNOW SO FAR? HEY, ERIN, WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR IS THAT OFFICIALS ARE INVESTIGATING A HOMICIDE AFTER A WIFE AND HUSBAND WERE FOUND DEAD IN THEIR HOME OVERNIGHT. NOW, THERE’S LIMITED DETAILS SINCE THIS IS STILL PRETTY EARLY ON IN THE INVESTIGATION. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW SO FAR IS THAT THE COUNTY CORONER SAYS THAT THEY RECEIVED A CALL AROUND 9:00 LAST NIGHT AND REPORT THAT THE COUPLE WAS FOUND DEAD IN THEIR HOME ON CROMER MOOR DRIVE, NEAR WESTMINSTER. THE 911 CALL WAS PLACED BY A FAMILY MEMBER WHO WAS CHECKING IN AFTER NOT BEING ABLE TO REACH THEM, AND THE CORONER’S OFFICE SAYS THE DEATHS ARE BEING INVESTIGATED AS A HOMICIDE. THE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS 76 YEAR OLD LARRY MOORE AND HIS WIFE, 75 YEAR OLD SANDRA MOORE. WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL DETAILS RIGHT NOW. WE DON’T KNOW IF THERE’S A SUSPECT INVOLVED. WE ALSO DON’T KNOW THEIR CAUSE OF DEATH JUST YET. WE’LL CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU UPDATED, BOTH ON AIR AND ONLINE, AS WE CONTINUE TO LEARN MORE, BUT FOR NOW, REPORTING LIVE IN OCONEE COUNTY.

Of those infected, here is the vaccination status: 483 unvaccinated, 6 partially vaccinated with one of the recommended two-dose MMR sequence, 13 vaccinated, and 56 unknown. The incubation period for measles is usually 7 to 14 days but can be up to 21 days. People should monitor for measles symptoms for 21 days after exposure. Symptoms of measles include cough, runny nose, red watery eyes, and fever followed by a rash two to three days later that starts on the face then spreads to the rest of the body.  The MMR vaccine is safe and is the best way to protect against the virus.  Vaccination now can avoid long quarantines at home for those exposed to the measles virus. Vaccination within 72 hours of exposure can prevent measles infections. Vaccines are available at many primary care provider offices and pharmacies, as well as DPH Health Departments.

&lt;h2 class="body-h2" id="quick-facts"&gt;Quick Facts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;124 new cases since Tuesday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are currently 531 people in quarantine and 85 in isolation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of those infected, here is the vaccination status: 483 unvaccinated, 6 partially vaccinated with one of the recommended two-dose MMR sequence, 13 vaccinated, and 56 unknown.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak remains centered around Spartanburg County, with most cases located there, although a number of cases have been reported elsewhere such as &lt;a href="https://www.wyff4.com/article/measles-confirmed-greenville-county-school-crestview/70012173" target="_blank"&gt;Greenville County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.wyff4.com/article/measles-spreads-to-anderson-county-school-outbreak/70014851" target="_blank"&gt;Anderson County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wyff4.com/article/measles-spreads-to-anderson-county-school-outbreak/70014851" target="_blank"&gt;western North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the latest information from the South Carolina Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;124 new cases since Tuesday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are currently 531 people in quarantine and 85 in isolation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of those infected, here is the vaccination status: 483 unvaccinated, 6 partially vaccinated with one of the recommended two-dose MMR sequence, 13 vaccinated, and 56 unknown. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The incubation period for measles is usually 7 to 14 days but can be up to 21 days. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People should monitor for measles symptoms for 21 days after exposure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Symptoms of measles include cough, runny nose, red watery eyes, and fever followed by a rash two to three days later that starts on the face then spreads to the rest of the body. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The MMR vaccine is safe and is the best way to protect against the virus.  Vaccination now can avoid long quarantines at home for those exposed to the measles virus. Vaccination within 72 hours of exposure can prevent measles infections. Vaccines are available at many primary care provider offices and pharmacies, as well as &lt;a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=u001.vYOEavOnxV2T5raErnqLQJAkGFKecHUg5p47VuEuKxUWTmLT-2BhO5pMXE7-2BCyZzaeC0-2FeS4dkstFKRZgQL5jNNQ-3D-3Dcspj_uG4mCQLB9tukhJpN14mws0ZhzFFBDUdd-2F-2FjqRD3zCPIc6VZItOYVEpPELxBBVI52kOOmJaIcGXtH7I9-2FhWWSgULgs1Xa9kbc-2BoQp-2FBjHt8H57hXzUR6KmHQBwnAC58jzJ2Bgo2zYUTmE2iXUQNLM1RmdApelbs0yTc8S5s4Kx5i7E4cVZQpvu2Cs0-2BHOl5pO93Pd00DcxDWUlqJcBg4LC97qt3JTs0xJiPU5gEJHSHFp9wQOyLCdIRnV13gDJ9aQqWFM31INTue6nBsAi47UY1-2BfE37Ca6TVeAM06aTRz5GJZufUyJbbo1JaTUoa0s2wsQyWj5xnhX3FH1-2Fu3p0ccYkJXJhXe-2BhsAX6wPEWDG4p-2Flwzo-2BiB1ZHaP46tVUrup" rel="nofollow"&gt;DPH Health Departments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Fifteen more children died from the flu in the week ending Jan. 10, bringing the total of pediatric deaths to 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d2a277" class="body-graf"&gt;On Friday, the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an over 18% &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2026-week-01.html" target="_blank"&gt;drop in confirmed flu cases&lt;/a&gt;, compared to the previous week. Doctor visits for respiratory illnesses also decreased by more than 5% and hospitalization rates went down by nearly 55%. Influenza deaths rose by 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b30313" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC estimates that so far this season, 18 million people have had the flu, including 230,000 who were hospitalized and 9,300 who have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4f576" class="body-graf"&gt;“It seems like there is some cautious good news that cases are declining,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Island. “But I’m going to put a giant asterisk on this because that does not mean the worst is behind us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-edf672" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, flu cases dipped around this time before hitting a second peak in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-cases-high-cdc-illness-hospitalizations-rcna191203" target="_blank"&gt;early February&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-08a22c" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC data also captures the national trend, and it's likely some states have not yet seen influenza cases peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-806e73" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are not going to all experience this at the same time,” said Beth Carlton, a professor of public health at the Colorado School of Public Health at the University of Colorado in Aurora. “Nationwide, the trend is going down, but there may be differences in different states and communities as this virus runs its course.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3996e8" class="body-graf"&gt;While influenza tends to show up first in highly populated areas, such as New York City, and then hit rural areas later in the season, “the challenge with flu is that it is incredibly nimble, so it does not always behave the way we expect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2d7d24" class="body-graf"&gt;Cases may be dipping, but flu and other winter illnesses including norovirus, Covid and strep throat are closing schools in states around the country, including in &lt;a href="https://www.kark.com/news/state-news/flu-outbreak-causes-arkansas-school-district-to-shut-down-for-two-days/" target="_blank"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, Kansas, &lt;a href="https://www.lex18.com/news/covering-kentucky/robertson-county-schools-closes-through-friday-due-to-flu-strep-throat-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, Tennessee and West Virginia, where overall cases are reported to be low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-395355" class="body-graf"&gt;Idaho, New Mexico, New York and parts of Appalachia are still experiencing very high levels of flu, while the number of reported cases is low in Montana, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbb335" class="body-graf"&gt;“The amount of people hospitalized for influenza around New Year’s was really high, the second highest in the past 10 years, with last year being the highest,” Carlton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d69a7" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-2026-states-deaths-cdc-symptoms-superflu-rcna251910" target="_blank"&gt;notably bad&lt;/a&gt; flu season this year is driven by a highly mutated strain of influenza A called H3N2 subclade K, which has key mutations that make it less similar to the strain used in this year’s flu vaccine. Influenza-like illnesses, which include other flu-like viruses including RSV and Covid, are also very high this year, Nuzzo said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9bfbb5" class="body-graf"&gt;Usually these viruses surge in the same season, “but they are fortunately often staggered,” she said, noting that this year the viruses appear to be peaking around the same time, making this year’s cold and flu season particularly brutal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f34ed" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts had worried earlier that the flu vaccine wouldn’t be a good match against the subclade K. Recent research found that the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-vaccine-2026-effective-symptoms-new-research-rcna252659" target="_blank"&gt;current flu vaccine is effective against the variant&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd3156" class="body-graf"&gt;The current flu shot protects against three strains: two A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and one B strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-132fcb" class="body-graf"&gt;“With this K clade, we can still say the flu vaccine is helpful, especially for keeping you out of the hospital,” Nuzzo said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-382366" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year was the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm#:~:text=Since%20that%20time%2C%20the%20highest%20number%20of,(210)%20was%20reported%20during%20the%202023%E2%80%9324%20season." target="_blank"&gt;deadliest&lt;/a&gt; flu season for kids since the CDC began tracking pediatric deaths. A reported 289 children died from the flu, surpassing the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c89236" class="body-graf"&gt;“That double hump last flu season clearly had consequences,” Nuzzo said. “I will take any decrease in flu that we have, but we cannot say the worst is behind us,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e8985b" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the new CDC report, among children who were eligible for the flu shot and with known status of their vaccination, 90% of the pediatric deaths were in kids who weren’t vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2bd144" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Under a recent change in the CDC’s guidance, flu shots are no longer&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-overhaul-kids-denmark-fewer-childhood-shots-rcna250055" target="_blank"&gt; recommended for all children.&lt;/a&gt; Previously, the CDC had advised everyone 6 months and older to get a flu shot every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:33:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPLXJiaVMxaGJoYUh3eXNnaWhjb19hUHJrUUhGY2RsNm9wd0U5T1NqbzdsNkZZRk4yRmtDYzVWY3JtTkVscUctLXNLb2dkcEdHSXhHNkx3ZUxjZFpSc3YxaWF4cnFoNEFYbFZCdUJVbGEwTkg2Mlp3WkNHS0k2OTNsVXY4aGNFajR4NlFBV0Zsa0l0SXVWWV9iXzVBQmVWMV9BM1h4TW11M1luUjlwOUtkQU83SlF2WnZXWGNwUg</guid></item><item><title>最近的一场悲剧让我的孩子们深受其害。但我非常高兴。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2026/01/parenting-advice-kids-grieving-mom-happy.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

Our boys were ages 2 and 5 at the time. Despite being a cheating asshole, Peter did remain a devoted father, and I swallowed my animosity toward him for the sake of parenting the kids effectively after the divorce. But now something terrible has happened to him.&lt;/p&gt;

The boys are devastated, but if I’m being honest, I’m secretly pleased the bastard is gone. The kids, however, are confused about why I’m not saddened by his loss. How am I supposed to handle this? It feels so disingenuous to try putting on an act of grief over the death of the scumbag.&lt;/p&gt;

Tell them that you are sad for their loss and that you hate the fact that someone who meant so much to them is no longer here. Explain that their emotions are the ones that matter most right now; if you need to offer more that, you can share that you grieved your relationship with your ex long ago and that his place in your life was based on who he was to them. Encourage them to share how they are processing the loss and be vocal about your empathy: “I’m so sorry this happened,” “I know how hard this must be for you.” I’m sure you do feel bad for your children, even if you don’t feel bad about your ex. Lean into your concern for them and away from your feelings of victory, no matter how well earned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants wore wrist devices that tracked their sleep and movements for a week; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/moving-more-could-add-years-to-your-life-11775856" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;moderate to vigorous physical activity&lt;/a&gt; counted as exercise. They were also awarded scores on their diets, ranging from zero to 100, with a higher score indicating a healthier diet. Participants earned more points for doing things like eating at least three servings of vegetables a day, three servings of whole grains, or skipping sugary drinks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The research found that people with the worst health habits—which was defined as sleeping 5.5 hours per night, exercising 7.3 minutes per day, and having a diet quality score of 36.9—could add a year to their life if they made small combined tweaks including getting five extra minutes of sleep a night, 1.9 extra minutes of exercise per day, and adding an extra half-serving of vegetables or 1.5 servings of whole grains daily.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the study findings, the same one-year extension could also be achieved by doing just one of the following: 25 extra minutes of sleep per night, 2.3 extra minutes of exercise a day, or a 35.5-point increase in diet quality score. For reference, a 5-point increase in diet quality score equates to an additional 1/2 serving of vegetables per day or one fewer serving of processed meat a week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers also found that people with the poorest health habits could &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/healthy-aging-guide-7571546" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increase their health spans&lt;/a&gt;—the years you live free of diseases such as cancer, dementia, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes—by four years if they got 24 extra minutes of sleep a night and 3.7 extra minutes of exercise per day and added an extra cup of vegetables per day, a serving of whole grains per day, or two servings of fish per week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, bigger changes may lead to even greater lifespan increases. Adding 180 more minutes of sleep a night, increasing exercise by nearly 25 minutes a day, and achieving a 35-point increase in diet quality score could extend your life by up to 10 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The findings suggest that focusing on combined small changes across multiple behaviors may offer a more powerful and sustainable strategy to improve health outcomes than targeting larger changes in an individual behavior,” co-lead researcher Dr. Nicholas Koemel &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2025/02/27/combine-these-tiny-health-tweaks-for-a-longer-life--say-research.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;told the University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt;.
