   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug administration has approved the U.S.'s first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a procedure generations of women have dreaded and often found painful.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new device by &lt;a href="https://www.getteal.com/news/fda-approves-teal-healths-teal-wand-tm---the-first-and-only-at-home-self-collection-device-for-cervical-cancer-screening-introducing-a-comfortable-alternative-to-in-person-screening" target="_blank"&gt;Teal Health&lt;/a&gt; will offer a "much preferred experience," the company said in its announcement, and also aims to increase screening rates by making the procedure more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, gynecologists have inserted a cold metal speculum deep into a woman's vagina to scrape cells from the cervix. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Teal Wand — "built with empathy," the company said — uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample. Women will then mail the sample to a lab that will screen for HPV (human papillomavirus), the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers. A growing body of research has found &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/03/625696664/for-women-over-30-there-may-be-a-better-choice-than-the-pap-smear" target="_blank"&gt;HPV testing&lt;/a&gt; to be highly accurate.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The FDA approval Friday follows a &lt;a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63d5330e6841081487be0bd6/681d6148758c5c1fe0c81f2e_Teal-Health-SELF-CERV-Report-May92025-sml.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;U.S.-based study&lt;/a&gt; that found at-home screening was just as effective as that done in a doctor's office. The study also found women overwhelmingly preferred self–screening at home, and said they'd be more likely to stay up to date with cervical cancer screenings that way.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Every year, about &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/cervical-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;13,000 cases&lt;/a&gt; of cervical cancer are diagnosed, and more than 4,000 women die from the disease. Rates are down dramatically since &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/04/30/398872421/the-great-success-and-enduring-dilemma-of-cervical-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Georgios Papanicolaou&lt;/a&gt; published a 1943 paper on how to use the Pap smear for screening, and it then became common.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But about a &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/cancer/increase-proportion-females-who-get-screened-cervical-cancer-c-09" target="_blank"&gt;quarter of women&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. are behind on such screenings, and medical experts say reducing that is key to the ultimate goal of eliminating cervical cancer. There's also a &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/cervical-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;racial gap&lt;/a&gt;, with Black and Native American women far more likely to die from cervical cancer than white women. The &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/09/12/g-s1-21283/cervical-cancer-hpv-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for teen and preteen girls, introduced in 2007, has also led to a global push to tackle the disease that way.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At-home cervical cancer screenings are already available in several other countries, including &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/self-collection-for-the-cervical-screening-test" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/08-09-2022-hpv-self-sampling-in-sweden-leading-to-faster-elimination-of-cervical-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Teal Health says its self-testing device will be available starting next month, in California first and then expanding. It will be by prescription, through a telehealth service, for women 25-65 years old who are "at average risk." The company says it's working with insurance companies to provide coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists have been exploring new ideas to tackle these concerns and increase not just our years but also our quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team has been testing a special approach that raises levels of a natural protein in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research was led by Professor Miguel Chillón at the Institute of Neurosciences of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (&lt;a href="https://web.ub.edu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UB&lt;/a&gt;), and it shines a light on what might someday help people stay healthier for a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;longer period&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protein-s-kl-and-its-role-in-aging"&gt;Protein s-KL and its role in aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein at the center of this work is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41581-018-0078-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Klotho&lt;/a&gt;, and the form used in the experiments is the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26599613/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;secreted version&lt;/a&gt; known as s-KL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that Klotho may influence a wide range of biological processes by managing signals that affect inflammation and cell aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name Klotho first appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/36285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scientific journals&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1990s, when experiments showed that a deficiency of this protein made mice look older and more frail at younger ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have been working with the Klotho protein for some time, due to its therapeutic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-old-are-you-really-new-tool-measures-aging-from-the-inside-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;potential&lt;/a&gt; for treating neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we wanted to see whether s-KL could also be beneficial for healthy aging by examining a broad range of factors,” explained Professor Chillón.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-differences-between-males-and-females"&gt;Differences between males and females&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of s-KL weren’t the same for male and female mice. Males showed clearer gains in lifespan and muscle strength, while females responded more strongly in measures of bone structure, especially when treated earlier in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These sex-based differences might be tied to how male and female bodies process viral vectors or express the s-KL protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormonal factors could also play a role, suggesting future human trials may need sex-specific &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/curiosity-might-help-you-stay-sharp-as-you-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;strategies&lt;/a&gt; to get the best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-improvements-with-s-kl-protein"&gt;Aging improvements with s-KL protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers noticed that mice given s-KL retained better muscle tissue composition, with less of the scarring often linked to older age. They also had stronger performance in tasks that tested endurance and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weakened bones can be a big danger in older adults, so it was intriguing that s-KL seemed to keep the inner bone structure more intact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding aligns with earlier &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16436465/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;observations&lt;/a&gt; that Klotho influences mineral balance in bone and may reduce the chances of fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-timing-may-matter"&gt;Why timing may matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice treated at 12 months old showed more pronounced improvements in longevity and physical health than those treated at 6 months. One reason could be that the aging mice produced higher levels of the s-KL protein after treatment, which may have amplified its &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-bodies-begin-breaking-down-two-very-precise-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding raises an important question: Could middle age be a better window for intervention than early adulthood? If so, the timing of s-KL therapy in humans could be just as critical as the treatment itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signs-of-brain-support"&gt;Signs of brain support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the physical improvements, the investigators measured changes in the hippocampus, a region crucial for memory and cognitive ability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They detected heightened markers of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4563705/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;adult neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt;, which is the process by which new neurons form in mature brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also evidence that key immune cells in the brain might be working in a more balanced way. This could help remove cellular waste and reduce the chronic inflammation tied to age-related brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used gene therapy vectors that prompted cells to produce s-KL over an extended period. These vectors included genetic instructions, and once inside the mice, the cells took over production of the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach was designed to boost s-KL levels in both the brain and other areas of the body. This helped ensure that many of the organs linked to muscle, bone, and memory got the extra support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-s-kl-protein-and-human-aging"&gt;s-KL protein and human aging?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this study was done in mice, the results open the door to potential &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/defying-time-three-ways-to-slow-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;therapies&lt;/a&gt; for humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age-related decline in mobility, memory, and bone strength all contribute to lower independence and quality of life in older adults. A treatment that addresses these together could shift how we think about aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many current drugs only target one issue at a time, like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/outdoor-exercise-amplifies-physical-and-mental-health-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-sleep-may-predict-memory-loss-years-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;. But the effects of s-KL span across systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This points toward the possibility of a more unified strategy to aging – one that works with the body’s existing repair mechanisms rather than replacing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-s-kl-protein-research"&gt;What’s next for s-KL protein research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we can find a viable delivery method, s-KL could make a significant contribution to improving people’s quality of life and helping to build the healthiest society possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists continue to explore whether direct protein administration or refined gene-based aging options might work best for humans. They plan to keep studying how s-KL weaves into different biological pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(25)00120-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 16:39:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQNjBnZjNqVGNIT09iSUNvTUg5T19ZYmhQUTRPZmFiYVNNUl9DbjV5czB3UVE4eklLMGZFYUhWdVQwUmVDV0Z4N2VrODFLX3dnSnpIQVU4Yk9kVC1LQjhxSzhVcm5hdmstdmY5NmRuNVl4ZThVUndSamc2ZGZvR2RJUU9DcGRJNWJRSlVFV1UxOWlsRGlxOHNBSi1uaUtxNmc4emJoZnhrT0RfZTQ</guid></item><item><title>如果你想好好衰老，专家说你应该立即开始做这些非常简单的事情- buzzfeed.com | If You Want To Age Well, Experts Say You Should Start Doing These Very Simple Things Immediately - buzzfeed.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNSG1oUVhrbEZFeURLMEZSVXNGSldZTWVLbzRlRElnYnNFQWdTdFJzZ2wtaGdjZ0VHUzV1a2tOeVNnUkdkQVgxa2h6TnRDWFh4S09WRFduZll0R0g1M0h2c19yR3Baam5tWEVTeTV3cU5XUU1KZWJNWEZuMmctbEFDczB0ZDNpUXJENTNn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;“So often, people don’t age well because they’re not upfront about what their needs are,” said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robyn-golden-2466315/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7874738" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Robyn Golden&lt;/a&gt;, the associate vice president of social work and community health at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. “How do we make it OK for people to say, ‘This is what I need, I’m feeling lonely, I need someone to go out with on a Tuesday night.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rampant ageism makes it easy for people to feel like a burden or invisible, Golden said, which can encourage silent suffering. But it’s important to push against that and let folks know when you’re having a tough time. So if you’re someone who can share your thoughts and needs with your family and friends, that’s a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, if you’re struggling with depression and anxiety, it’s important to let your doctor know. There’s often a false belief that anxiety or depression after a certain age is more “normal,” but Golden said this is not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression can be treated at any age, and not just with medication, with counseling, with group interventions, you name it. So, I think that’s part of how you age well, being open to being able to say, ‘This is who I am, this is what I need,’” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;

These chemicals are &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/formaldehyde.html"&gt;known carcinogens&lt;/a&gt;, which means they &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/health-and-families/acne-best-treatment-cancer-benzene-clearasil-b2510485.html"&gt;can cause cancer or help it grow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was based on surveys filled out by 70 Black and Latina women in Los Angeles. Each time one of the women used a personal care product, they took a picture of the ingredient label and sent it to researchers via an app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-three percent of the women used at least one personal care product that listed formaldehyde releasers on its label, the study found. These women also reported using many of these products daily or multiple times per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carcinogen was found in 58 percent of the haircare products reported, the study revealed. But women also reported using shampoo, lotions, body soap and eyelash glue that contain the carcinogen. Twelve of the lotions containing formaldehyde-releasing preservatives that the women reported using were from the same brand: Bath &amp;amp; Body Works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 gwYuPU"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/10/15/03/iStock-1059157466.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/10/15/03/iStock-1059157466.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/10/15/03/iStock-1059157466.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The study found that various products, including hair-straighteners, shampoos, lotions and eyelash glues, contain formaldehyde" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-65281"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;The study found that various products, including hair-straighteners, shampoos, lotions and eyelash glues, contain formaldehyde&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Bath &amp;amp; Body Works for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formaldehyde &lt;a href="/news/health/formaldehyde-toxic-chemical-epa-warning-b2672869.html"&gt;presents an “unreasonable risk of injury to human health” in current practices&lt;/a&gt;, the Environmental Protection Agency said in January. Previous studies had already revealed the carcinogen is in products to help straighten hair or smooth curls, and it &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39020161/"&gt;poses a disproportionate risk to Black women&lt;/a&gt; and other women of color. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week’s study is the first to demonstrate that the carcinogen is in a wide variety of products beyond hair straighteners, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that this isn’t just about hair straighteners,” lead author Dr. Robin Dodson said in a &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.silentspring.org/news/formaldehyde-releasers-found-common-personal-care-products"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “These chemicals are in products we use all the time, all over our bodies.

We shouldn’t have to be chemists to figure out what kinds of products will make us sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/topic/european-union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and ten U.S. states have banned or proposed a ban on formaldehyde. The &lt;a href="/topic/food-and-drug-administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; even proposed a national ban on formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing chemicals in 2023, but it has yet to be enacted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dodson said the best solution would be ending the use of these chemicals in personal products altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ideally, companies shouldn’t be putting these chemicals in products in the first place,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 16:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQMnozN1pZbC1OSVVRVlhBR0JyQzhOam51M0VCQ0lvSU5nU29WZmdJcF92LUpQRW1ZeFZnU1RtamRLTzV1SmJtRUxYTUZIZVlKZ2xPUTJSZTgyaFh2OHFLOHN6eHM1dVRldDltU1h2QnlFVnozaDRYZXVrUUtMNmxDUVdPQ2pKUEstdEpKcml1RE5JZmx1Slk0bzV2b0dMMC13Nktv</guid></item><item><title>大量使用社交媒体与相信和传播假新闻有关-神经科学新闻 | Heavy Social Media Use Linked to Believing and Spreading Fake News - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE9VV1hKTHhiMWs3QTRUdkRsQXdSVktUQ3FscWVMaFNMYjVaeFhQUVpwbHQwams5dTgyTnRZWWY1NFg0UzFDSlBTUnFEWWR1djNvZy1Na3QycTZKbkZlMEFoMVdQbHd5SFE2VmtYY0VsNm52UkFzWEwyN0Zn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Individuals who experience high levels of distress and functional impairment from excessive social media use are significantly more likely to believe fake news and interact with it.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that this overuse is associated with a greater tendency to believe in and engage with misinformation,” said Dar Meshi, an associate professor and co-author of the study, which published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; and was funded by MSU’s Trifecta Initiative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshi and his co-author, Maria D. Molina, both faculty members in the MSU College of Communication Arts and Sciences, conducted an online experiment in which 189 participants, age 18 to 26, were presented with 20 news stories formatted as social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten of the stories were real and ten were false, and the order of delivery was randomized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By assessing participants’ credibility judgment of these news posts; participants intentions to click, comment, like and share posts; and their degree of problematic social media use, Meshi and Molina found that the greater people’s symptoms of problematic social media use, the more likely they were to: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;believe fake news is true; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;interact with news posts regardless if they were real or fake; and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;want to click on fake news posts. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fake or false news falls under two categories: misinformation if it is unintentionally distributed and disinformation if it is intentionally distributed to deceive people.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“False news has become a hotly debated and researched topic because of its availability to be shared and spread over social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over 60% of people in the U.S. read content on social media, and research has demonstrated that false news disseminates over social media at a greater rate than real news,” said Molina.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe their study is the first to look at how problematic social media use is involved with people’s trust in fake news by measuring their intended actions, like clicking, liking and sharing posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the American Psychiatric Association doesn’t recognize problematic social media use as a clinical disorder, Meshi points out that it shares similarities with substance use and other behavioral addictive disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who display problematic social media use may feel bad if they can’t access it, and they might even return to it after trying to quit. This kind of behavior has been linked to job loss, poor grades and mental health issues,” Meshi said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshi and Molina hope their findings will help mental health professionals working with people who struggle with social media use, as well as others in the health care field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals with signs of problematic social media use may also be more susceptible to health-related misinformation, so clinicians specializing in different fields may benefit from awareness of their patients’ degree of social media use,” said Molina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings could also help inform efforts from governmental agencies, organizations and social media companies to combat misinformation and disinformation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By identifying people who are more likely to believe fake news, we can help reduce its spread,” Meshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Researchers could work with social media companies to find ways to help these users and limit their exposure to fake news.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this misinformation and psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b2c6d7d9dbc2d3ded7f2dfc1c79cd7d6c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alex Tekip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://msu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Alex Tekip – Michigan State University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Problematic social media use is associated with believing in and engaging with fake news&lt;/a&gt;” by Dar Meshi et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problematic social media use is associated with believing in and engaging with fake news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media use is ubiquitous in our modern society, and some individuals display excessive, maladaptive use of these online platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This problematic social media use (PSMU) has been associated with greater impulsivity and risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, studies in healthy individuals have demonstrated that greater cognitive impulsivity is associated with a greater susceptibility to online “fake news.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we hypothesized that PSMU would be associated with believing in and engaging with fake news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, we conducted an online, within-subject experiment in which participants (N=189; female=102, male=86, prefer not to disclose=1; mean age=19.8 years) completed a fake news task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This task presented participants with 20 news stories (10 real and 10 false, in random order) formatted as social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed participants’ credibility judgments of these news posts, as well as participants’ intentions to click, like, comment, and share these posts. We also assessed participants’ degree of PSMU and then related this measure to their performance in our task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a mixed model approach, and it revealed that the greater one’s PSMU, the more one finds specifically false news credible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that the greater one’s PSMU, the greater one’s engagement with news posts, agnostic to the type of content (real or false).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we found that the greater one’s PSMU, the greater one’s intent to click on specifically false news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research demonstrates that individuals who experience the most distress and impairment in daily functioning from social media use are also the most susceptible to false information posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discuss the clinical implications of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 15:37:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9VV1hKTHhiMWs3QTRUdkRsQXdSVktUQ3FscWVMaFNMYjVaeFhQUVpwbHQwams5dTgyTnRZWWY1NFg0UzFDSlBTUnFEWWR1djNvZy1Na3QycTZKbkZlMEFoMVdQbHd5SFE2VmtYY0VsNm52UkFzWEwyN0Zn</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现隐藏在普通视线中的阿尔茨海默氏症的隐藏原因- SciTechDaily | Scientists Discover Hidden Cause of Alzheimer’s Hiding in Plain Sight - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNZFJ1Y0pEYUxnLS15MTJBVXJfVFppMDBtM0RBaHMtcjVXU0tVSm9vamVveXR2SkFsVGl3RDRud3hLV01SWlhQaXdmc1czbWpCS1VCanZvWkRWUE1wQUVubmF2Q3M1czYyelBOeGxKTy1XQ1ZKOUFFNmhTT3Z4VlV2OER2Y3BHcmZTelJnNWZJU2lEZFpjR3JXbm93?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 15:12:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNZFJ1Y0pEYUxnLS15MTJBVXJfVFppMDBtM0RBaHMtcjVXU0tVSm9vamVveXR2SkFsVGl3RDRud3hLV01SWlhQaXdmc1czbWpCS1VCanZvWkRWUE1wQUVubmF2Q3M1czYyelBOeGxKTy1XQ1ZKOUFFNmhTT3Z4VlV2OER2Y3BHcmZTelJnNWZJU2lEZFpjR3JXbm93</guid></item><item><title>Your Brain Maps Actions Like It Maps Space -神经科学新闻 | Your Brain Maps Actions Like It Maps Space - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE9KcG5MTkZHblJWWUlhNWRQRkdJTzktZElCNlUzNEFQRjlkNXFGU2YtV1BiYk9seXlLd3dmM1lPM2hCVUFwTzdxVG5wZGgta28xbUhKZENZUG50bDY3RWxNS0ViV2o4NFdTUE1iNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that the human brain organizes action-outcome associations in cognitive maps, much like how it maps physical space for navigation. These action maps are formed in the hippocampus and communicate with the motor system to support goal-directed behaviors and flexible decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using virtual reality tasks and fMRI, researchers observed that the brain represents similar actions closer together in this map-like structure, influencing how we perceive and choose between them.

For instance, the same keypress action can lead to different outcomes depending on whether it’s performed on a computer keyboard, a radio, or another context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often have multiple alternative choices, so that action selection requires comparing across available action-outcomes, which is a non-trivial and taxing problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do we compare the many action plans stored in memory and select the most appropriate one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We propose that these action-outcome associations could be organized in a cognitive map within the hippocampal system, potentially supporting efficient action selection within the rich human behavioural repertoire” explains Irina Barnaveli, first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hippocampus is a part of the brain involved in forming memories and navigating in space. Navigation relies heavily on the creation of maps of space. Our study suggests that we create similar maps for organizing and selecting action plans, linking perception to action.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the immersive virtual reality, participants performed a motor interaction task, in which they learned how to control the flying and catching of a virtual ball using different actions. Later, they compared learned actions while their brain activity was monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found patterns of brain activity that are typically interpreted as signatures of ‘cognitive mapping’, suggesting that the brain abstracts and organizes action plans in a map-like representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This map is also evident from participants’ behaviour: the closer the actions are within the hypothesised map, the more similar they are perceived by the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, this cognitive map in the hippocampal system exchanges information with the motor system to relate multiple action plans to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The map-like representations might therefore represent how humans interact with their environment in a very general sense, well beyond the specific case of spatial navigation. By supporting action selection, cognitive maps could contribute to optimizing the acquisition and exploitation of a wide repertoire of action plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This discovery further challenges the classical distinction between declarative and procedural memory, suggesting that goal-directed actions rely on multiple neural systems that integrate action generation, motor planning, and memory”, concludes Christian Doeller, last author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bettina Hennebach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Bettina Hennebach – Max Planck Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59153-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hippocampal-entorhinal cognitive maps and cortical motor system represent action plans and their outcomes&lt;/a&gt;” by Irina Barnaveli et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hippocampal-entorhinal cognitive maps and cortical motor system represent action plans and their outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficiently interacting with the environment requires weighing and selecting among multiple alternative actions based on their associated outcomes. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these processes are still debated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that forming relations between arbitrary action-outcome associations involve building a cognitive map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an immersive virtual reality paradigm, participants learned 2D abstract motor action-outcome associations and later compared action combinations while their brain activity was monitored with fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observe a hexadirectional modulation of the activity in entorhinal cortex while participants compared different action plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, hippocampal activity scales with the 2D similarity between outcomes of these action plans. Conversely, the supplementary motor area represents individual actions, showing a stronger response to overlapping action plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the connectivity between hippocampus and supplementary motor area is modulated by the similarity between the action plans, suggesting their complementary roles in action evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings provide evidence for the role of cognitive maps in action selection, challenging classical models of memory taxonomy and its neural bases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 14:46:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE9KcG5MTkZHblJWWUlhNWRQRkdJTzktZElCNlUzNEFQRjlkNXFGU2YtV1BiYk9seXlLd3dmM1lPM2hCVUFwTzdxVG5wZGgta28xbUhKZENZUG50bDY3RWxNS0ViV2o4NFdTUE1iNQ</guid></item><item><title>运动促进帕金森氏症的干细胞治疗-神经科学新闻 | Exercise Boosts Stem Cell Therapy for Parkinson’s - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE5CT1lfQXA2aktIZWZ1cHdFVGZwdHJXUFBOQ2REeGdISkFic05WaUQtS3FiN2dtT2lhNWFrVGg2V2ZpX05ROThFTkhIMVppV1UtZ3JqZ3dTcXVGUTladlpEY0MzcklEeTgyMmVHeWZkT01xdmIz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Exercise enhances the effectiveness of stem cell-derived neuron transplants in a Parkinson’s disease (PD) rat model. Transplanted neurons alone improved basic motor functions, but when combined with voluntary exercise, the rats displayed significantly better agility and paw control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that exercise helped transplanted neurons mature and form stronger connections with host brain cells, likely due to an increase in beneficial brain proteins. These findings suggest that exercise could be a simple, non-invasive way to boost outcomes in future PD stem cell therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapy Synergy:&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise enhanced the function of stem cell-derived neuron transplants in PD rats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise promoted transplant maturation and connectivity with host neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Suggests a safe, accessible way to improve outcomes in human PD trials.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;International Society for Stem Cell Research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease that affects approximately 10 million people worldwide, with numbers steadily increasing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include tremors, difficulties with movement and speech, as well mental health issues and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109736"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows people exercising." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Their research found that voluntary exercise improved the maturation of the transplant and the establishment of connections between the transplant and the rat neurons. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although PD can be managed by medication and lifestyle adjustments, the efficacy of these interventions varies between patients and cannot stop or reverse disease progression.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PD is caused by progressive loss of a certain type of neurons in the brain which produce dopamine, a chemical substance required to control movement, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouragingly, studies dating back to the eighties have shown that replacing lost dopaminergic neurons with donated fetal tissue-derived neurons can improve symptoms in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, researchers have made progress in generating a replenishable source of dopaminergic neurons from pluripotent stem cells in the lab and achieved promising results when transplanting these cells in animal models of PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, clinical trials are ongoing to test the safety and efficacy of transplanting such stem cell-derived neurons in PD patients. A key to success in patients will be the successful integration and maturation of the transplanted cells within the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, a research team led by Clare Parish from The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health (in Melbourne) and Lachlan Thompson from the University of Sydney, Australia has now tested whether exercise enhances transplant function in PD rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, rats received a stem cell-derived transplant to replace lost dopaminergic neurons and some of the rats were given free access to a running wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work was recently published in &lt;em&gt;Stem Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the neural grafts improved gross motor function, combined with exercise saw paw movements and agility improved significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research found that voluntary exercise improved the maturation of the transplant and the establishment of connections between the transplant and the rat neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A likely cause for this was the enhanced secretion of certain beneficial proteins in the brains of exercising rats which promoted transplant survival and integration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, exercise may be a non-invasive and easily implemented strategy to enhance treatment outcomes in PD patients in combination with stem cell-derived transplants, warranting further testing in upcoming clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Parkinson’s disease and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fa9191939698958f88949fba9389899988d495889d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kym Kilbourne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://isscr.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;International Society for Stem Cell Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kym Kilbourne – International Society for Stem Cell Research&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2025.102480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exercise promotes the functional integration of human stem cell-derived neural grafts in a rodent model of Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Clare Parish et al. &lt;em&gt;Stem Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise promotes the functional integration of human stem cell-derived neural grafts in a rodent model of Parkinson’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived dopamine neurons can functionally integrate and reverse motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease models, motivating current clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, dopamine neuron proportions remain low and their plasticity inferior to fetal tissue grafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence shows exercise can enhance neuron survival and plasticity, warranting investigation for hPSC-derived neural grafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show voluntary exercise (wheel running) significantly increases graft plasticity, accelerating motor recovery in animals receiving ectopic, but not homotopic, placed grafts, suggestive of threshold requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plasticity was accompanied by increased phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK+) cells in the graft (and host), reflective of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-ERK signaling, a downstream target of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), proteins that were also elevated.

    &lt;p&gt;Ava Langenhop was always sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From "the time she was born," she was "just a sick baby," the 9-year-old's mother, Alicia Langenhop, told CBS News. She'd catch any cough or cold. Before she was two months old, she went to the hospital twice for viral infections. Ear infections were constant. Scraped knees turned into skin infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alicia and Jon Langenhop didn't understand what was causing it. They thought Alicia might be bringing illnesses home from her job at a local daycare. When their second daughter, Olivia, was born, she "followed the same path": Constant illnesses, frequent infections and multiple hospitalizations. It was grueling, the parents said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a real strain, trying to figure out whose turn is it next to stay home with the sick kid, and all the different hospital bills and doctor's visits," Alicia Langenhop said. "That was a pretty rough first three years of having kids." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ava was three, her gums started to get inflamed and bleed during brushing. A periodontist suggested that the Langenhops test their daughters for autoimmune diseases. It was a world the young couple was completely unfamiliar with.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had to travel to Cincinnati, about four hours from where they lived in Canton, Ohio, to get tests that confirmed Ava had LAD-1. The rare disorder means a person's white blood cells are unable to enter infection sites and kill bacteria, leaving patients vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Langenhops struggled to understand the diagnosis, they got even more devastating news: Olivia, just a year old, also had the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is LAD-1, and how is it usually treated? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAD-1 symptoms start at birth, &lt;a href="https://primaryimmune.org/understanding-primary-immunodeficiency/types-of-pi/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency-lad" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Immune Deficiency Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Soft tissue infections, slow-healing wounds and gum infections are common. The lives of people diagnosed with it are "often severely shortened" because of the frequent illnesses, the foundation says. Alicia Langenhop said doctors told them not to Google the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only corrective treatment for LAD-1 is a stem cell transplant via bone marrow donation, according to the Immune Deficiency Foundation. Neither Langenhop parent was an exact match for their daughters, and the girls couldn't donate to each other since they each had the disease. There was one other familial possibility: Alicia Langenhop was pregnant. They hoped their son would be able to donate bone marrow. But when Landon Langenhop was born in October 2019, tests found that he also had LAD-1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news left the parents "overwhelmed," the mother of three said. It also meant they had to turn to the national bone marrow donor registry. There were no exact matches for the children, and the Langenhops weren't satisfied with the odds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The success rate with a match from the registry was 75%. That didn't really sit well with us, because that's a 25% chance that each of our kids would not survive the transplant," Alicia Langenhop said. It wasn't what she and her husband wanted to hear "when talking about their lives." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an appointment, a member of the Langenhops' care team mentioned that a doctor in Los Angeles was interested in speaking with them about a clinical trial he was helping lead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was kind of a no-brainer for us to try it, at least," Jon Langenhop said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Clinical study recap &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Langenhops enrolled in a clinical trial testing an investigational therapy developed by Rocket Pharmaceuticals. Nine patients were enrolled in the trial across three clinical sites. The group was so small because of the rarity of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Donald Kohn, a pediatric bone marrow transplant physician who led the trial site at UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital in California, said the therapy essentially allows a patient to be their own stem cell donor. That makes it safer than a bone marrow donation, Kohn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a patient was given a chemotherapy medication to encourage their stem cells to leave the bone marrow where they form and travel into the bloodstream. Then, blood was collected and the stem cells separated from the blood cells. The stem cells were then transferred to Rocket Pharmaceuticals' laboratory. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, the cells were cultured and injected with a virus that carries the gene that LAD-1 patients are missing, Kohn said. The patient receives another round of high-dose chemotherapy to wipe out their existing bone marrow stem cells. Then, the new stem cells are brought back to the hospital and injected back into the patient through an IV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ava was the second person to be enrolled in the trial, followed by Olivia and Landon. The family had planned to travel between California and Ohio, returning home between treatments but the COVID-19 pandemic changed that. Instead, they lived in Los Angeles for about nine months. The kids were treated one by one, and each spent about a month in the hospital while they underwent the therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was heartbreaking to see them go through it all. It was painful with the chemo and all that. It was a lot to see them go through," Alicia Langenhop said. "One of us was spending all of our time in the hospital with one kid, while the other was back at the apartment with the other two kids. We felt like we didn't have another choice. We thought, 'This is what we have to do. We're going to get through this.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Recovery and science &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All nine patients produced healthy immune cells capable of fighting infections, Kohn said, and are continuing to do so. None of the patients who participated in the trial have had severe infections since their treatment, he said. Six of the patients will be followed by UCLA for at least 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're careful not to say cured, because that implies permanence, which we don't know," Kohn said. "But as far as we follow them ... there has been no change at all in the level of the number of gene-corrected cells. It's absolutely stable." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years after participating in the study, the Langenhop children are doing well. Ava plays basketball. Olivia, a dancer and cheerleader, just celebrated her seventh birthday. Landon is playing T-ball. All three are enrolled in public school. Since they participated in the trial, none of them have had to go to the hospital, except for their annual follow-ups with Kohn.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When they had their first scraped knee or cold after the transplant and didn't get extremely sick, actually seeing it with our own eyes, really made it obvious that it was working, and that it was all worth it," Alicia Langenhop said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The therapy that the clinical trial studied is now under review with the Food and Drug Administration, UCLA &lt;a href="https://stemcell.ucla.edu/news/gene-therapy-restores-immune-function-and-extends-lives-children-rare-immune-disorder" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;said in a news release&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to have the therapy approved as a licensed product that can be used to treat patients, Kohn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Langenhops said they are honored that their children could help create a medication that may be used to treat others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's incredible. It's fascinating to us, because we're just normal people," Alicia Langenhop said. "When you think of the numbers and think how we had three of the nine patients that received this, and possibly because of that other kids in the future could receive this treatment, it's pretty indescribable." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever struggled to pick out your friend's voice over other conversations in a crowded room? Scientists call this challenge the "cocktail party problem," and it can be especially difficult for people with hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most hearing aids come with directional filters that help users focus on sounds in front of them. They're best at reducing static background noise, but falter in more complex acoustic scenarios, such as when the user is among cocktail-party guests who are standing close together and speaking at a similar volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new algorithm could improve how hearing aids tackle the cocktail party problem. The model, dubbed the "biologically oriented sound segregation algorithm" (BOSSA), draws inspiration from the brain's auditory system, which uses inputs from both ears to locate the source of a noise and can filter out sound by location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex-Boyd-12" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex-Boyd-12" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alexander Boyd&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a doctoral student in biomedical engineering at Boston University, compared directional filters and BOSSA to flashlights, in that they highlight what is in their path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/vestigial-human-ear-wiggling-muscle-actually-flexes-when-were-straining-to-hear" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/vestigial-human-ear-wiggling-muscle-actually-flexes-when-were-straining-to-hear"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Vestigial' human ear-wiggling muscle actually flexes when we're straining to hear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BOSSA is a new flashlight that has a tighter beam that's more selective," he told Live Science. Compared with the standard filters, BOSSA should be better at distinguishing between speakers — though it still needs to be tested in real-world scenarios with proper hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd led a recent lab test of BOSSA, whose results were published April 22 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_4102477377076216158&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs44172-025-00414-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fsolution-to-cocktail-party-problem-could-help-people-with-hearing-loss" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-025-00414-5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs44172-025-00414-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fsolution-to-cocktail-party-problem-could-help-people-with-hearing-loss" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Communications Engineering&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the experiment, participants with hearing loss donned headphones playing audio designed to simulate five people speaking simultaneously and from different angles around the listener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-VGjPbTiAwTkHAuQ6MZZFb9" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-VGjPbTiAwTkHAuQ6MZZFb9 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audio was filtered through either BOSSA or a more traditional hearing-aid algorithm, and the participants compared both filters to how they heard the audio without additional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each trial, participants were asked to follow sentences spoken by one of the five speakers. The volume of the "target speaker" relative to the other speakers varied between trials. When the target speaker was standing within 30 degrees of the listener in either direction, the participants could make out a greater proportion of words at a lower volume threshold with BOSSA than with the conventional algorithm or when unassisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conventional algorithm did seem to serve users better than BOSSA in distinguishing speech from static noise. However, this was tested in only four of the eight participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard algorithm works by reducing distracting sounds by boosting the signal-to-noise ratio for sounds coming from a given direction. By comparison, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.1004071/full" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.1004071/full" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BOSSA transforms sound waves&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into spikes of input that the algorithm can process, similar to how the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK531483/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK531483/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cochlea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the inner ear converts vibrations from sound waves into signals transmitted by neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm emulates how special cells in the midbrain — the uppermost portion of the brainstem that connects the brain and spinal cord — respond selectively to sounds coming from a given direction. These spatially tuned cells judge direction based on differences in the timing and volume of sound inputs to each ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd said this aspect of BOSSA drew from studies of the midbrain in barn owls, which have sophisticated spatial sensing abilities since they rely on sound cues to locate prey. The BOSSA-filtered signals are then reconstructed into sound for the listener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSSA is modeled on the nervous system's "bottom up" attention pathway, which gathers bits of sensory information that are then interpreted by the brain. These sensory inputs govern which aspects of the environment warrant focus and which can be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/evolution/our-outer-ears-may-have-come-from-ancient-fish-gills-scientists-discover" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/evolution/our-outer-ears-may-have-come-from-ancient-fish-gills-scientists-discover"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our outer ears may have come from ancient fish gills, scientists discover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But attention is also dictated by a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1073858413514136?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1073858413514136?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;"top down" pathway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which a person's prior knowledge and current goals shape their perception. In this case, an individual can decide what is relevant to focus on. These two modes of processing aren't necessarily mutually exclusive; for instance, your friend's voice might jump out at you both because you recognize it and because they're shouting over the sound of a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSSA's "bottom-up" approach can help people focus on speech coming from a predetermined location, but in real life, people rapidly shift their attention to different conversations. "You can't do that with this algorithm," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/michael.stone" target="_blank" data-url="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/michael.stone" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Michael Stone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an audiology researcher at the University of Manchester in the U.K. who was not involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone added that the study didn't replicate how sounds echo and reverberate in real life, especially in indoor settings. Still, he said BOSSA could be more practical for hearing aids than algorithms based on deep neural networks, another emerging approach to sound filtering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep neural network models need extensive training to be prepared for all the different configurations of speakers the user may encounter. And once implemented, the computational demands of these models require a lot of power. BOSSA is simpler by comparison, relying mainly on the spatial difference between two sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSSA may also be more transparent than the "black box" of deep neural networks, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=4560" target="_blank" data-url="https://faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=4560" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fan-Gang Zeng&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, professor of otolaryngology at University of California, Irvine, who was not involved with the research. That means it would be easier to interpret how sound inputs become algorithmic outputs, perhaps making the model simpler to refine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeng added that BOSSA may require further refining as it is studied in more-realistic scenarios. The researchers plan to test BOSSA in proper hearing aids, rather than in headphones, and also hope to develop a steering mechanism to help users direct the algorithm's focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-VGjPbTiAwTkHAuQ6MZZFb9-wqy1seEbsGF5xWu6NN9XM8MVaebMM6HI" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-VGjPbTiAwTkHAuQ6MZZFb9-wqy1seEbsGF5xWu6NN9XM8MVaebMM6HI slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There is now one more on that list in Maryland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;It’s called babesia and it causes something potentially terrible called babesiosis. That’s buh-bee-zee-oh-sis, if you’re seeing that for the first time — and pretty sure you are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;For years, there had only been a really small number of infections, so most doctors likely haven’t even seen a case. Recently, however, researchers found there is a growing number of these microscopic parasites in ticks in the mid-Atlantic area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;And Baltimore “is a hotspot,” said Ellen Stromdahl, a retired tick researcher from the Defense Centers for Public Health at U.S. Army Aberdeen Proving Ground who helped lead a study published last year in the &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1082221" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1082221"&gt;Journal of Entomology.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__inline-ad"&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__ad__text"&gt;The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/advertising/"&gt;Become one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The term hotspot is relative. The Maryland Department of Health identified only 29 infections in 2023 around the whole state, and some likely weren’t infected here. State officials said they don’t yet have 2024 numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;By comparison, in 2023, there were 2,463 cases of Lyme disease, also tick-borne. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;“There are not many cases, but we think it’s the tip of the iceberg and we want to give an early warning,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;And that’s the issue. Ticks are an increasing risk to people. And finding a new parasite once largely only found in northern states is troublesome to experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;That includes Dr. David Sullivan, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__inline-ad"&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__ad__text"&gt;The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/advertising/"&gt;Become one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;“It’s an indication that Lyme is going up if we’re finding babesia. It’s a proxy indicator for Lyme and for other diseases,” he said. “I’m more worried about ticks in Maryland than mosquitoes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The parasites causing babesiosis are spread by blacklegged, or deer, ticks. They infiltrate red blood cells and can lead to a dangerous, or rarely, even deadly level of anemia, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The good news is a lot of people never know they have it. No symptoms and no repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The bad news is that doctors may mistake the symptoms in people who do get sick for the flu or another malady that causes fever, body aches and fatigue. Misdiagnosis could mean a physician might not treat it properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Those at risk of a bad outcome are elderly and immunocompromised, experts say. Treatment to avoid more serious problems includes a combination of antiparasitic medications and antibiotics. It could also require a blood transfusion in more severe cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__inline-ad"&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__ad__text"&gt;The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/advertising/"&gt;Become one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Another hitch is that people can get infected at the same time with the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. Doctors may diagnose Lyme and prescribe antibiotics only, which will not knock out the parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Stromdahl and other researchers, including some from the Maryland Department of Health, set out on a two-year quest to collect and test ticks in the area after routine testing in her military lab years ago found the parasite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;They wanted to know if the parasite endemic in New England and other northern states and the Upper Midwest had found their way south. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;They are now in Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and West Virginia. In Maryland, they are most often found on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia, as well as the Baltimore region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Stromdahl wants to get the word out that the tick mix here now includes babesiosis, and doctors ought to order blood tests for those with symptoms and a tick bite. “It could save their lives,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__inline-ad"&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__ad__text"&gt;The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/advertising/"&gt;Become one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Sullivan noted that the threat remains low for now. Marylanders may still have a better chance of being struck by lightning than getting sick with babesiosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Of the ticks tested in Maryland in the study, less than 3% had the parasites for babesiosis, compared to about 20% to 30% with the bacteria for Lyme. Only one of six species, the deer tick, is responsible for the diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Also, an infection typically requires the tick to be attached for about 24 to 36 hours for transmission, and most people’s healthy immune systems clear it from the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The bottom line: If you see a tick and remove it within a day, you’re probably good, said Sullivan, and that goes for adult and baby ticks this time of year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-testid="header-container"&gt;A note about those ticks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The CDC advises that if you do find a tick, carefully pluck it off with tweezers and douse it with alcohol to kill it and place it in a sealed bag. You may be eligible for a preemptive Lyme treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;And also, this time of year it’s a good idea to &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/public-health/tick-season-lyme-disease-maryland-52LZRTLPSJGXZKNOER6BHH5HMU/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/public-health/tick-season-lyme-disease-maryland-52LZRTLPSJGXZKNOER6BHH5HMU/"&gt;use tick repellent and clothes that cover you up&lt;/a&gt; when you’re in tick-prone areas outside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Baltimore Banner</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQX0hYdDBudmpFSnJXWkVFVlBobVZjQVJua0htbkpDal9WeVc0V3JUVGRIQVg1b1A2RnJNMWE4MEh1YkxvYTQxcnFiNS1aVVJJYm0xSEVDZnhLaEUzbmlDakJMRVF6U3pTR2VUYWZVUkZJSGkxNld3SE9vamx3R1pCTndiQkl5S29iaHItRlpUWlU2bEJacTdpQWNDSTNUeUY3MjhuTXNfelVsaWwzZUhHeHI1Y3pORzQ</guid></item><item><title>自闭症诊断正在上升–但自闭症本身可能不是-英国广播公司 | Autism diagnoses are on the rise – but autism itself may not be - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxNTFoxRXFmaHJBSEQ1RWU1OEdUWVlvUDJ2RERSTl92Ry1sWHVRQzh5U05SNTVhVkZNY2xNSUZNSEdYNExpaW5PVm12eFJxRzltOUlWTjBLQnRLRy1uMGxTamFpdVVuMVBPTkV5RV9fbXVPMFdKQlNPbmh3eUctSEdkVkIwVVlQZUk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-737179d2-0 dAzQyd"&gt;Autism diagnoses are on the rise – but autism itself may not be&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A woman holding up a dog for a child to interact with (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;(Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="autism-is-better-known-and-diagnosed-than-ever-before,-leading-to-misconceptions-that-cases-are-skyrocketing." class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Autism is better known and diagnosed than ever before, leading to misconceptions that cases are skyrocketing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And some of these criteria had been noticed by other people. As a toddler, Leo rarely made eye contact. In nursery school, he didn't respond to speech like the other kids. He frequently showed compulsive behaviours, like flapping his hands and chewing his clothes. He was easily stressed or overwhelmed. As a result, his diagnosis in 2003, at age two, was relatively straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Rosa wasn't given much guidance about next steps. "I felt very lost," says Rosa, an editor and mother of three who lives in California. "I was really angry." Like so many other parents, what she wanted to know, above all, was why her child had autism. Online, she found other parents seeking the same answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Over the years, Rosa realised she had been mistaken. Not only did Rosa eventually renounce her opposition to vaccination, she started a website, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://thinkingautismguide.com/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Thinking Person's Guide to Autism&lt;/a&gt;, to help others. "I have sympathy for people who believe this stuff because I've been there," she says.

Earlier this year, the US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr promised a "massive" research effort involving hundreds of scientists, to get to the bottom of what he has called an &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj0z9nmzvdlo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;autism "epidemic"&lt;/a&gt; before September 2025.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That can look alarming to people who don't know [the context of the statistics]", says Zoe Gross, the director of advocacy at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN), a US nonprofit run by autistic people. It's not necessarily that autism cases are increasing, Gross emphasises: rather, diagnoses are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Screenings for autism have become more sensitive, and many children are getting screened and identified earlier than in past years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As a recognised separate condition, autism is relatively new. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531066/#CR89" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;It wasn't included&lt;/a&gt; in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) – a book with details on the symptoms and recommended treatment of hundreds of mental conditions – until 1980. This means that before then, children with ASD often got misdiagnosed with a condition like schizophrenia, or were never diagnosed at all, Gross says. But even this recognition proved narrow. The 1980 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/eherman/teaching/texts/DSM-I%20-%20DSM-IV%20diagnostic%20criteria.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;criteria included&lt;/a&gt;, for example, an onset before 30 months of age, lack of responsiveness to other people, and language delays – and all of the criteria listed had to be met to receive a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the 45 years since, the diagnostic criteria for autism have broadened. An especially big shift came in 2013, when, for the first time, the DSM brought subcategories including Asperger's syndrome &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531066/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)&lt;/a&gt;. People who wouldn't previously have received an autism diagnosis now are more likely to meet the criteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Autism is highly heritable, but even among identical twins both may not develop it (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Autism is highly heritable, but even among identical twins both may not develop it (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In particular, people have a better understanding of the varied ways that autism may be visible – including in "people who might not have been caught in previous years, who maybe have less intense support needs", Gross says. This is true in many parts of the world. Yun-Joo Koh, the principal investigator at the Korea Institute for Children's Social Development, says that in this country, many parents are learning about ASD through social media and coming to her clinic earlier than they used to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;All of this means fewer hidden cases of autism. "Autistic people have always been here," says Rosa.

That means that, across a population, roughly 80% of the differences in ASD risk are due to genetic variation. In other words, genetics are behind most ASD cases. His research in Sweden has found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11024771/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;it's especially heritable among boys&lt;/a&gt;: 87% for boys and 75.7% for girls. As with so many aspects of autism epidemiology, it's not clear why, Sandin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But what does seem clear from his work, including &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1866100" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one of his Swedish studies&lt;/a&gt;, is that autism runs in families. Children whose full sibling had autism were 10 times as likely to have autism themselves, compared to children whose siblings did not have autism. If a half-sibling had autism, children were three times as likely to have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Studies of identical twins have found that if one individual has ASD, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7355281/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;65 to 90%&lt;/a&gt; of their twins also have it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But knowing that autism is heritable does not mean any one gene is responsible in everyone who has it. In fact, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8#page=50" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;more than 100 genes&lt;/a&gt; have been identified as having some connection to autism diagnosis – although these are not necessarily specific to autism, and there are often links to other conditions. In some people, it’s thought that there might be &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20250415-the-genetic-mystery-of-why-some-people-develop-autism" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;thousands of genes involved&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;&lt;span id="the-role-of-environment" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="the-role-of-environment" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;The role of environment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But genetics aren't the whole story. "The general belief is… that there is a huge variety of different genes and very complex genetic architecture, and probably with the environmental influences as well, to trigger [autism]", Sandin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99hfz.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images There are some environmental factors involved in the development of autism, but these do not include vaccines (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;There are some environmental factors involved in the development of autism, but these do not include vaccines (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Preterm births are also related to social factors like low income and food insecurity, which may partly explain the steeper rise of autism diagnoses in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/ss/ss7402a1.htm" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;minority children in the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some studies also have found correlations with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aur.2599" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;birth spacing&lt;/a&gt; and mothers' health conditions, including diabetes, smoking and obesity. But these have proven difficult to untangle – it's not clear whether maternal BMI directly contributes to autism, for example, or if it's just that older mothers tend to have higher BMIs, Sandin says – and may be related to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03479-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;shared environmental conditions&lt;/a&gt; rather than a direct link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is possible that at least some of these risk factors, while probably minor players individually, could be more substantial when added together. But overall, experts agree that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8#page=50" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;most environmental factors need to be researched further&lt;/a&gt; before reaching conclusions. What has been conclusively &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003143" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;ruled out&lt;/a&gt; is any link between vaccines – including certain &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/autism-spectrum-disorders" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; some contain – and ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is unsatisfying to many, Gross points out. "A lot of people are looking for a simple explanation, especially when autism is stigmatised, when they have been told many negative things about for maybe their own child's disability, and they want not only an explanation but something to blame."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The resulting vacuum has created space for simplistic ideas to spread – even those that lack evidence and have been repeatedly debunked. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1708223" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In the US&lt;/a&gt;, for example, where the current measles outbreak has &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2nzyjgrwxo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;claimed multiple lives&lt;/a&gt;, children whose older siblings have ASD are less likely to be vaccinated themselves against measles, mumps and rubella – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1708223" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;likely due in part&lt;/a&gt; to the long-debunked link between autism and vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One reason it's common to be alarmed about increasing autism diagnoses, says Gross, is that societies generally haven't built sufficient support systems to accompany a diagnosis. A way to make an autism diagnosis less scary would be to improve the support, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Rosa agrees. The real crisis, she says, is not of autism, but care and support – which she's found lacking for Leo, who is today a 24-year-old who loves hiking and pizza. As Rosa continues seeking the best ways to support her son, researchers will continue unravelling the science of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 09:01:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNTFoxRXFmaHJBSEQ1RWU1OEdUWVlvUDJ2RERSTl92Ry1sWHVRQzh5U05SNTVhVkZNY2xNSUZNSEdYNExpaW5PVm12eFJxRzltOUlWTjBLQnRLRy1uMGxTamFpdVVuMVBPTkV5RV9fbXVPMFdKQlNPbmh3eUctSEdkVkIwVVlQZUk</guid></item><item><title>与春季过敏一起享受的8种文学“经典” -《纽约时报》 | 8 Literary ‘Classics’ to Enjoy With Your Spring Allergies - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOZUx1UW1jY2VRWW53c2hHMjNMaFp5YVpsaUdzZDVPVkduUk03NHNJVkFvcTFVUG5kQXpPNDlnX2ItZVVkajVOaXNIMGhkaVBNQjdhc1VLU1VUTEVJZ1U5X1dJSTFidjdid0hxN095ZFl0RzU5V18yQmpQZWhFQ21FbmpqcHJrQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="story" class="css-1y7abph e1lmdhsb0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-wqhysl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;header class="css-ay91f9 euiyums1"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1vkm6nb ehdk2mb0"&gt;&lt;h1 id="link-3c98706d" class="css-1uc375s e1h9rw200" data-testid="headline"&gt;8 Literary ‘Classics’ to Enjoy With Your Spring Allergies&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-summary" class="css-79rysd e1wiw3jv0"&gt;A tale of pollen and prejudice, and more.

If you're not especially keen on the gym, this might seem like bad news - the solution is frequent exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent investigation by the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00184-9/abstract" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Norwegian University of Science and Technology&lt;/a&gt; has delved into various human and animal studies, shedding light on how physical health can influence brain ageing. This research scrutinised factors such as brain plasticity, inflammation, and blood flow, which all play a role in the progression of neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite existing guidelines advising 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise every week, researchers posit that even minimal amounts can have a positive impact on brain health. They hope that highlighting this fact will motivate individuals to commence their fitness journeys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Ulrik Wisløff, who co-authored the research, &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1082648" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;: "We believe it's time for health authorities to provide clearer advice on how important exercise is for the brain. Our review shows that even small doses of high-intensity activity – equivalent to brisk walking where you can't sing – can reduce the risk of dementia by up to 40%."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Postdoctoral researcher, Atefe Rafiee Tari, also told&lt;a href="https://norwegianscitechnews.com/2025/04/exercise-helps-improve-how-our-brain-ages/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt; Norwegian Sci Tech News&lt;/a&gt;: "Today's recommendations emphasise total activity, but we show that even small amounts of high intensity exercise have an effect on the brain... Exercise is cheap, accessible and has no side effects. It should be considered a first-line measure to preserve brain health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia encompasses several conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, that result in a progressive decline in brain function. According to &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; figures, more than 944,000 people in the UK suffer from dementia, with one in every 11 over 65s affected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31595415" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although there is currently no cure for dementia, available treatments can help alleviate symptoms like confusion, memory loss, and speech difficulties. Yet, recent studies have also indicated that simple lifestyle changes could prevent up to 45% of dementia cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-03-27-risk-factors-faster-aging-brain-revealed-new-study#:~:text=Importantly%2C%20as%20Professor%20Anderson%20Winkler,them%20together%20to%20assess%20the" target="_self" rel="nofollow"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; found that lacking physical activity, alcohol, and pollution exposure were among the factors that could exacerbate dementia risk after assessing 40,000 brain scans. Furthermore, Dr Valter Longo, who directs the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California, has also emphasised the importance of fitness and brisk walking in long-term health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://valterlongo.com/exercise-and-longevity/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;previous blog&lt;/a&gt;, he stressed that strolling for just one hour per day could suffice. "Walk fast for an hour every day," Dr Longo said. On the weekend, walk everywhere, even faraway places (avoid polluted areas as much as possible)."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The NHS defines a brisk walk as moving at around three mph. If you're unsure of your walking speed, the health service suggests downloading the free Active 10 app on your smartphone, which can provide tips to increase your pace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It further advises: If you're not very active but are able to walk, increase your walking distance gradually. If your joints are a problem, check whether your local swimming pool holds exercise classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The water helps to support your joints while you move and can help you strengthen your muscles."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you got a story to share?

We don’t hunt mammoths or run from sabertooths anymore; most of us just &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/30/health/americans-screen-time-nielsen" target="_blank"&gt;sit in front of various screens&lt;/a&gt; for most of the day. We don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; our bodies to store endless calories as fat, or reduce our metabolism low enough to withstand an errant ice age – so how do we stop them from doing it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, there is one potential solution. &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(16)30024-9" target="_blank"&gt;A few years ago&lt;/a&gt;, researchers in the Weizmann Institute of Science, in Israel, were messing around with mouse genes when they accidentally discovered “Mitch” – or, to use its more formal name, MTCH2. It’s a protein, living right on the edge of the mitochondria, and it seems to be something of a master key to beat obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We discovered that deleting Mitch led to a major drop in fats in membranes,” said Atan Gross, head of the Institute’s Gross Lab where the research was undertaken and co-author of a recent paper investigating the protein’s effects in human cells, in a &lt;a href="https://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/life-sciences/slimming-mitch" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, we saw an increase in fatty substances used to produce energy,” he explained, “and we realized that the fat was being broken down from the membrane to be used as fuel.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice whose MTCH2 proteins were silenced, or deleted, developed increased athletic capacity – they grew more muscle fibers, and their stamina and heart function improved. At the same time, they seemed “immune” to obesity: even when fed high-fat diets and without exercise, they remained slim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, that’s great if you’re an aspiring supermodel mouse, but it didn’t help humans all that much – until now. In the new study, Gross and his team showed those results are applicable in human cells too: that silencing Mitch increases the rate at which fat and carbohydrates are burned, and stops the creation of new fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After deleting Mitch, we examined, every few hours, the effect that had on more than 100 substances taking part in metabolism in human cells,” explained Sabita Chourasia, a doctoral student in Gross’s lab who led the research. “We saw an increase in cellular respiration, the process in which the cell produces energy from nutrients, such as carbohydrates and fats, using oxygen.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This explains the increase in muscular endurance in previous experiments using mice,” Chourasia added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect seems to be multi-layered: MTCH2 plays a role in metabolic regulation, but it’s also a key regulator of mitochondrial fusion, the team discovered. Without it, then, the network of fused-together mitochondria inside our cells collapses, making them less able to efficiently produce energy – or, in other words, they suddenly need a whole lot more input for the same amount of output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all. The team also discovered that MTCH2 is responsible for fat cell differentiation, in which progenitor cells – that is, undifferentiated cells which have the ability to become whatever the situation calls for – become fat cells. “When we deleted Mitch from the progenitor cells, we discovered that the environment created in these cells was not conducive to the synthesis of new fats,” Gross explained. “Reducing the ability to synthesize membranes prevents the cells from growing, developing and reaching the point where differentiation is possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is this the dawn of a new next-gen obesity treatment? Well, let’s not get ahead of ourselves here: gene therapy is rare outside of &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/gene-therapy/about/pac-20384619" target="_blank"&gt;very specific scenarios&lt;/a&gt; – and frankly, “I want to lose weight” is unlikely to qualify. Plus, you might not like the side effects of deleting Mitch from your life – &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep44401" target="_blank"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, Gross’s team linked deletion of the protein to the loss of important cognitive functions including spatial memory, learning ability, and severe Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, what this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; is a new step on the road to better understanding obesity, and potentially towards a new approach to &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/not-just-for-weight-loss-glp-1-drugs-may-affect-addiction-and-dementia-risk-77698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;treating it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[F]at accumulation requires a large amount of available energy, but in cells without Mitch, there is a shortage of energy,” Gross summarized. “In addition, the expression of genes necessary for differentiation is suppressed, and there is a shortage of the substances vital for this process to occur. As a result, differentiation of new fat cells is reduced, along with fat accumulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In other words, we showed that Mitch determines the fate of fat in human cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00335-7" target="_blank"&gt;The EMBO Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 03:57:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQMWdsYWxYVThUaEVxSlVaQ21ERnJxVllHdDJ3TU00bjF4Zk9ZWjJXVk9vVm9MVE8wX3A4ZXU1ZjdxbFNybGNKMEpJTDhQTlpNQkp3SlZwU3NTazF4Y2Y4SzdZcDhEZktpSk9kbGdlYXhybWNxeWEySmQ2RGlnaUJyd0o4VWpXcTRxZGt0UGFsZFA3SzdjRm44TkhLWVdwWk54V3BMZQ</guid></item><item><title>关于FDA批准的首例家用子宫颈抹片检查的须知-《华盛顿邮报》 | What to know about the first at-home Pap smear approved by the FDA - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQcTdOUTVaelB4OUJTYnEzVmd0a05GUEZVZE0xNDdfdmtyZHhmQzNFMHN1MG5ZSlhYUG1mekRmVmFhQ1dkX2huWGVRUDh5STZHLS1jdy14TEtzODlmZWltajF1YmxmS2xiVm5aNjU1TjZXUUpKcjRDV0ozT1NUUXJlOXVla21ENnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X6VZUAW6DN1F77P5VXN3PEXZ3W" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration approved the first at-home screening tool to detect cervical cancer, offering &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/05/15/cervical-cancer-hpv-screening-test/"&gt;an alternative to the traditional Pap smear&lt;/a&gt; typically performed in a doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MHXA25KAIZDENDVE6TRPXWAGK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The wand developed by Teal Health allows patients to self-collect a vaginal sample and mail it to a lab for testing.

&lt;p&gt;For decades, Alzheimer’s disease has been seen as a one-way road, a slow but inevitable decline in memory and thinking. But new research out of Harvard is beginning to challenge that assumption. A 2024 study suggests that with targeted lifestyle changes, it may be possible to reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms in the early stages, though &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/researchers-found-a-way-to-switch-memories-back-on-in-alzheimers-patients/"&gt;the cure&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a one-size-fits-all kind of deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-024-01482-z"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s Research &amp;amp; Therapy&lt;/em&gt;, followed 50 people with early-stage Alzheimer’s over the course of 20 weeks. Instead of using medication, participants adopted a program focused on a plant-based diet, regular exercise, better sleep habits, and stress reduction. By the end of the study, many showed measurable improvements in cognitive tests. Some even regained skills like remembering names or following conversations.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To get significant results in just 20 weeks, in just 50 patients, only altering lifestyle — to be very honest, was shocking to me,” said senior author Rudolph Tanzi, a Harvard Medical School professor, in a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/07/alzheimers-study-finds-diet-lifestyle-changes-yield-improvements/"&gt;recent statement&lt;/a&gt;. The findings raise the possibility that lifestyle changes alone could help reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms before the disease progresses too far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="is-wp-image-block wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all" alt="MRI of alzheimer's disease" class="is-wp-image-block wp-image-5968984" srcset="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?quality=82 6000w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;amp;quality=82 150w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;amp;quality=82 300w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;amp;quality=82 768w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;amp;quality=82 1024w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;amp;quality=82 1536w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;amp;quality=82 2048w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=63%2C42&amp;amp;quality=82 63w" sizes="(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="is-wp-image-block wp-element-caption"&gt;An MRI showing Alzheimer’s disease in the brain. Image source: Atthapon/Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key factor is insulin resistance, which affects the brain’s ability to process energy. By shifting to a ketogenic or Mediterranean-style diet, participants improved their brain’s energy metabolism. This, in turn, may reduce inflammation and support neural function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.&lt;/h4&gt;	&lt;p class="signup-form-info"&gt;Sign up for the most interesting tech &amp;amp; entertainment news out there.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;p class="signup-form-tos"&gt;By signing up, I agree to the &lt;a rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.com/terms-of-use/" target="_blank"&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt; and have reviewed the &lt;a rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank"&gt;Privacy Notice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;span class="success hidden text-white font-bold items-center"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other interventions focused on correcting nutritional deficiencies linked to cognitive decline to try to reverse Alzheimer’s progress. Low levels of vitamin B12, vitamin D, and glutathione, for example, have all been associated with increased Alzheimer’s risk. Improved sleep and regular physical activity also boost blood flow to the brain and promote synaptic health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not every case of Alzheimer’s will respond the same way. The study was relatively small, and most participants had sporadic (non-genetic) Alzheimer’s, which is more likely to be influenced by environmental and lifestyle factors. Experts caution that more research is needed before these findings can be broadly applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this study offers hope and a practical direction. If you or a loved one is &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/this-ai-can-tell-if-you-might-develop-alzheimers-just-by-hearing-you-speak/"&gt;facing early-stage Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, it’s worth exploring lifestyle changes under a doctor’s guidance. A diet rich in greens and omega-3s, regular movement, and solid sleep habits could do more than just slow symptoms. It might help reverse Alzheimer’s progression altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-septenary-background-color has-background is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain-music synchronization:&lt;/strong&gt; Your brain doesn’t just predict music patterns—it physically synchronizes with them through neural oscillations that affect your entire body.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stability creates preference:&lt;/strong&gt; Musical sounds with simple frequency relationships (like perfect fifths) create more stable neural patterns, explaining why certain combinations sound pleasant across cultures.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural attunement:&lt;/strong&gt; While some aspects of music perception are universal, your brain becomes “attuned” to the music you frequently hear, explaining cultural preferences while maintaining recognition of basic musical structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STORRS, Conn. — &lt;/strong&gt;Music makes us tap our feet and feel emotions without us consciously deciding to do so. But why? According to fascinating research, it’s not just about your brain predicting what comes next in a song – it’s about actual physical patterns forming in your neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A team of international scientists, led by Edward Large from the University of Connecticut, have discovered that our &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain cells&lt;/a&gt; physically synchronize with musical sounds, creating stable patterns that affect our entire body. Their research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-025-00915-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Reviews Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, introduces what they call &lt;strong&gt;neural resonance theory&lt;/strong&gt;, or NRT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We propose that people anticipate musical events not through predictive neural models, but because brain-body dynamics physically embody musical structure,” the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This represents a fundamental shift in how we understand &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/music/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;music processing&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than simply making predictions, our neural circuits form physical relationships with music through rhythmic oscillations that synchronize with what we hear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you tap your foot to a song, it happens because neural oscillations in your brain &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/brains-sync-music/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lock into rhythm&lt;/a&gt; with the music, creating stable patterns that naturally extend to your body movements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These synchronization patterns occur at different speeds in the brain. For rhythm (like drumbeats), slower brain waves lock to rhythmic frequencies. For pitch (musical notes), the inner ear and brainstem process faster frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-missing-beat-phenomenon"&gt;The Missing Beat Phenomenon&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One remarkable discovery involves “missing pulse” rhythms – complex patterns without any actual sound at the beat frequency. Despite nothing being played at the pulse frequency, people still perceive and move to the beat. NRT explains this through nonlinear resonance, where brain oscillators generate frequencies not present in the original signal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The theory also helps explain why certain musical combinations sound pleasant or harsh. Simple frequency relationships (like the perfect fifth) create more stable neural oscillation patterns than complex ones. This stability translates into what we experience as pleasant sounds, while instability feels discordant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is Neural Resonance Theory?&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neural Resonance Theory (NRT) is a scientific approach that explains how your brain processes music using fundamental physics principles rather than abstract predictions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, NRT suggests that:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your brain contains billions of neurons that naturally oscillate (rhythmically fire) at different frequencies&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When you hear music, these neural oscillations physically synchronize with the sound waves&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This synchronization creates stable patterns in your brain that correspond to musical elements&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The more stable these patterns are, the more pleasant or “right” the music feels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional theories that say your brain is constantly making predictions about what comes next in music, NRT proposes that your brain actually embodies the music’s structure through its own physical patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This physical synchronization explains why music can directly affect your movements and emotions without conscious thought—your brain and body are literally vibrating in harmony with the music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-culture-and-music-wired-by-experience"&gt;Culture and Music: Wired by Experience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cultural background plays a significant role too. While certain aspects of music perception may be universal due to basic brain physics, cultural exposure strengthens specific neural connections through a process called “attunement.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This mechanism helps explain why people &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/see-the-same-things-music/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;from different cultures&lt;/a&gt; have different musical preferences while still recognizing basic musical structures – our brains become attuned to the music we frequently hear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the way &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/musicians/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;musicians&lt;/a&gt; anticipate each other when playing together fits this model. The researchers found that feedback loops within neural systems can cause anticipatory synchronization – explaining how musicians seem to play “ahead” of each other yet remain perfectly coordinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors explain that “the interaction of certain kinds of sounds with ongoing pattern-forming dynamics results in patterns of perception, action and coordination that we collectively experience as music.” This approach bridges both universal elements of music found across cultures and the variations in musical systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s clear is that when we &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/music/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;share music&lt;/a&gt; — whether at backyard barbecues, holiday gatherings, or road trips with the radio blaring — we’re doing something deeply meaningful. Our brains are literally synchronizing, creating shared neural patterns across generations and differences. In those moments when everyone finds themselves humming the same chorus or tapping to the same beat, we’re experiencing one of life’s simplest yet most profound connections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a comprehensive survey of existing literature on the neuroscience of music, examining neural mechanisms involved in perception of pitch, harmony, melody, tonality, rhythm, meter, groove, and affect. They analyzed this empirical data through the lens of neural resonance theory (NRT), which applies principles from nonlinear dynamics and oscillatory networks. The paper integrates findings from behavioral studies, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional MRI, and computational modeling to develop a coherent theoretical framework that explains how neural dynamics create musical experiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors found that neural oscillations synchronize with musical stimuli across multiple timescales. At slower timescales, cortical oscillations lock to rhythmic patterns, explaining phenomena like pulse and meter perception. At faster timescales, oscillations in the auditory periphery and brainstem process pitch relationships. The research indicates that stability of neural resonance predicts musical structures across cultures, with more stable resonance patterns (simple integer frequency ratios) being more common in music worldwide. The model successfully explains phenomena like missing pulse perception, groove, consonance/dissonance, and anticipatory synchronization between musicians.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledge that application of dynamical systems to cognitive neuroscience of music is still developing. Further empirical evidence is needed to directly compare behavioral and neural predictions across timescales. More work is also needed to distinguish between NRT and other approaches like predictive coding models. Future research should examine cross-cultural musical corpora guided by dynamical predictions and investigate individual variations in musical perception and performance abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

and those with weak immune systems, according to lead author Professor Dong Keon Yon from the Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without vaccination, about 30% of people may develop shingles in their lifetime, Yon noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In addition to the rash, shingles has been linked to a higher risk of heart problems, so we wanted to find out if getting vaccinated could lower this risk," he said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study suggests that the shingles vaccine may help lower the risk of heart disease, even in people without known risk factors.

People who drank less tended to lose a little more weight, the researchers noted, possibly because they were cutting back on alcohol's empty calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The significance of this has to be taken into context of what's available to treat alcohol use disorder," Dr. Maurice O'Farrell, lead author of the study and founder of the Medication Weight Loss Clinic in Dublin, Ireland, told ABC News. "The real advantage that this medication has is compliance, and what this medication does is it gives people a degree of control, it gives the concrete guardrails, and that is something that is completely unique."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scientists have been studying other possible health benefits of GLP-1s besides diabetes management and weight loss for this class of medication, which includes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, in the wake of their booming popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Prior studies and anecdotal reports from patients have hinted that these medications may help cut cravings for alcohol and other addictive substances. One possible explanation is that they act on parts of the brain that control reward and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to the study, GLP-1 drugs may affect brain chemicals tied to pleasure and fullness, though more research is needed to fully understand the exact mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"They attenuate dopamine release in reward pathways, and these pathways are common to food satisfaction but also to the pleasure people get from alcohol," O'Farrell said. "They drink more slowly and also the gastric emptying is slowed -- that means the absorption of alcohol is slower, so it is less pleasurable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Because this study took place in a real-world clinical setting -- not a controlled lab -- it may better reflect how people actually drink alcohol in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But the study did have a few limitations. There was no control group for comparison and researchers relied on people to report their own drinking habits, which they don't always remember accurately. About a third of the participants didn't complete the study, which makes the results less certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If these results are confirmed in larger studies, O'Farrell said he thinks they could offer a new way to help people cut back on alcohol, especially those who haven't had success with current treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Dr. Keerthana Pakanati is a Cardiovascular Disease Fellow at Virginia Mason Franciscan Health and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 22:28:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNemFENlhwdnNWQmJleTRWMlBmYnJ4Z1JyZjI5QXdIdldDSG1TTmZjUFJJeXBRWnBYZ1JnUGhibmdRVFVtOE84bTBJUHp1aEFqVlpQUG1rc3hLOEJiMkMxMmlOZFd1UWdBbnRUYk1vNFIyWHFXVFM5S0MxYXFSVmE0WTlxRkttTHdnSllabHNlZmV1cEtNQ1VwVG83b3JfSmpiSTAzRDBVenVid9IBrwFBVV95cUxPRlJScjdnel9qS2NSOVBfZ0ZYLTlqTjd2Q1Fhb0FKamxTMEZ1NnoydTJ4TU81Umo2RVZxajR3ZW1SNzVlVEVWamx1eDBZRnB3WVFaWTFHTXRwdWdGUXNQTzRyUnFjeTRMUjkxdzFySjE0SEwxMkk3RHMyd0NWSHJQeFYxWDBRMm9TcGotR2F4S0VUNHRqMjk5bk43bUo1aEIyQnJwaEFjeldkSlRXOHQw</guid></item><item><title>现在，这种疫苗也可以让你免于心脏病-金钱谈新闻 | Now This Vaccine Could Spare You From Heart Disease, Too - Money Talks News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNX2ZxU3c2dDk2Njg1X1EyTjNkZWxYd0hmb2RsVElWVVljV1FDT2t6RTdUOGNpazhTRzg4R0xJVDBrVVY1YXlSOGV3S2xTN1FHaXBLbmUwc0JXbVUzbHFYVEI0OThRZmtCTUFsbmp6Y1U2c0tUSFNTdGhhLW1pXzVVTkd6LVFrWkZrMDI1a2k2enBDR3ZPY1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Money Talks News</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 22:24:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNX2ZxU3c2dDk2Njg1X1EyTjNkZWxYd0hmb2RsVElWVVljV1FDT2t6RTdUOGNpazhTRzg4R0xJVDBrVVY1YXlSOGV3S2xTN1FHaXBLbmUwc0JXbVUzbHFYVEI0OThRZmtCTUFsbmp6Y1U2c0tUSFNTdGhhLW1pXzVVTkd6LVFrWkZrMDI1a2k2enBDR3ZPY1E</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic上的人们喝得很少- Gizmodo | People on Ozempic Are Drinking Way Less - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5qZVlpOHFDWEh0dFZZaWNBVXFqUHRlNmtZZmhKQ01TRXYzZ3ljUFEzNjFoYUpLZzZNRW9DLTRmYnRoTU1Ybk95TjN1RjNpRnRDSktPamNIS2tXUWVaV1doY2dqQ2pEVDlJTWZwdEJnaGh3YUtSLW03UmZn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Ozempic and similar drugs aren’t just for weight loss, more and more research is finding. New data is the latest to show that GLP-1 medications help lower people’s alcohol consumption, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in Ireland and Saudi Arabia conducted the study, which involved around 200 patients who were prescribed GLP-1 drugs to manage their obesity. They found that people not only lost weight on the drugs, they also tended to reduce their alcohol intake—by up to two-thirds for those who drank the most beforehand. The findings strengthen the case for GLP-1s as an addiction treatment, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and similar GLP-1 drugs are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/semaglutide-tirzepatide-weight-loss-drugs-future-uses-1851116318"&gt;far more effective&lt;/a&gt; at helping people lose weight than diet and exercise alone. But some scientists have also begun to notice that these drugs may help reduce people’s cravings for things besides food, including potentially harmful drugs like opioids, cocaine, and alcohol. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-case-for-ozempic-as-a-addiction-treatment-keeps-getting-better-2000513096"&gt;Early&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/glp-1-drugs-like-ozempic-reduce-cocaine-cravings-case-study-finds-2000565524"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/losing-weight-with-ozempic-might-also-lighten-your-bar-tab-study-finds-2000530051"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; started to support these anecdotal observations as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This new study was prospective, meaning the researchers proactively tracked how people’s alcohol use changed after starting GLP-1 therapy (many past similar studies were retrospective, which only look back in time). The study participants were real-life patients prescribed either semaglutide or liraglutide (an older GLP-1 drug) for weight loss. The participants reported their level of alcohol use before starting the drug, then were asked to come back for follow-up visits three and six months later.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Overall, 188 people returned for at least one follow-up visit. And people who drank alcohol reported drinking less on average after starting a GLP-1 drug. This reduction was especially apparent in those who drank the most to begin with: high consumers (defined as drinking over 11 drinks a week) reported a 68% reduction in their alcohol use, from around 23 drinks a week on average to 8 drinks weekly. That level of reduction is comparable to the effectiveness of existing treatments for alcohol use disorder, the study researchers note.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in alcohol intake among patients treated with GLP-1 RAs,” they wrote in their paper, which is set to be &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1083036"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; this weekend at the annual European Congress on Obesity. The findings were also &lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.16152"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study does have limitations, such as a lack of a control group and a relatively small sample size. There is also still some mystery as how exactly these drugs could affect drug cravings, though it’s suspected that GLP-1 receptors in the brain regulate our response to rewarding and potentially addictive stimuli like alcohol. But the evidence is mounting for GLP-1s having another life as a treatment for substance use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors note that there was a weak positive correlation between the amount of weight someone lost and how much less alcohol they consumed—a connection that makes sense, given how rich in calories alcoholic drinks tend to be. So at the very least, these drugs might serve a dual function for people struggling with their weight and their drinking habits at the same time, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for GLP-1 RAs in managing co-occurring obesity and alcohol use,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it will take randomized and controlled clinical trials to truly know whether semaglutide can become a reliable front-line option for substance use disorders, some of which are &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06015893?cond=Alcohol%20Use%20Disorder&amp;amp;intr=semaglutide&amp;amp;rank=4"&gt;already underway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

County each year, infected at least 138 people in 2024 and cases have remained unusually high so far in 2025. Officials say that levels of the virus in local wastewater suggest &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/diseases/hepa-data.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;these figures are an undercount&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-59aff52b"&gt;How is hepatitis A transmitted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The hepatitis A virus is spread through the so-called oral-fecal route, which means it is ingested through food or drinks that have been contaminated by microscopic bits of stool from an infected person. It can also spread through close contact with someone who is carrying the virus, even if they don’t show any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Unhoused people are often at greater risk of contracting hepatitis A because they have limited access to proper toilets and hand-washing facilities. The virus is also more common among travelers to places with poor sanitation, men who have sex with men and people who use drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But officials say many of the recent cases have occurred in people without those risk factors. They do not yet know why, but Dr. Timothy Brewer, an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist at U.C.L.A., said it had led him to worry about two things: &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/frozen-strawberries-2023/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;food contamination&lt;/a&gt;, and community circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“If you’re practicing good hygiene in a community that has access to potable water, you really should not be seeing a lot of this,” he said. “Something is going on — but exactly what that something is, we don’t yet know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

          &lt;p&gt;A starry sky can be stunning—even inside a hospital emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead of celestial bodies sparkling in the night, doctors in South Korea were gazing at bright brain lesions punctuating a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The resulting pattern, called a "starry sky," meant that their 57-year-old patient had a dangerous form of tuberculosis. The doctors &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2415077?logout=true"&gt;report the case&lt;/a&gt; in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man had previously been treated for the infection in his lungs but came into the hospital's emergency department after two weeks of unexplained headaches, neck pain, and tingling in his right hand. The MRI and Computed-Tomography (CT) scans clearly revealed the problem: rare nodules and lesions, called tuberculomas, speckling his lungs and central nervous system, including both cerebral hemispheres, the basal ganglia deep inside the brain, the cerebellum at the back of the brain, the brain stem, and the upper spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head with gadolinium enhancement revealed numerous small, spherical, peripherally enhancing nodules in the cerebral hemispheres (Panels A and B), basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brain stem, as well as in the upper spinal cord with surrounding edema (Panel C).

                      &lt;/a&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The condition, called CNS tuberculoma, is a relatively rare manifestation of tuberculosis, which typically infects the lungs but can invade any part of the body. It's unclear exactly how tuberculomas form, but evidence suggests that the bacteria that cause tuberculosis—&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis—&lt;/em&gt;can spread around the body via the blood. &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;M. tuberculosis &lt;/em&gt;can get past the blood-brain barrier, possibly by hiding inside a type of white blood cell called a macrophage, in a "Trojan horse" mechanism or by breaking through the barrier.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK585138/"&gt;Tuberculomas are thought to form&lt;/a&gt; when bacteria and macrophages clump together into masses that may contain calcifications or cheese-like dead tissue called caseum.&lt;/p&gt;
