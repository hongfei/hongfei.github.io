&lt;p&gt;Doctors soon discovered they were infected with the rare soil bacterium, which causes a disease called melioidosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dangerous infection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, melioidosis can be difficult to diagnose and tricky to treat, as it is naturally resistant to some antibiotics. It can infect people if they breathe it in or get it into open cuts. Sometimes the infection can stay localized, like a lung infection or a skin ulcer. But it can also get into the blood and become a systemic infection, spreading to various organs, including the brain. Fatality rates can be as high as 90 percent in people who are not treated but fall to less than 40 percent in people who receive prompt, proper care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both men in 2024 were quickly hospitalized and diagnosed with sepsis. Both were treated with heavy antibiotic regimens and recovered, though patient 2 relapsed in November, requiring another hospital stay. He ultimately recovered again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, about a dozen melioidosis cases are identified each year in the US on average, but most occur in people who have traveled to areas known to harbor the bacterium. Neither of the men infected last year had recently traveled to any such places. So the researchers turned to genetic sequencing, which revealed the link to two cases in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those cases, both men died from the infection. The man dubbed Patient 3 died in October of 1989. He was a veteran who fought in Vietnam—where the bacterium is endemic—two decades prior to his infection. The researchers note that such a long latency period for a &lt;em&gt;B. pseudomallei&lt;/em&gt; infection is not entirely out of the question, but it would be rare to have such a large gap between an exposure and an infection. More suspiciously, the researchers note that in the month prior to Patient 3's death, Hurricane Hugo made landfall in Georgia as a Category 4 storm, dumping three to five inches of rain.&lt;/p&gt;

However, now that he’s gone, Colleen has made it her mission to let people know that he did make a difference. A huge one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott grew up in Pocatello in the 1950s. At age 4, he went to bed one night a perfectly healthy, happy little boy. The next morning, he woke up unable to walk. His parents rushed him to St. Anthony Hospital, where doctors, fresh from training at a polio clinic back east, recognized the signs immediately. The polio virus had attacked the nerves in his legs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott was sent to the Elks Rehabilitation Center for Polio in Boise, where he was fitted with leg braces to help support his weight, and returned home. Despite this drastic and unexpected life change, his parents refused to treat him differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He was the youngest of five children,” Colleen said. “He was expected to do his chores just like his brothers and sister, behave appropriately, and not complain. He believed that made him the man he became — a regular person who just happened to have a disability.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott learned to live resourcefully at a young age. As a little boy, he sold worms, dug for Island Park fishermen, shined his brother’s shoes for a nickel, and fixed roller skates for neighborhood kids — all to buy small gifts for his mother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back then, Pocatello schools weren’t sure how to accommodate students with disabilities, and some people feared they might catch polio by touching someone who had survived it. Scott’s mother fought for her son’s right to an education. She eventually helped establish the Handicapped School at Idaho State University for Scott and many other students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott returned to public school in seventh grade, using his crutches and a wheelchair to get around. He went on to graduate from Highland High School’s very first graduating class in 1964, later enrolling at Idaho State University as an art major.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was only the beginning of his long list of accomplishments according to Colleen. Scott helped write Idaho’s Americans with Disabilities Act legislation and served on multiple state councils for people with disabilities. He directed a senior program in northern Idaho, traveling the state to set up meal services and secure financial help for seniors in need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later, he shifted gears into construction. For 34 years, he built and remodeled homes across northern Idaho doing much of the work crawling on the ground or from his wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He found a different way of solving problems. He kept a marble in his pocket while he was building houses. He put the marble on the floor to see if it rolled to determine if the floors were straight,” said Colleen. “He never let being in a wheelchair stop him from doing the things he wanted to do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He made friends with kids who had fast cars, hitching rides until he could afford his own vehicle. When he finally bought one, he retrofitted it with hand controls and drove it hunting and fishing in Island Park and throughout southeast Idaho. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of his greatest joys was riding his Honda Gold Wing motorcycle retrofitted so he could drive it from his wheelchair. &lt;/p&gt;

Seeing Scott Hancock riding a motorcycle from his wheelchair was a sight that turned heads but something that gave him much pleasure in life. | Courtesy photo &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He also wrote extensively, contributing to the Island Park News, Blackfoot Morning News and publishing in Idaho Magazine, American Motorcyclist and Sports Afield.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet he often dismissed his work as insignificant. “There are so many others who do a much better job,” he would say. “These are just silly little stories anyone could write.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was asked many times to write a book about his life, but always said, “Nobody would believe I really did those things.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the Hancocks eventually returned to southeast Idaho, settling in Blackfoot, Scott reluctantly “retired.” That’s when he began writing the “little stories” about his life that grew into two volumes of “Tales from the High Lonesome.” They were so well received that he began writing a third volume before his death.&lt;/p&gt;

She plans to combine Scott’s remaining writings into a fourth book, creating one final large collection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott’s books are available through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/tales-high-lonesome-scott-hancock/dp/b08gdkghl2"&gt;Amazon,&lt;/a&gt; Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and at Kesler’s Market in Blackfoot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/06/keslers-gives-local-authors-a-place-to-sell-books/"&gt;RELATED: Kesler’s gives local authors a place to sell books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Colleen emphasizes that writing was just a small part of Scott’s accomplishments and who he was. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He raised children who were not his own and loved them as if they were. He gave from his heart, made friends everywhere, and loved being with people,” said Colleen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Colleen, sharing Scott’s legacy is about honoring the impact he never fully saw in himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I am not the writer. My husband was. His story is one of resilience. I can only try to express what I saw and learned from him and share some of his dash with you,” Colleen concluded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3.jpg" class="fancybox"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-300x201.jpg" alt="Scott Hancock 1982 article" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-772270" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-300x201.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-768x514.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-860x575.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-748x500.jpg 748w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3-600x401.jpg 600w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scott-Hancock-3.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Where There’s a Will, There’s a Way.

            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on Friday reaffirmed support for Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy, becoming the second major professional medical association to break from current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations this week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00023b6nbr204xax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently removed its recommendation that pregnant and lactating individuals receive updated COVID-19 vaccines, ACOG’s recommendations have not changed,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care" target="_blank"&gt;updated practice advisory.&lt;/a&gt; “The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend the use of updated COVID-19 vaccines in individuals contemplating pregnancy and in pregnant, recently pregnant, and lactating individuals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00033b6n7el9lp07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In May, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-recommendation"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 vaccines will no longer be among the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/adult-medical-condition.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended vaccines for pregnant women&lt;/a&gt; and healthy children in CDC immunization schedules. The abrupt decision bypassed the government’s normal process for evaluating and recommending vaccines, and Kennedy did not offer scientific evidence to justify the change to the recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00043b6ntkupilfi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest recommendations from ACOG say that “all clinicians should provide a strong recommendation for updated COVID-19 vaccination to their pregnant and lactating patients.” Vaccinations can occur in any trimester, with an emphasis on the “earliest opportunity to maximize maternal and fetal health,” and any of the available Covid-19 vaccines can be delivered simultaneously with other vaccines recommended during pregnancy, includi﻿ng those against influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00053b6nug8ai2ro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dozens of references in ACOG’s advisory, including multiple CDC sources, emphasize the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy – and the increased risk that pregnant women and infants face from a Covid-19 infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00063b6nfu4bilae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, the American Academy of Pediatrics released its updated &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for vaccines with explicit support for Covid-19 vaccines for children and a direct criticism of a federal vaccine advisory committee, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, that AAP says is made up of “individuals who have a history of spreading vaccine misinformation” after it was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;recently overhauled&lt;/a&gt; by Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00073b6nbd5esv9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There has also been tension between ACOG and those driving federal health policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6z61o00003b6nw7dxr72s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The organization said it is no longer accepting federal funding due to recent changes that “significantly impact ACOG’s program goals, policy positions, and ability to provide timely and evidence-based guidance and recommendations for care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen71pbr00023b6neb8hu5fq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ﻿And ACOG &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/acog-to-release-recommendations-on-covid-19-vaccine-and-other-maternal-immunizations-in-concert-with-the-vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in July that it was partnering with an independent group of experts called the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/health/vaccine-information-project"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt; to develop maternal immunization guidance in the absence of “historically robust government-led annual review of data and subsequent evidence-based recommendations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00083b6n45x3mrlx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The meeting of the newly reconstructed Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) demonstrated that the committee did not follow the longstanding tradition of robust, unbiased review of reputable scientific evidence by medical and public health experts,” ACOG President Dr. Steven Fleischman &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/06/acog-asserts-that-data-presented-at-acip-support-maternal-immunization" target="_blank"&gt;said in June&lt;/a&gt;. “The data presented to ACIP affirm why ACOG continues to recommend safe, effective maternal vaccination. If ACIP responded to the data as presented in a way that values medical evidence and public health, the government’s recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy would be restored and support for maternal vaccination would be unwavering.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen6ac7n00093b6nqlqmylw9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the abrupt federal changes to the Covid-19 vaccination schedule, dozens of health and medical organizations – including ACOG and AAP – pushed for continued access and insurance coverage for the vaccines in an &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Pregnancy is still listed as a risk factor for severe illness from Covid-19 on the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, with multiple sources of evidence offering “conclusive increase in risk.”

            Pregnant women who have Covid-19 are more likely to require care in the ICU or on a ventilator, or to die, the medical organizations’ letter said, and they’re at higher risk of complications such as cesarean birth, preeclampsia or eclampsia, and blood clots. Infants born after a Covid-19 infection also face increased risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It is vital that we ensure that pregnant women continue to have access to this prevention tool so that they can protect themselves and their young infants, a vulnerable group who is not yet eligible for vaccination,” the letter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            HHS did not respond directly on ACOG’s recommendations or the evidence behind them. Instead, an agency spokesperson said in a statement that “HHS and CDC will continue to be the official resource for any guidance.”

&lt;p&gt;MaineHealth Maine Medical Center in Portland has struggled in recent years to keep bats from getting into the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit, prompting a complaint last year to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospital officials said on Thursday they are currently addressing the “occasional incursions from bats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite efforts to control bats at the Coulombe Family Tower, where the NICU and the critical care nursery are located, hospital officials confirmed there have been seven bat sightings this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees filed an OSHA complaint about the bats in June 2024 and since then the hospital has launched numerous measures to keep them from getting into the hospital. This includes replacing the facade at the Coulombe Family Tower, John Porter, MaineHealth spokesperson, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="exco-adslot" class="opscoad-exco-adslot" data-unit="/6119/pressherald.com/life/health"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OSHA complaint has since been resolved, Porter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“OSHA accepted MaineHealth Maine Medical Center’s corrective action plan. No fine was issued, and required notices were posted,” Porter said in the statement. An OSHA official on Friday confirmed that the hospital addressed the complaint and the case is closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Porter said “there have been no known bites of patients or staff” and that “every bat caught has been tested for rabies and they all have been negative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No patients or workers were tested for rabies, Porter said, because “there have been no instances where testing a person for rabies was advisable or necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last known human case of &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/news/maine-cdc-shares-tips-prevent-getting-rabies-bats-thu-07312025-1200"&gt;rabies in Maine was reported in 1937&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Ten captured bats tested positive statewide for rabies in 2024, according to the latest statistics available from the Maine CDC. Tests of the bats captured at Maine Med were conducted by Maine CDC labs, Porter said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
&lt;p&gt;A Maine Med nurse with direct knowledge of the situation told the Press Herald that workers have complained about bats in the Coulombe Family Tower for years, but that hospital officials were slow to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employee asked to remain anonymous over concerns she would be retaliated against by hospital management for speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do think they are working on resolving it now, after the OSHA complaint, but they were slow in starting to do anything about it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A June 2024 letter from MaineHealth to OSHA, dated about a week after the complaint was filed, noted problems with bats going back to 2023. Bat incursions into the hospital accelerated in 2024 — with six sightings — and was likely related to bats getting in at the site of where building repairs were being done at the tower, according to the letter, obtained by the Press Herald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Press Herald shared a copy of the letter on Thursday with Porter, who said in the statement that “in addition to on-going pest-mitigation work by contractors, MaineHealth Maine Medical Center is currently undergoing a façade renovation project in the Coulombe Family Tower, which should also address bat incursions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employee said MaineHealth should have notified the public about the bat problem, “especially since we are talking about newborn babies.”&lt;/p&gt;

The tower has been infiltrated by bats. (Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer) &lt;span class="credit"&gt; &lt;i&gt;Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porter, explaining why the public wasn’t notified last year, said that MaineHealth “relies upon regulatory agencies,” including OSHA, to “determine what disclosures are required for its care team, patients and the public when an incident of this nature occurs. MaineHealth has complied fully with those requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the June 2024 letter from MaineHealth to OSHA, the hospital protected patients by temporarily closing a portion of the critical care nursery, which is a unit where babies need specialized care but are in a condition that is not as severe as babies in the neonatal intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other steps included sealing various areas to prevent bats from entering and pest control measures, including disinfecting and monitoring areas where bats could get in, such as heating and air conditioning ductwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porter said the hospital responded in 2024 “by moving staff and patients and working with contractors to minimize intrusions by bats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measures to control bats are ongoing, Porter said, as the hospital “continues to take all necessary steps to mitigate the problem and protect patients and care team members in cooperation with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bat populations in the Northeast have rebounded in recent years, after bats learned to better avoid places where a fungus grew that was reducing their populations in the 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2023, she suffered a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated by her neighbors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the reason for the episode remains unknown (at least to Chapman-Hart), she believes that a significant part of her medical problems could have been avoided if doctors had listened to what she was saying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There’s been a lack of accountability,” she claimed. And while noting that she did not wish to call out those responsible, there is a lot that can be learned from the experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s so that we can learn. There’s no funding for research, but we are research. Our lived experience is research – capture it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chiari malformation type 1 is extremely rare&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chiari malformation type 1 is the most common of the four main variants of the disorder and is usually the result of the skull being too small for the brain, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6008-chiari-malformation" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;according&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Kyushu University have demonstrated that yogurt intake increases the diversity of gut microbiota and alters its composition. Furthermore, bathing in chloride hot springs after yogurt intake was found to improve defecation status more than yogurt alone.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that combining two &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lifestyle+interventions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lifestyle interventions&lt;/a&gt;—yogurt intake and hot spring bathing—may contribute to better health, highlighting their potential application for preventive medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2025.1609102" target="_blank"&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a healthy gut environment is vital for overall health, as it plays a key role in regulating digestion, immune responses, and even neurological function. Yogurt, which contains prebiotic microorganisms such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lactic+acid+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lactic acid bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and bifidobacteria, has been known to modulate the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+microbiota/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; and provide a range of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, researchers at Kyushu University focused on Japanese &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hot+springs/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hot springs&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Onsen. "We have previously reported the beneficial effects of onsen bathing on the gut microbiota. However, little has been known about how the combination of diet and onsen bathing influences health," says Professor Shunsuke Managi of Kyushu University's Urban Institute, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Therefore, we collaborated with Beppu City here in Kyushu, a region well known for its onsen, to investigate the effects of onsen bathing after yogurt intake."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;This study enrolled 47 healthy adult men and women who had not bathed in onsens within 14 days prior to the start of the trial. The participants were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/control+group/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;control group&lt;/a&gt;, a yogurt group, and a yogurt plus onsen group.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control group received no intervention, while the yogurt group consumed 180 g of low-sugar yogurt containing Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus after dinner daily. In addition to this, the yogurt plus onsen group bathed in Beppu's chloride spring for more than 15 minutes at least once every two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before and after the four-week intervention period, gut microbiota surveys were conducted using &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stool+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stool samples&lt;/a&gt;, and a questionnaire on defecation status containing 14 items which included evaluating stool frequency, stool consistency, the sensation of incomplete evacuation, and the use of laxatives was administered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results revealed a significant increase in gut microbiota diversity in the yogurt group, accompanied by changes in the relative abundance of multiple bacterial species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, these microbial changes were not observed in either the control group or the yogurt plus onsen group. However, both the yogurt group and the yogurt plus onsen group demonstrated significant improvements in defecation status scores, with the latter showing a more pronounced effect.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that yogurt intake may enhance gut microbial diversity, and that its combination with onsen bathing may exert an additive or synergistic effect to improve defecation status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although the sample size is small, our findings suggest that combining two accessible lifestyle interventions—&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/yogurt/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt; intake and onsen &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bathing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bathing&lt;/a&gt;—may offer enhanced health benefits, particularly by promoting gut microbiota diversity and improving defecation status in healthy adults," explains Managi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results are especially relevant given the growing interest in non-pharmaceutical, lifestyle-based strategies for preventive health and wellness. Furthermore, this research may support the development of evidence-based wellness tourism, particularly in regions known for their onsen, by providing scientific validation for health-oriented travel and services."&lt;/p&gt;

According to the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-3e5e8820-7f71-11f0-bca3-b723b3cc772e"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, this is the highest number of cases of the disease since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During that year, there were 279 congenital &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12722117/Rates-syphilis-babies-risen-decade-record-high-CDC-report.html"&gt;syphilis-related stillbirths&lt;/a&gt; and infant deaths. Of those, 252 were stillbirths, an increase of 6.3 percent since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the national congenital syphilis (CS) rate of 105.8 cases per 100,000 live births in 2023 represents a three percent increase from 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believe the rise is being driven by pregnant women not receiving prenatal care and testing, as well as not following up with treatment after testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women’s sexual partners who don’t receive &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13029481/America-std-crisis-syphilis-rates-highest-level.html"&gt;sexually transmitted disease&lt;/a&gt; (STD) screening or treatment also contribute to the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forty-three percent of birth parents did not receive syphilis testing during their pregnancy and 23 percent were not treated for a positive case. This contributed to almost 90 percent of congenital syphilis cases across the US in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most recently, New York recorded three deaths from CS, but it isn’t the only state with increasing rates of both syphilis and congenital syphilis. The nation’s top five syphilis hot spots include South Dakota, New Mexico, Mississippi, Arizona, and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cases of congenital syphilis have more than tripled in recent years, with 3,882 cases reported in 2023 (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These also have the highest rates of CS per 100,000 live births, according to the most recent CDC data. New York was ranked 40th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The third infant death marked the 21st case reported in New York counties this year, excluding New York City. There were 35 cases in New York City in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, New York state officials are calling for mandatory blood test screenings for pregnant mothers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York State Health Commissioner Dr James McDonald said in a statement last week: ‘No baby should die from syphilis in New York State or anywhere in this country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Detecting syphilis early in pregnancy with a simple blood test is important to ensure rapid diagnosis and treatment, so you have a healthy baby.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syphilis is an STD that causes skin rashes and sores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primary syphilis sores begin at the infection site such as the mouth or genitals. Secondary syphilis rashes appear on the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Congenital syphilis is passed from the pregnant mother to the fetus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection can cause symptoms such as bone deformities, jaundice, rashes and lesions. There are an estimated 1.5million cases of congenital syphilis each year, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, both syphilis and CS are preventable by using condoms during sex and can be treated by the antibiotic penicillin. When left untreated, CS can lead to neurological problems, premature and stillbirths, and afterbirth death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a visualization through 2022 of CS cases in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health agencies have recommendations for syphilis testing, providing self or at-home STD tests to expand the options for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every state recommends a test in the first trimester, 18 states recommend it for the third, and nine recommend it post-birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only eight states mandate syphilis screenings after delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sharon Nachman, Chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Disease at Stony Brook Children’s Hospital in New York, told DailyMail.com: ‘The problem is the pregnant patients receiving prenatal care that don’t follow up or show for their appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We don’t know if you were tested and perhaps tested positive for syphilis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women who aren’t screened is another concern. They could be asymptomatic or have no access to STI screening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 40 percent of pregnant women who tested positive did not receive any or adequate treatment, according to new CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only cure for congenital syphilis is the antibiotic benzathine penicillin, which is administered by injection. And it's currently facing a worldwide shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman explained that benzathine penicillin is an older generic drug that is produced less: ‘No new companies want to make benzathine penicillin.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The production of the antibiotic generates unwanted secondary products, such as bacterial residue, which are classified as hazardous waste. These byproducts are toxic and pose risks to the environment and the manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a visualization of missed opportunities to detect CS cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘If the byproducts making it are toxic, then even the generic companies won't and don’t want to make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘To build a plant that has a byproduct that is difficult to get rid of, and the medicine you are making costs pennies, then there is no profit in making it for you.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman explained that institutions like Stony Brook Hospital have a small amount of the drug and reserve it for pregnant women only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: ‘Any hospital that doesn’t have it on hand reaches out to other hospitals in their network to see if they can ship it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman said: ‘Of course this [shortage] is contributing to women not following up and receiving their medications, so those babies are born with syphilis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Congenital syphilis rates are higher in certain racial and ethnic groups. Infectious disease specialist Dr Carla Garcia Carreno of Children’s Health of Dallas, Texas, told DailyMail.com: ‘Over the years we have seen that the African American population is the most affected.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There may be some decreased access to contraceptive methods for that particular population.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest rates are in American Indians, Alaska Natives, Black and Hispanic populations, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Barriers like limited healthcare access, lack of preventative resources, limited insurance, and trouble reaching testing sites fuel the increase in cases among these groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nachman stressed that pregnant moms aren't the only ones who should be STD screened. Their partners risk syphilis reinfection, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘Remember testing pregnant women is only part of the battle. If you don’t test and treat their partners too, they can certainly get reinfected.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 16:40:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>性忠告：我丈夫和朋友一起出轨了。它使我们的性生活比以往任何时候都更好。- Slate</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOa05kd29WcEdzR2Fhci1aOG1UeUhvdDNxcUxxbS1wOWVsVE5BQXljb3E0Q3dlZFA2WmxveV9XakV2cTdHa3hqb0RjMURTaGZkNEUwdWd3eTk5U2xlZWlPS2FCOXdzT0tEU2d5d1YwcFdHRE5YS2FCQzJ5c0hfVzE5VFd4cy0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj3e001i3b6j8iiulabp@published"&gt;I am married and I have a close friend that is single. The other night, my husband, my friend, and I were drinking at my house. I had enough to drink and I told my friend I was sleepy. She told me to go to sleep. She did not have to tell me twice, I got up and went to bed and left her with my husband.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="160" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj3y001n3b6j17q3ig9q@published"&gt;Later, I woke up and lay in bed. I could hear noises, like moaning and heavy breathing on the other side of the wall. I just listened and did not move. I realized I was turned on by this. It stopped, and my husband walked into our room to check on me. He goes out again and I can hear the noises again. Before this, my sexual drive for my husband was out. But now every time we get together I’m aroused again. What he and my friend did was wrong and I am not sure how many times they have done this with me knocked out in the other room. But it has also made a difference in our sex life. I have not confronted him or my friend, who by the way I work with. I have thought about just calling him out and not saying anything to my friend because this would impact our relationship at work.&lt;/p&gt;

It sounds like you’d like to indulge more in the &lt;a href="https://www.victoriamilan.com/landers/cuckquaen-guide/"&gt;cuckquean lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, which involves deriving sexual pleasure by watching (or hearing) your partner have sex with others. It can be a form of voyeurism and it’s a pretty common sexual fantasy. This practice can include encouraging your partner to pursue it actively, or it can be just one that you participate in alone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj42001r3b6jyackk8bd@published"&gt;You can pursue &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-voyeurism#when-it-becomes-a-problem"&gt;voyeurism responsibly&lt;/a&gt; by watching porn and role-playing, but it crosses the line when someone has not consented to be involved. While it’s sexy to hear your husband doing someone else, how would the other woman feel if she didn’t know someone was listening in for their own sexual enjoyment?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj5400273b6jooi9cp8l@published"&gt;Before confronting your husband, think about what you’d like to address. Is it the fact that he cheated and slept with your friend? Do you want an explanation? Or is it that you know and would like him to continue this behavior (with consent from all parties) but with more structure and rules, for example, a rule stating he can’t sleep with your co-workers? Know what resolution you’re looking for—setting some boundaries will make it less likely he’ll run to your friend, which can prevent the very awkwardness you’re trying to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj4t00203b6jehguuges@published"&gt;Last year, we moved into a new house with excellent water pressure. Like almost pressure washer pressure. And using the handheld showerhead, I’ve found that extremely hot, extremally focused water jets spraying on my testicles is one of the most intense pleasurable experiences of my life. It’s not orgasmic, per se, but it feels really, really good - the point I kind of zone out and lose track of time. I know this is bad for my water bill, but my question is more basic: How do I recreate this sensation in the bedroom? My wife and I are approaching 20 years of marriage, and while we have a good sex life, it’s not particularly adventuresome. Shower sex is likely not in the scenario. Any advice? Toys? I feel like finding a solution for this problem will be helping me not only have a more pleasurable experience, but will also be good for the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

Or consider the &lt;a href="https://www.womanizer.com/us/womanizer-wave"&gt;Womanizer Wave showerhead&lt;/a&gt; which claims to reduce water use by 60 percent, though that won’t help you out in the actual bedroom but might get at some of that guilt about wasting water. Friend of the column Sonja Vitow suggests a Waterpik with the tonsil stone attachment. But I’d add a waterproof sheet or mattress protector if you decide to bring it into the bedroom. Or start experimenting with other sensations that your testes might find tantalizing that might not involve water but could include just about any other form of touch you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;

That said, I have a problem. Sometimes, when I have an intense orgasm, I have what I can only describe as a brain disconnect after. There have been a couple times when I cannot talk. I will try, but all that comes out is gibberish. I have also had panic attacks. It doesn’t happen every time I have an intense orgasm, but when it does it’s pretty scary. Is this a normal reaction to intense orgasms, or is it something I should be worrying about?&lt;/p&gt;

If it were, it’d have been captured, commodified, and turned into a subgenre of porn already (the closest example to a reference in popular culture that comes to mind is when Missy Elliott said, “Sex me so good I say blah-blah-blah” in “Work It”).&lt;/p&gt;

Reinert is a gynecologist in Los Angeles who I reached out to after reading a paper she co-wrote, “&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28454896?dopt=Abstract"&gt;‘Did You Climax or Are You Just Laughing at Me?’ Rare Phenomena Associated With Orgasm&lt;/a&gt;,” which ran in the Sexual Medicine Reviews journal in 2017 and documents instances of rare peri-orgasmic phenomena reported in medical literature and via colleagues. (&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/lena-dunhams-hysterectomy-reminds-us-that-reproduction-still-evades-our-control.html?via=recirc_recent"&gt;Reinert has also contributed to Slate&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj4q001z3b6j76uewqlg@published"&gt;“Without knowing more about this individual, I can say this: An orgasm involves diverse areas of the brain, and there are a variety of bizarre post-orgasmic phenomenon reported in the medical literature, many of which can be explained by our understanding of bodily representation within the brain, or of the neurochemical changes that occur with orgasm,” Reinert told me via email. “These phenomena are not common, so I wouldn’t describe them as ‘normal,’ but in general they are mostly harmless and just a side effect of how the brain is wired. Sex also raises a person’s heart rate and blood pressure, and can be a trigger for dangerous health events, so it’s important to make sure that weird symptoms are ‘just’ due to orgasm, and are not a sign of a stroke, heart attack, or brain aneurysm, for instance.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj4p001y3b6jv7ulezh1@published"&gt;Regarding your panic attacks, which Reinert’s aforementioned paper documents, she said: “Among individuals with a history of panic disorder, it has been reported that many experience panic attacks after orgasm; as with this individual, they do not typically occur with every orgasm, only a small percentage of them. If symptoms are sufficiently bothersome, an affected individual could talk with their doctor about medication to decrease the frequency of panic attacks (but medication side effects might cause more trouble for one’s sex life than did the panic attacks).”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeirhj4w00223b6jqizcoa6p@published"&gt;The speech symptoms are more concerning. “They sound like what is called Broca’s aphasia, which can be a sign of a stroke in the part of the brain responsible for production of language,” Reinert wrote. “Since this individual’s symptoms occur only immediately after orgasm and then spontaneously resolve, it’s not likely a stroke, but could be due to a seizure or transient ischemic attack in this brain area. It has been reported that some people experience seizures precipitated by orgasm. I would recommend that this person discuss these symptoms with their doctor and maybe a neurologist, in order to rule out a potentially dangerous underlying medical condition.”&lt;/p&gt;

(TNBC) is negative on tests for estrogen and progesterone receptors and doesn’t produce much HER2 protein, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/about/types-of-breast-cancer/triple-negative.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It “tends to grow and spread faster, has fewer treatment options, and tends to have a worse prognosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of a woman taking pills.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beta-blockers may be a promising treatment, the research shows. The way it works is a multi-step process: Stress hormones can activate a receptor called beta-2 adrenoceptor, which then causes two more molecules to speed up the cancer’s spread. The process is fueled by a gene, HOXC12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta-blockers can turn off this gene — effectively stopping the progression of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medication is most commonly prescribed to treat heart and circulatory problems, the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22318-beta-blockers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; explains. They work on beta receptors to slow your heart rate and blood pressure. One in 10 Americans take the medication, one of the most commonly prescribed in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If HOXC12 is found to be present in a TNBC patient, they could be an ideal candidate for beta blocker therapy,” &lt;a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/michelle-ellisdon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Associate Professor Michelle Halls;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Associate Professor Michelle Halls&lt;/a&gt; said in a press release from &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/new-study-uncovers-how-beta-blockers-could-halt-the-progression-of-triple-negative-breast-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Monash University.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Monash University.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added study author &lt;a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/lamterrance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Terrance Lam;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Terrance Lam&lt;/a&gt;, the first author, “Ultimately, this exciting discovery could pave the way to improving survival outcomes in people with TNBC when HOXC12 is found to be present. TNBC is an aggressive cancer which can be especially challenging to treat and identifying new treatment pathways are important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued: "We believe further studies are urgently needed to determine if HOXC12 can be used to identify patients who will benefit from beta blocker therapy at the time of diagnosis and stop tumor spread, thus increasing survival rates.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/beta-blockers-triple-negative-breast-cancer-tumors-11795502" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 15:05:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1LZ1FCa29RbUYzejgwS3E5UnVKQzJJc2NqMEpvazRDSWl2Q01GbmdoSlVkR1NLUFVvZ0toSk9sdG1HSWpWUW0zemlFN3ZnYmpMUnktbnpmcG9tWnZ6Mnp5d2p2Y29yUTNWdktCLTd1VzhOS295Tmc</guid></item><item><title>“隐藏”脂肪正在无声地使您衰老-科学家警告说，一种常见的体形风险最大-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxPTmJfT0hMRW5HNnp6ZUlmSC1PYkljV09EMl9HLVNmWFM4R05DV1BHb29GTHZoTzZmUkYwOGtsN1doV3M0UlN5dm1TeXpobkRtZVF5dHJzNWVraXhKZjFieXJ1bzRBUzQ4Qzl6UmNHRXctMnZVSm5UMmh2U1NsOFMzOUlRTk0zeHNLSEphQ1YtZ1BaTHI0dkFn0gGcAUFVX3lxTE9XTTl2WUYxd0wxbVpvTl9JeXZ1RDVScVlhRExLb18xeFdRV1RTUGxEang4SVUtYVNRRjVDMEFTY2JaUzlYUFB4a2VXTllQTTZPME5pTGRiQXVtMXNDVkxBMUY0NW9NYnA5OENjV3dEb0dZT3lHTDhMSkcwbGdnZUMyNW9TWU9tMUpkTEctZmJLS054NzZzamJWYmlCVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Slim people may still be at risk of a deadly heart attack—because of hidden fat that accelerates ageing of the heart, a major study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The dangerous fat—known as visceral fat—builds up deep inside the body, wrapping around the liver, stomach and intestines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike the fat you can see and pinch, it is invisible from the outside, meaning many people who appear slim may still be carrying harmful amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers analysed data from more than 21,000 people and found those with higher levels of visceral fat showed signs their hearts and blood vessels were ageing more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood tests revealed this type of fat also triggered inflammation throughout the body—a process long linked to premature ageing and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings, published in the European Heart Journal, also suggest that body shape may be more important than weight alone when it comes to heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men who carried fat around the belly in an 'apple-shaped' body type were much more likely to show accelerated heart ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By contrast, 'pear shaped' women genetically predisposed to storing fat around their hips and thighs—known as gluteofemoral fat—appeared to have healthier, younger hearts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Two MRI scans showing a person (left) with more visceral fat (in red) and subcutaeous fat (in blue)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The UK researchers measured the 'bad' fat around their organs by doing several MRI scans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This lower-body fat may even help guard against heart disease, strokes and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found that higher oestrogen levels in premenopausal women were linked to slower heart ageing—suggesting the hormone could play a protective role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reach their conclusions, scientists at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Medical Sciences in London analysed MRI scans from participants in the UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whole-body images were used to map the amount and location of fat, while detailed scans of the heart and blood vessels were assessed with artificial intelligence to detect signs of ageing—such as tissue becoming stiff or inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each participant was then given a 'heart age', which researchers compared with their actual age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Professor Declan O'Regan, from Imperial College London, said: 'We have known about the apple and pear distinction in body fat, but it hasn't been clear how it leads to poor health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our research shows that 'bad' fat, hidden deep around the organs, accelerates ageing of the heart. But some types of fat could protect against ageing—specifically fat around the hips and thighs in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also showed that BMI wasn't a good way of predicting heart age which underscores the importance of knowing where fat is stored in the body and not just total body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While some warning signs are easy to spot, such as severe chest pain, others are more vague and hard to pinpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The goal of our research is to find ways to increase healthy lifespan. While being active is important, we found that hidden fat could still be harmful even in fit people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His team now plans to investigate whether new weight-loss jabs such as Ozempic can target the ageing effects of this hidden fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs, which mimic the hunger-suppressing hormone GLP-1, have already been shown to cut levels of dangerous visceral fat—and could one day help keep the heart younger for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation added: 'We already know excess visceral fat around the heart and liver can lead to increased blood pressure and high cholesterol, so it is concerning that it could also help to speed up ageing of the heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As the pattern of fat distribution typically seen in women's bodies is linked to oestrogen, that hormone may be key to future therapies developed to tackle heart ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eating a healthier diet and becoming more active can help to reduce visceral fat levels.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this summer, US &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14955169/heart-ageing-faster-body-test.html"&gt;researchers &lt;/a&gt;developed a free online &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nwkhanlab.shinyapps.io/riskage/"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt; that they claim can help you calculate if your heart is aging faster than the rest of your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By utilising data provided by the American Heart Association it can help you better understand how much stress your heart is under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It asks you to enter your sex, age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, whether or not you have diabetes, and if you take medication for blood pressure or statins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also requires you to input your eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) which is used to measure how well your kidneys are functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The age calculator was tested on more than 14,000 US adults between the ages of 30 and 79 from the year 2011 up until 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can’t stop scrolling on TikTok? Tossing and turning through the night? Feel like you’re glued to the mattress when that 7:00 a.m. alarm starts ringing? We get it, and so does &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/TADRGPAJ/c/2385908/3131553/39186" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Ozlo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

About 50 to 70 million Americans suffer from sleep disorders, and 1 in 3 adults do not regularly get the recommended amount of uninterrupted sleep, according to a study published by the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/education-and-awareness/sleep-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National Institute of Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not just a personal problem. The rise of the “sleep divorce” speaks for itself; people are taking their slumber to separate rooms just to get some peace and quiet. With back-to-school around the corner (hello, roommates and exhausted parents), sleep may feel more important than ever. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More people are turning to sound-masking technology — like &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/TADRGPAJ/c/2385908/3131553/39186" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Ozlo Sleepbuds&lt;/a&gt;. These tiny buds were developed by former Bose engineers to block our real-life noise, whether it’s highway traffic, rowdy roommates, a snoring husband, or your buzzing brain. Best of all? Just in time for the start of the school year, Ozlo is offering $35 off a pair of their &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/TADRGPAJ/c/2385908/3131553/39186" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;best-selling buds&lt;/a&gt;, plus a free gift with your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in biometric sensors to detect when you fall asleep — and when it’s time to dim the noise that your streaming (via Bluetooth)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Comes with four sizes of soft silicone tips that are comfortable for most sleepers and stay secure in the ear, per many reviewers&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Wireless range of up to 10 feet from the included Smart Case&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Effectively blocks out sleep-disturbing noise, per many reviews&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;One-year warranty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires frequent charging (10 hours of playback per charge)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Ozlo, Sleepbuds might just give you the best sleep of your life. These little earbuds aren’t just designed to block out descriptions; they also replace the unwanted noise with what you want to stream (think a meditation or perhaps a podcast). Built-in biometric sensors detect when you nod off, automatically switch to soothing sleep sounds when you fall asleep. Pick from four ultra-soft silicone tips designed for all-night comfort, even if you sleep on your side. Sleepbuds are made for everyone, but personalized to your preferences. Whether you’re a lifelong light sleeper or just struggling to tune out noisy neighbors, these tiny buds have you covered. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;




&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hailed as a “miracle of engineering,” Sleepbuds pack advanced features into a tiny design to enhance your sleep. They offer 10 hours of battery life, biometric sensing, and Bluetooth streaming, so you can unwind with your favorite audiobook or meditation, fall asleep against soothing sounds designed by scientists, and wake gently with a personal in-ear alarm that won’t disturb your partner.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“After two years of sleeping with a partner who uses a CPAP and always feeling tired, now I say my goodnights, put in my sleep buds with waves, and don’t hear a thing until the alarm goes off in the morning! Life changer!” one happy reviewer exclaimed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are not your ordinary &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/sonos-ace-headphones-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;headphones&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-ear-plugs-per-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;earplugs&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;A discount? Well, for a limited time, they’re giving you that, too! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts that can help maintain or restore the natural balance of your gut microbiota. “They produce enzymes that aid in the digestion and absorption of nutrients such as vitamins and minerals,” says nutritionist Staci Gulbin. “If eaten on a regular basis, they can help support weight management through appetite control and can also help prevent gastrointestinal symptoms like antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which is a result of the disruption of gut bacteria balance."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They’re often consumed in supplement form, but getting them directly from fermented foods is an even better way to ingest a wide variety of microorganisms for a broader set of health benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-whats-the-difference-between-probiotics-and-fermented-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What's the Difference Between Probiotics and Fermented Foods? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While both probiotic-rich foods and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/pickling-vs-fermenting-8584423" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; provide similar benefits for your microbiome, they are slightly different. Probiotics are live organisms that are well-studied for their health benefits, with specific strains identified as the beneficial ones. On the other hand, fermented foods are produced through microbial growth (often involving lactic acid bacteria), but those bacteria may or may not have survived the process to make it into the food (for example, your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1554261/sourdough-boules" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sourdough bread&lt;/a&gt; does not contain live organisms). Therefore, the probiotic potential of fermented foods varies, and the types of live organisms they might contain are broader.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Many of the live, active cultures in fermented foods are not present in large enough amounts or have not been tested for specific health benefits to meet the definition of probiotics,” explains nutritionist Toby Amidor. Still, they are greatly beneficial for your digestive health and immune system, and some say even more beneficial than probiotics.

It contains live cultures of bacteria &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus thermophilus&lt;/em&gt;, which help digest lactose and promote gut health, says Amidor. "Greek yogurt is a nutrient-rich food that contributes essential nutrients such as protein, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid (B5), and riboflavin (B2). It's a great way to consume probiotics, even for those living with lactose intolerance," she adds. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kefir, yogurt’s highly drinkable and more sour cousin, is a fermented dairy drink with a more diverse array of probiotics compared to yogurt. “It’s made with two types of fermentation. The fermentation of sugar via natural milk sugar known as lactose (lactic acid fermentation), and the fermentation of yeast via kefir grains (alcoholic fermentation)," says Amidor, pointing out that this provides kefir with a variety of live and active cultures, aka the "good bacteria."

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kimchi, a Korean fermented dish most often made with cabbage, is packed with probiotic lactic acid bacteria such as &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Leuconostoc&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Weissella&lt;/em&gt;, which play a crucial role in supporting gut health. Scientific studies link kimchi’s probiotics to anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-boosting effects, contributing to weight management, digestion, and overall wellness when included regularly in the diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another traditional pickled cabbage dish, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1154538/quick-sauerkraut" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt; hails from Eastern Europe. Just like kimchi, sauerkraut is packed with lactic acid bacteria and fiber, notes nutritionist Lauren Manaker. While these fermented vegetables don’t always contain the clinically defined probiotics, Gulbin points to studies showing that kimchi and sauerkraut have "anti-inflammatory properties that can improve markers of metabolic and heart health," making them greatly beneficial.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both miso and tempeh are fermented soybean products that have been consumed in Asia for hundreds of years and have amazing probiotic benefits thanks to the live cultures introduced into these foods by the fermentation process. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/what-is-miso-8769132" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Miso&lt;/a&gt; is a seasoning paste that is most often used to create flavorful soups and broths, while tempeh comes in a firm patty-like form and can serve as a great high-protein meat substitute. If using miso for its probiotic benefits, be sure to look for the unpasteurized version.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This fizzy, fermented tea contains live bacteria and yeast strains that may contribute to gut health. Scientific studies have shown potential probiotic benefits, particularly in terms of modestly altering gut microbiota composition and improving some digestive symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Note that the probiotic counts vary widely in kombucha products.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If a cheese has been aged but not heated afterward, there’s a good chance it contains live microorganisms. According to &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-cheese-a-healthy-source-of-probiotics?" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt;, the cheeses that fit this description include Swiss, provolone, Gouda, cheddar, Edam, Gruyère, and, more surprisingly, cottage cheese.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-are-probiotic-supplements-just-as-good"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Are Probiotic Supplements Just As Good? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not really! Our experts recommend favoring probiotics through food over supplements because probiotic-rich foods come with additional nutrients like calcium, potassium, and fiber, which altogether support health. “Although some probiotic supplements can provide prebiotics to nourish probiotic microorganisms, if at all possible, try to consume probiotics through fermented foods," says Gulbin. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some studies suggest that probiotics consumed within fermented foods may have different, more potent effects compared to supplements, possibly influencing immune function differently, notes Amidor.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is no standardized "dose" for probiotics in foods, but Manaker advises aiming for at least one serving of probiotic-rich foods daily, such as a cup of yogurt or a small portion of kimchi.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Consistency is key for maintaining gut health.” For dairy products, consuming about three servings per day is generally recommended, says Amidor, with Greek yogurt and kefir excellent options to enjoy regularly.&lt;br&gt;

It’s a type of cancer that develops in the tissues of the colon or rectum. It starts in the large intestine (colon) and often develops from small, noncancerous clumps of cells called polyps. It's one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Thanks to obesity and alcohol consumption, bowel cancer has become the primary cause of the rising death toll among young adults. It is getting increasingly common, especially among younger adults. In recent years, doctors have witnessed a disturbing trend linked with colon cancer, which traditionally is viewed as a disease of older adults, but is increasingly striking people under 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, new research offers a hopeful twist toward the prevention of this type of cancer: adding just 40 to 60 grams daily of cruciferous vegetables can reduce colon cancer risk by 20-26%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Five Effective Ways to Detoxify Your Gut Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large review &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-025-04163-9" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;published in BMC Gastroenterology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; analyzed nearly 640,000 individuals and highlights how a simple dietary habit (think of including a few vegetables in your regular diet) could deliver big preventive benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers reviewed 17 large studies, involving over 639,500 people, among whom 97,595 had colorectal cancer. The results? People consuming the highest amounts of cruciferous vegetables (think broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, and Brussels sprouts) had a 20-26% lower risk of colorectal cancer compared to those eating the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that consuming around 40-60 grams daily was associated with a 20% lower risk of colon cancer. However, benefits plateaued beyond 60 grams; so more isn't necessarily better. These vegetables are rich in phytochemicals such as flavonoids, fiber, vitamin C, carotenoids, and glucosinolates, which break down into protective agents like sulforaphane when crushed or chewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why (and how) these vegetables work against colon cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruciferous vegetables are nutritional powerhouses packed with fiber, vitamin C, carotenoids, and flavonoids. But their true anti-cancer star is sulforaphane, a compound produced when these veggies are chopped or chewed. Sulforaphane and related compounds called glucosinolates kickstart the body’s detox systems, reduce inflammation, and repair cellular damage – key elements in cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the broader picture, other research supports different parts of the plant-based diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant-based dietary patterns overall showed a 46% reduced risk of colon cancer and 73% lower risk of rectal cancer in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jhpn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41043-024-00605-4" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as per the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aicr.org/resources/blog/ask-the-dietitian-get-your-facts-right-on-fiber-and-whole-grains/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Institute for Cancer Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, whole grains may lower colorectal cancer risk by around 17%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to add broccoli to your daily diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli, amongst all cruciferous vegetables, is a nutritional powerhouse, offering a wide range of health benefits due to its rich content of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. Apart from potentially helping with cancer prevention, broccoli may help with heart health and digestive health, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some simple ideas on how to incorporate cruciferous vegetables into your regular diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Aim for 40-60g daily:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roughly half a cup of chopped broccoli or its equivalent of cruciferous veggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cook smartly:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Light steaming preserves key compounds like sulforaphane while enhancing absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Add color and variety:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rotate among broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and kale for broader benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Pair with a balanced diet:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Focus on whole grains, pulses, and fruits while reducing red and processed meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Stay consistent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These are preventive strategies best practiced daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you’re looking to add some goodness to all your meals, then you can consider stirring steamed broccoli into omelets or scrambled eggs for breakfast, or tossing chopped cabbage or kale into salads or wraps for lunch. For dinner, think of adding cauliflower florets to stir-fries or pasta dishes. In fact, you can also build a healthy snacking habit by munching on roasted Brussels sprouts or kale chips. Aiming for half a cup daily means just one thoughtful inclusion per meal. That small shift can be a big deal for your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, no food is a magic cure, but adding more cruciferous vegetables to your plate, especially in the range of 40-60 grams daily, can significantly reduce your colorectal cancer risk by around 20%. Combined with other healthy habits, such as screening, exercise, and a rich variety of plant-based foods, you’re setting yourself up for stronger, more vital living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember: Every chopped floret counts.

But a new first-of-its kind study found getting a variety of flavonoids from different foods is better than just consuming large amounts from one source - and could reduce your risk of death by 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study tracked the volume and variety of flavonoids consumed by 124,805 participants between the ages of 40 and 70, accounting for sociodemographics, lifestyle, diet and medical risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Benjamin Parmenter, research fellow at Edith Cowan University in Australia, said: ‘Different flavonoids work in different ways, some improve blood pressure, others help with cholesterol levels and decrease inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This study is significant as the results indicate that consuming a higher quantity and wider diversity [of flavonoids] has the potential to lead to a greater reduction in ill health than just a single source.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dark chocolate and red wine are flavonoid-rich foods that can be incorporated into a healthy diet (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dark chocolate and red wine are just two examples of high-flavonoid foods that can be part of a healthy diet and should be consumed along with other flavonoid-rich foods and beverages, such as tea, apples, berries, oranges and grapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with chronic inflammatory illnesses like obesity stand to benefit the most from a varied, high-flavonoid diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When consumed through food, flavonoids have essentially no risk of negative effects. Flavonoid toxicity is only possible by taking too many high-potency supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-025-01176-1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal Nature, tracked diets using information from the UK biobank, a large, population-based cohort study that records biological data over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants filled out the Oxford WebQ 24-hour dietary questionnaire up to five times over the course of three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers then compared that data with the dates and causes of participants’ deaths and hospital admissions to determine the relationship between their diets and their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found people who consumed the widest variety of flavonoids, characterized as consuming an additional 6.7 flavonoid types per day, had a 14 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 10 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also had a 20 percent reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and an eight percent lower risk of cancer when compared to those who ate the lowest variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But quantity is still important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Red wine is a date night staple, but it's also one of the richest sources of flavonoids (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the study who consumed about 500mg of flavonoids per day had a 16 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Risk of cardiovascular disease was reduced by nine percent; type 2 diabetes reduced by 12 percent; and respiratory disease reduced by 13 percent when compared to people who ate just 230 mg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Flavonoid intake of around 500 milligrams a day was associated with a 16 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality,’ according to Dr Parmenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘That's roughly the amount of flavonoids that you would consume in two cups of tea,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 5oz glass of red wine on average contains about 130 milligrams of flavonoids. A bar of dark chocolate can contain anywhere from 200 milligrams to 1,000 milligrams depending on the size, manufacturer and cacao percentage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the sources of flavonoids participants consumed during the study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the effects of flavonoids on several health conditions and mortality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Take note, however, to not eat too much chocolate or wine due to their high calorie counts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 100g bar of 70 to 85 percent dark chocolate contains about 600 calories, and a 5oz glass of wine has around 120 calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A high-flavonoid meal plan could include a cup of tea in the morning with some fruits like apples and berries for breakfast, followed by dark chocolate for dessert at lunch and a glass of red wine with dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Aedín Cassidy, study co-author, said: ‘The results provide a clear public health message, suggesting that simple and achievable dietary swaps, such as drinking more tea and eating more berries and apples for example, can help increase the variety and intake of flavonoid-rich foods, and potentially improve health in the long-term.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Dementia is when memory, language, or thinking skills decline and interfere with daily life. Research shows that in addition to genetic and environmental factors, lifestyle choices—like exercise, keeping your mind active, and eating well—can play a role in your risk for dementia.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While no single food can protect your brain on its own, dietitians agree that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vegetable-for-longevity-11791598" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;leafy greens like spinach&lt;/a&gt; deserve a spot on your plate.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mitochondria are tiny structures in our body’s cells that produce energy.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Cells need energy to do everything—from moving and growing to sending signals in your brain.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Spinach is high in nitrates, which boost blood flow and oxygen to the brain for better mitochondrial performance,” says &lt;a href="http://www.epicbiologynutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Chrissy Barth, MS, RDN, IFNA-COT, RYT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A large population-based study found that for every 50-mg increase in dietary nitrates, the risk of developing dementia decreased by 8 percent.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronic neuroinflammation is inflammation in the brain or spinal cord and a known risk factor for an increased production of Aβ (amyloid-beta) plaques in the brain. These amyloid-beta plaques trigger further neurodegeneration—loss of brain function—as seen in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Spinach is one of the top sources of lutein, a brain-loving antioxidant that protects neurons from stress and supports memory and focus,” says &lt;a href="http://www.eatswimwin.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Katie Schimmelpfenning, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, research has found that older adults with folate deficiency had a higher risk of developing dementia.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This may be due to folate’s role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-habits-dementia-study-11695904" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lowering homocysteine levels&lt;/a&gt; and supporting DNA repair in brain cells, two key factors linked to dementia risk. Homocysteine is an amino acid and elevated levels can lead to health issues. However, researchers haven’t yet determined whether low folate levels are a direct cause of dementia or just an early warning sign.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our gut and brain are connected. Research suggests that eating a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-flavonol-rich-foods-11783068" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diet rich in phytochemicals&lt;/a&gt;, naturally occurring beneficial compounds found in plants like spinach, can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-antioxidant-rich-foods-you-should-eat-11776388" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;increase antioxidant activity&lt;/a&gt; in the gut. Antioxidants reduce inflammation by neutralizing free radicals—the “bad guys” that can lead to cell damage and disease. These protective effects then positively impact the brain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;bacteria in the gut ferment the dietary fiber found in spinach and produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, propionate, and acetate. These short-chain fatty acids further reduce inflammation and can help protect the health of your nervous system too.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While adding spinach to your diet is a powerful first step, there are many other things you can do to support a healthy brain. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay physically active&lt;/strong&gt;: Diet and exercise go hand in hand, especially when it comes to your brain health. “Exercising regularly, at least 150 minutes per week, helps improve blood flow, reduce stress, and improve cognitive function,” says &lt;a href="http://www.glp-1hub.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ana Reisdorf, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace the MIND diet&lt;/strong&gt;: “The MIND diet, which is rich in leafy greens, berries, oily fish and nuts, has shown benefit in supporting optimal brain health,” says Tung. In fact, research shows that people who closely follow this eating pattern have a 17% lower risk of developing dementia compared to those who follow it the least.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage your stress&lt;/strong&gt;: Chronic stress isn’t just exhausting—it may also double your risk of Alzheimer’s disease and significantly raise your chances of mild cognitive impairment.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Practice mindfulness, yoga, or spend time in nature to help lower cortisol levels and protect the areas of the brain that support memory,” says Barth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spinach helps improve blood flow to the brain, fights inflammation and supports the gut-brain connection. Emerging research suggests the nutrients found in spinach–especially folate, lutein, and nitrates–may help lower the risk of dementia over time. Pairing leafy greens like spinach with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938895/mediterranean-diet-meal-plan-to-help-support-brain-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean-style or MIND-style diet&lt;/a&gt;, regular movement and effective stress management is a powerful way to protect your brain and stay sharp as you age.&lt;br&gt;

Researchers have now pinpointed specific neurons in the amygdala that make pain feel unpleasant, opening the door to drugs that ease suffering without shutting down normal sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a new $12 million NIH grant, scientists are working to design small molecules that target these neurons safely. Though still in preclinical stages, this research could transform chronic pain management and reduce reliance on opioids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Pain-related neurons in the amygdala drive the emotional suffering of pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Opioid Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; New drug candidates aim to block unpleasantness while maintaining sensation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Backing:&lt;/strong&gt; A $12 million NIH grant supports the preclinical development of this approach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UNC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic pain is a struggle for so many and has staggering impact on the lives it affects. Matt Mauck, MD, PhD, an anesthesiologist, pain medicine physician, and chronic pain researcher at the UNC Hospitals Pain Management Center, sees this every day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic pain impacts quality of life, relationships, general activity, sleep and so many other essential life functions. and often is accompanied with many symptoms such as fatigue and low mood,” said Mauck. “Research is needed to develop new therapies to help these patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112396"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain surrounded by chains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/non-addictive-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Experts from the UNC School of Medicine, Stanford University, and the University of California, San Francisco, are now developing a small molecule with drug-like properties that can activate receptors in mouse models and the human amygdala. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain management providers use a combination of evidence-based treatment options that involve medications, therapy, injections, and specialized procedures to improve pain. But sometimes, these therapies are not enough to enable patients to have control over their pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opioid medications, like oxycodone and tramadol, can help in the short-term but the long-term use can be problematic and complicated by developing tolerance and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, like Gregory Scherrer, PharmD, PhD, are determined to create a new pain medication that can offer relief to those in need—without the addictive properties. Now supported by a multi-million U19 grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the research team is in the process of converting their basic science findings into clinically relevant results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fundamental problem is that pain is unpleasant,” said Scherrer, who is an associate professor in the UNC Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, the UNC Neuroscience Center, and the UNC Department of Pharmacology. “We are currently working on several drug candidates that can target specific neurons in the brain and turn off the ‘unpleasantness’ of pain, while maintaining sensation in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Purpose of Pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain serves as a warning signal to our bodies, alerting us that something is actually or potentially harming the body’s tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a painful stimulus is first sensed by neurons in nerves, that information is relayed to the spinal cord and up to the brain. From there, the pain becomes a conscious, emotional experience. It is this painful, negative signal that motivates us to avoid whatever is causing pain, whether that be by removing our hand off a hot stove or mending a bone fracture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when someone has chronic pain—or pain that lasts for six months or longer after an injury—the pain continues long after their “hand” has been off the stove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical companies have attempted to create medications to help address chronic pain, but with limited success so far and not without significant side effects. Opioid medications, along with the natural derivative opium, have been in use for thousands of years for pain relief. They work by binding to specific receptors in the brain, providing pain relief and the sensation of euphoria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where it gets tricky is that some pain management treatments like local anesthetics can prevent you from feeling any sensation at all, painful or otherwise,” said Scherrer. “On the other hand, opioids directly activate reward circuits in the brain and can lead to dependence or withdrawal symptoms once the therapy is stopped.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Way to Target Pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce suffering pain more efficiently and with reduced side effects, Scherrer has focused his research on the nervous system and how it perceives pain and pain relief. But for many years, researchers weren’t sure what specific neurons were responsible for making pain unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We thought that if we could find these cells somewhere in the brain, we might be able to treat pain in a whole new way,” said Scherrer. “By targeting these cells, chronic pain would be less unpleasant, but you could still sense that you have a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of research, Scherrer was able to pinpoint those exact brain cells. As revealed in a 2019 study in &lt;em&gt;Science, &lt;/em&gt;these cells are located in the amygdala, a peanut-sized area of the brain that regulates emotional responses to pain and fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a miniature microscope situated on the head of a mouse model, researchers tracked what nerves would “light up” in response to pain. Out of 17,000 neurons in the amygdala, one specific set of cells were constantly activated during pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his ground-breaking study in 2019, Scherrer needed to know what receptors within these cells could serve as docking stations for a drug-like molecule. With funding from the National Institutes of Health’s HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) Initiative, he isolated these neurons and used a technique known as RNA sequencing to identify these docking sites, and small molecules for these receptors, termed ligands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Now, The Preclinical Development Stage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Scherrer’s research received a $12 million U19 grant from the NIH to further his research. A U19 grant from the NIH is a prestigious, multi-year cooperative award that supports complex, research collaborations addressing high-priority scientific or public health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts from the UNC School of Medicine, Stanford University, and the University of California, San Francisco, are now developing a small molecule with drug-like properties that can activate receptors in mouse models and the human amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Aubé, PhD, a medicinal chemist at the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, and Bryan Roth, MD, PhD, an expert on therapeutic drug discovery at the UNC School of Medicine, will be working alongside Scherrer to elevate their research efforts. Although far from clinical trials, the team is closer than ever to creating a new pain drug,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal over the next five years or more is to develop a pain drug candidate and then to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA to begin clinical trials,” said Scherrer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pain and neuropharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8b3bdb6bcb9b4b4f6bcb9b6b1bdb4ab98adb6bbb0bdb9b4acb0f6adb6bbf6bdbcad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kendall Daniels Rovinsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unchealth.unc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UNC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kendall Daniels Rovinsky – UNC&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:27:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE1nQWVqX3l1MDBtUldpUjFTVHczWjJuaWMzakhDQjMzQmhjXzVjVmlsQUpTT3NzMjBBaXYzb2I3dHczUThabFJUMjY4Zmw0TkZ0SGhxbm5iOEZIM1djWDJiSmUtY2tibExWM0ZzdkM5QnZMSG1aRkZRRnB0bTU</guid></item><item><title>枫糖浆与蜂蜜：哪种甜味剂更适合糖尿病管理-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural sweeteners like maple syrup and honey are popular alternatives to refined sugar, offering trace nutrients and antioxidants that white sugar lacks. Sourced from plants and bees, respectively, both are considered more natural and less processed. However, for people with diabetes, it's important to understand their impact on blood sugar. While both have a moderate glycemic index, maple syrup has a slightly lower GI than honey, making it a gentler option. Choosing the right sweetener can help support better glucose control and reduce the risk of complications, but moderation remains key for maintaining overall health and managing diabetes effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The role of maple syrup and honey in managing blood sugar levels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1756464614003077" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, replacing a small portion of daily added sugar with pure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt; maple syrup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; can lead to several health benefits. These include improved glucose tolerance, modest reductions in abdominal fat and systolic blood pressure, and positive changes in gut microbiota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817209/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; highlights the potential benefits of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;honey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; for people with diabetes. Honey may help lower blood sugar levels and reduce oxidative stress, due to its natural antioxidants and nutrient content. When used in moderation, honey can provide added health benefits that support overall well-being in diabetic individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is Glycemic Index and why does it matter for diabetes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glycemic index (GI) is a ranking of carbohydrates in foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods with a high GI cause a rapid spike in blood sugar, which can be problematic for diabetics. Low to moderate GI foods provide a slower, steadier release of glucose, making blood sugar easier to control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honey typically has a GI ranging from 58 to 60, while maple syrup has a slightly lower GI, around 54. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although both maple syrup and honey have a moderate glycemic index compared to refined sugar, maple syrup’s slightly lower GI and metabolic benefits make it a gentler option for blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detailed nutritional breakdown of maple syrup and honey syrup&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. Calories and carbohydrates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both honey and maple syrup contain significant carbohydrates, primarily in the form of sugars, which contribute to their calorie content. A tablespoon of honey has about 64 calories and 17 grams of carbohydrates, while the same amount of maple syrup has about 52 calories and 13 grams of carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though maple syrup is lower in both calories and carbs, the difference is small but can add up over time, especially if you use sweeteners regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Vitamins and minerals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honey contains trace amounts of vitamins like vitamin C, B6, and folate, which support immune and metabolic health. Maple syrup is notably rich in minerals, including manganese, zinc, calcium, and potassium. Manganese, in particular, plays a role in blood sugar regulation and antioxidant function, which might benefit those with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Antioxidants and phytochemicals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sweeteners have antioxidant properties. Honey contains flavonoids and phenolic acids, which can help reduce oxidative stress. Maple syrup contains polyphenols with anti-inflammatory effects that may protect against chronic diseases, including diabetes-related complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Health implications for diabetes management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes must monitor their carbohydrate intake carefully, as carbohydrates directly influence blood glucose levels. Despite being natural, honey and maple syrup are still sugars and will raise blood sugar. Therefore, portion control is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;5. Blood sugar impact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maple syrup’s lower glycemic index means it raises blood sugar levels more slowly, potentially making it a better choice for those managing diabetes. However, the difference is slight, and individual responses can vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;6. Weight management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calories also play a role in diabetes management, especially for those who need to control body weight. Maple syrup’s slightly lower calorie count per serving can be advantageous, particularly if consumed regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to use maple syrup and honey safely&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both maple syrup and honey should be used sparingly. Here are some practical tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Portion control: Stick to about one tablespoon per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combine with fibre: Use with fibre-rich foods like oats or nuts to slow glucose absorption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor your blood sugar: Test your blood glucose after consuming these sweeteners to see how your body reacts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose pure, natural products: Avoid syrups with added sugars or artificial ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Potential downsides and precautions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dental health: Both sweeteners are acidic and sticky, which can contribute to tooth enamel erosion and cavities if proper dental hygiene is neglected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allergic reactions: Although rare, some individuals may be allergic to components in honey or maple syrup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Botulism risk in infants: Honey should never be given to children under one year due to the risk of infant botulism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medication interactions: While rare, certain compounds in these sweeteners might interact with medications; consult your doctor if unsure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which should you choose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing between honey and maple syrup depends on your health priorities, taste preferences, and how your body responds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maple syrup may be a better option for those focusing on blood sugar control due to its lower glycemic index and higher mineral content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Honey offers more vitamins and unique antioxidants, along with a sweeter taste that some may prefer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, moderation and monitoring are essential. Consult with your healthcare provider or dietitian to personalise your sweetener choice in the context of your diabetes management plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q1: Can I use honey or maple syrup daily if I have diabetes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate consumption is generally safe, but always monitor your blood sugar and consult your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q2: Are natural sweeteners healthier than refined sugar?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They do offer added nutrients and antioxidants, but still affect blood sugar, so they should be used sparingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="96"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q3: Does the source or quality of honey/maple syrup matter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes.

When this region was inactivated, the animals showed less interest in rewards and heightened sensitivity to threats, mimicking depression and anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also discovered a functional network connecting areas 46, 32, and 25 that helps counterbalance these effects, but only in the left hemisphere. These findings highlight how brain circuits underpin motivation and emotion, with implications for targeted treatments using ketamine or non-invasive brain stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Inactivation of area 46 reduced reward-seeking, resembling depressive symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The same inactivation heightened responses to threat, resembling anxiety symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; The network may explain why ketamine and brain stimulation therapies alleviate mood disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New experiments by Christian Wood and colleagues suggest that the marmoset brain area 46 (A46) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is key to a functional network that regulates positive and negative emotion-related processes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings relate directly to motivation and responsiveness to threat, which play important roles in depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112387"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42.jpg.webp 1344w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1344px) 100vw, 1344px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42.jpg 1344w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/fb-br-42-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1344px) 100vw, 1344px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They further identified a functional network, linking A46 with areas 32 and 25, that works to ameliorate the effects of A46 inactivation.

Their tireless pollination supports crops, ecosystems, and economies. Habitat loss, pesticide exposure, climate extremes, and poor nutrition have threatened their survival in recent decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beekeepers worldwide have reported unsustainable losses, raising alarms about the stability of food production. To address this crisis, experts are working on solutions that go beyond traditional hive management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have now introduced a remarkable food source that can sustain honey bee &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/national-honey-bee-day-2025-why-pollinators-matter/"&gt;colonies&lt;/a&gt; indefinitely, even without natural pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research comes from Washington State University (&lt;a href="https://wsu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WSU&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://apixbiosciences.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;APIX Biosciences NV&lt;/a&gt; in Belgium. The trials showed that nutritionally stressed colonies thrived on this specially designed diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-food-for-bees-on-the-brink"&gt;Food for bees on the brink&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The innovation mirrors the artificial diets long used for livestock and pets. It provides honey bees with every essential nutrient, potentially offering a critical strategy against rising colony collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This advancement will strengthen global food security, since bees serve as vital pollinators for agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new food resembles human “power bars.” These nutrient-rich bars are placed inside hives, where young bees process and distribute them to larvae and adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This directly addresses the growing issue of poor nutrition that has long plagued honey bee survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bees-need-better-healthier-food"&gt;Bees need better, healthier food&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in land use, urban expansion, and extreme weather all negatively impact nutrition for honey bees and other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heat-and-pollution-are-changing-the-buzz-of-bees/"&gt;pollinators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-author Brandon Hopkin is a P.F. Thurber Endowed Distinguished Professor of pollinator ecology at WSU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Honey bees are generalists and do not get all their nutrition from a single source,” said Hopkin. “They need variety in their diet to survive but find it increasingly difficult to find the continuous supply of pollen they need to sustain the colony.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick Pilkington, CEO of APIX Biosciences US, emphasized the uniqueness of this breakthrough. “Until this study, honey bees were the only livestock that could not be maintained on a (human-made) feed,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials showed that colonies under nutritional stress fared much better on the new diet compared to current feeding practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-a-better-bee-diet"&gt;Building a better bee diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project took over a decade of research and global collaboration. Thierry Bogaert is the study’s lead author and chairman of APIX Biosciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The newly published work is the result of a Herculean scientific effort of three teams,” Bogaert enthused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First, the founders and scientists of APIX Biosciences who tested thousands of combinations of ingredients on honey bees over more than 10 years to create this feed,” Bogart continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Second, the WSU team, with leading honey bee and field expertise. And third, leading beekeepers in California, together with extension teams, made large-scale, science-based field testing of feeds possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major finding during the research was the discovery of isofucosterol, a nutrient found naturally in pollen. This molecule proved critical for bee &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/when-bees-arrive-late-flowers-may-vanish/#google_vignette"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-missing-piece-in-bee-diets"&gt;Missing piece in bee diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that not all sterols in pollen play the same role for bees. For decades, 24-methylenecholesterol was considered the most critical sterol, but experiments showed that colonies could survive without it, though with some decline in brood production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, removing isofucosterol had severe effects, including reduced brood growth and neuromuscular dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isofucosterol depletion caused bees to move sluggishly and exhibit impaired coordination, reducing their ability to forage and care for brood. Colonies missing this nutrient collapsed, proving it to be an essential sterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that the nutrient’s importance may stem from how it influences cell membranes and nerve functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other sterols, bees appear to conserve isofucosterol more carefully, suggesting an evolutionary mechanism to retain it for vital processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trials-show-colonies-rebound"&gt;Trials show colonies rebound&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm real-world effectiveness, the WSU team tested the diet with colonies in blueberry and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sunflower-family-tree-explains-evolution-of-flower-symmetry/"&gt;sunflower&lt;/a&gt; fields. These environments are known to have poor pollen quality and typically stress colonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that colonies receiving the complete diet maintained higher survival and growth, while those on commercial substitutes or no feed declined sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, colonies on the new diet also displayed feed efficiency similar to natural pollen. For every capped brood cell produced, the bees consumed almost the same diet mass they would have with pollen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding highlights that the artificial feed can truly substitute pollen, not just supplement it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some beekeepers don’t pollinate blueberries anymore because colonies suffer or die and the pollination fees don’t cover the losses,” Hopkins explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/disease-attacking-blueberry-plants-is-spreading-around-the-world/"&gt;Blueberry&lt;/a&gt; pollen isn’t very nutritious for honey bees, and they aren’t adapted well to pollinating that crop. But if they have this supplemental food source, beekeepers may return to pollinating those fields since they know their bees are more likely to survive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-saving-bees-securing-food"&gt;Saving bees, securing food&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual colony losses remain alarmingly high, highlighting the urgency of this breakthrough. The study demonstrated that colonies given the complete diet remained strong from spring through autumn, even during periods of transport, high-density storage, and natural pollen scarcity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These larger, healthier colonies are better prepared for overwintering, a key predictor of survival in temperate climates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are confident that the product will positively impact &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/smart-sensors-help-beekeepers-monitor-hive-health/"&gt;beekeepers&lt;/a&gt; and growers once it’s available to purchase in the U.S., targeted for mid-2026,” Pilkington said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are working with WSU and the beekeeping community across the U.S. to develop the best way to make use of this new tool in agricultural settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By addressing nutritional gaps, this innovation could reshape pollination practices, reduce losses, and strengthen the food systems that depend on honey bees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2024.3078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 11:42:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNYWZ0Q1dBdDJhVV9UZUhLZGtORFB0eFZFZ0QyVVdDc0tBWW85c0I3bkNieU5SOGFyT0lSYUFpYUI4dXNNSHpKREdYeFFhaFpRWlUwSjFUQWZ6VlluakJEcFB3dmh5SDEwUzRrRnhwM0R4SkJkSGJJZ3dHTUo1M2xmTEZNUjlWNG1WMW9UZ0NvemNMYTZtWHNFTEpiMnVRSkJma1NyblI2NFU</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现如何“真正逆转”记忆丧失并保持大脑年轻-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxNTE1lN1pyS3AyejM3a1ltQmQ2eTk4M2hIeTF0S3RsMFYxWDVmV190TkZJaHF2cURYa0c4d1pyYWItS1VwUEttYXdlUGtleVhZT0x0eWhkVm8xRG1NODRITDNZVS1DZW9WSmdKXzlFT3ZwcjFNUnEwbnVGWTNNZFU5MDg0aS1HYlhrUy02QWI2eERoNGsxajc0bk5ZT25vbXRTSDFUa1pFTkRKcFBU0gGyAUFVX3lxTE9lRmdwU0V0SE55VXFSSGRybmVLQ3VEaTNNTDZ2SUhEMHJqMmF0MkZ2THdjZUczQ21QVDVKeklndmNVbVRmeEJEbWZ4VF9kOFFJalIwVFJmRFo3NTVjc2dlVTBnY25kZTQ2VVNuWWYzeXJlbXlaVDh2LTRTS0t2MHpVOEJQdXJneGpYTTVFTi0wLWFNSjY5RUJhUnJmTklHSkp0eGI5OERybjhnX0QwbFlHQWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have reversed memory loss in aging mice by targeting a protein that builds up in brain cells, pointing toward a potential pathway to counter the cognitive declines of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new study, researchers from the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-930b86d0-7eb2-11f0-b35e-f1b04a526a83"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, San Francisco, examined a protein called ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), which was found to accumulate in the brain's memory center as mice aged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When they artificially increased the protein in young mice, the animals developed memory impairments. But when they reduced its levels in older mice, their cognitive performance was boosted to levels seen in much younger mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The protein is believed to disrupt energy production within cells, essentially starving neurons of the power needed to form and store memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;FTL1 is linked to normal, age-related memory decline, which includes common cognitive changes that affect nearly everyone as they get older, even without a disease like &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-93060890-7eb2-11f0-b35e-f1b04a526a83"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;. Focusing on this protein represents a much larger segment of the aging population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Saul Villeda, associate director of the UCSF Bakar Aging Research Institute and senior author of the paper, said: ‘It is truly a reversal of impairments. It’s much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Understanding how aging alters brain cells and molecules is crucial to explaining why some people develop neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and other &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13907587/common-injury-increase-dementia-risk-study.html"&gt;forms of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between six and 12 million Americans 65 and up have been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia. About a third of those people develop Alzheimer’s disease within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Rebecca, a 48-year-old single mom, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's after debilitating cognitive symptoms upended her life &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco discovered that a protein known as ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) builds up in the brain's memory hub of aging mice (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using specialized genetic tools and viruses, the scientists either increased or decreased the levels of the FTL1 protein - which is part of the body's system that stores iron in cells - in the mice's brains, specifically in the brain’s memory center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They put the mice through various memory and learning tests, such as mazes and recognizing new objects, to see how these changes affected their cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the tests, they examined the mouse brain tissue under microscopes, counting how many connections between brain cells were lost or regained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then measured if the brain cells were generating enough energy to function properly and used dyes to see how iron was being stored in the brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that levels of the FTL1 protein were significantly higher in the memory center of old mice compared to young mice. The higher the FTL1 levels in old mice, the worse they performed on memory tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When scientists artificially increased FTL1 in young, healthy mice, it made them forgetful. They performed just as poorly on memory tests as old mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when they reduced FTL1 levels in old, forgetful mice, their memory dramatically improved. They started performing like young mice again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Repeat experiments proved their results were not a fluke. Multiple trial rounds, using different genetic approaches to reduce FTL1, consistently produced the same outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They published their findings in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00940-z#Sec2"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An estimated 6 to 12 million Americans aged 65 and older have mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Approximately one-third of these individuals will progress to Alzheimer's dementia within a five-year period (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the findings are promising, the authors cautioned that the research was conducted only in male mice and that human applications remain in the distance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A process that successfully reverses memory decline in a mouse's brain may not work the same way, or at all, in the far more complex human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia research has traditionally centered on beta-amyloid and tau proteins, which are known to accumulate in the brain and form clumps and tangles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The harmful buildup of proteins is exacerbated as the aging brain loses its natural ability to dispose of metabolic waste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This research significantly broadens the potential pool of people who could benefit from the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amyloid and Tau research primarily aims to treat or prevent Alzheimer's disease, but not everyone who ages will get Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But for thousands of people today, the reality of cognitive decline is a present and devastating diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rebecca, a 48-year-old single mother from British Columbia, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's after months of debilitating cognitive symptoms that disrupted her daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jana Nelson was 50 when diagnosed with early-onset dementia, following severe personality changes and a sharp cognitive decline that left her unable to solve simple math problems or name colors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She experienced severe memory lapses, most notably forgetting names and mid-conversation blackouts where she would suddenly lose her train of thought entirely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The episodes progressed beyond simple forgetfulness to a profound inability to process information, such as opening her work laptop and having 'zero idea how to do my job,' even when looking at her own training notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Jana Nelson's diagnosis of early-onset dementia at age 50 was preceded by severe personality changes, going from a laid-back woman to being short-tempered with extreme, unmanageable mood swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her cognitive abilities sharply declined, manifesting as an inability to solve simple math problems like calculating change from five dollars or name different colors. She became unsteady on her feet, began to repeat herself, and struggled profoundly with problem-solving tasks and spatial reasoning, such as fitting a key into a shaped hole or drawing a clock face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;FTL1 research aims to address the mechanisms behind the general, age-related memory decline that affects nearly everyone, even younger adults who begin to experience memory lapses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Villeda said: ‘We’re seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age. It’s a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than four years ago, President Donald Trump heralded the arrival of safe and effective messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines for COVID-19. He &lt;a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-operation-warp-speed-vaccine-summit/"&gt;called them&lt;/a&gt; “a monumental national achievement” and “one of the greatest miracles in the history of modern-day medicine.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mRNA platform enabled scientists to begin work on a vaccine within days of the publication of COVID-19’s genetic sequence. Clinical trials for an mRNA vaccine began weeks later, just five days after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But earlier this month, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the cancellation of more than $500 million in HHS contracts through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) that supported mRNA vaccine development. Trump himself seemed indifferent to the attack on arguably the most widely praised legacy of his first term. “That was now a long time ago, and we’re onto other things,” Trump &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Ng6Ihm3LQY0?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=1839"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; when asked this month about Operation Warp Speed—the program that helped speed COVID vaccine development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers and former biosecurity officials argue the administration’s turn against mRNA will only leave the United States less able to respond to future disease and public health threats, even as geopolitical adversaries like China ramp up on investments in the technology.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s criticism of the COVID mRNA vaccines as having “fail[ed] to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu” is in keeping with his anti-vaccine stance and multifront &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/morning/vaccines-under-attack/"&gt;rollback&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine policy since taking over at HHS. His stated justifications for pulling back from mRNA vaccines rely on &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/13/rfk-jr-mrna-vaccine-research-science-papers-justification-misreading/"&gt;misrepresented&lt;/a&gt; studies and unsupported claims about safety and effectiveness. “The idea that mRNA vaccines ‘failed’ because they didn’t block all respiratory infections reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of immunology,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1952900074503323825"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; Jake Scott, an infectious disease researcher and professor at Stanford University School of Medicine. “No vaccine for flu, RSV, or COVID has ever done that. The goal is preventing severe disease, and mRNA vaccines delivered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s advisers at HHS have made even more outlandish and unsupported claims about mRNA vaccines. Steven Hatfill—a virologist who in May joined the HHS Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, the office responsible for preparing against pandemic and biosecurity threats—&lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v6x9spe-dr.-hatfill-studies-showed-no-net-benefit.-rather-they-showed-cellular-havo.html?e9s=src_v1_ucp_v"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month on Steve Bannon’s podcast, “There was no benefit to risk ratio for taking a messenger RNA vaccine. In fact, it was more dangerous to take a vaccine than it was to contract COVID-19 and be hospitalized with it.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have &lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that COVID vaccines prevented more than 3 million additional deaths and 18 million hospitalizations in the U.S. alone. The vaccine platform is particularly valuable for pandemic response because of the speed at which mRNA vaccines can be developed and updated to fight newly emergent viruses and strains. The “whole virus” vaccines that Kennedy says HHS will prioritize in lieu of mRNA utilize much older vaccine technology. These vaccines use inactivated or “whole killed” viruses to trigger an immune response. Cultivating these vaccines requires growing and purifying viruses in a lab, an expensive and time consuming process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But mRNA vaccines use RNA to deliver a protein from the virus—not the virus itself—that triggers an immune response. Vaccines can be formulated, as was the case with COVID, almost as soon as the genetic code of the virus is known without the need to have a live sample of the virus itself, let alone grow large quantities of it in a lab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said that canceled grants are part of a “wind-down” and “broader shift” away from investments in mRNA vaccines. Instead, HHS will prioritize “whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms.” The move followed the May &lt;a href="https://feeds.issuerdirect.com/news-release.html?newsid=5696979480296745&amp;amp;symbol=MRNA"&gt;cancellation&lt;/a&gt; of more than $700 million in HHS funding to Moderna for developing mRNA influenza vaccines, including one against bird flu that had shown promising results in an early clinical trial. The termination also ended the government’s “right to purchase pre-pandemic influenza vaccines.” The company said in &lt;a href="http://v/"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; it will “explore alternatives for late-stage development and manufacturing” for the bird flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, companies will likely shrink or end their work on the BARDA-funded projects. “The 22 terminated projects worth $500 million represent the expensive late-stage development that BARDA uniquely funds—Phase 3 trials, manufacturing scale-up, and strategic stockpiling that private companies can’t afford,” &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/13/rfk-jr-mrna-vaccine-research-science-papers-justification-misreading/#:~:text=The%2022%20terminated%20projects%20worth%20%24500%20million%20represent%20the%20expensive%20late%2Dstage%20development%20that%20BARDA%20uniquely%20funds%20%E2%80%94%20Phase%203%20trials%2C%20manufacturing%20scale%2Dup%2C%20and%20strategic%20stockpiling%20that%20private%20companies%20can%E2%80%99t%20afford."&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; Scott, the Stanford infectious disease researcher.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the longer term, biotech investments in mRNA vaccines could fall off, and some investors are already &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/14/mrna-vaccine-funding-cuts-leave-biotech-investors-wary/#:~:text=Life%20science%20venture,RiverVest%20Venture%20Partners."&gt;considering&lt;/a&gt; pulling back from mRNA vaccines. For the development and innovations that continue, researchers predict the work will find a home in other countries looking to capitalize on the vacuum left by the Trump administration. “The research is going to continue, but it’s going to continue in Europe and Asia and China,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/mrna-vaccines-backlash-covid.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20research%20is,driving%20that%20away.%E2%80%9D"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Drew Weissman, the University of Pennsylvania researcher whose work on mRNA enabled COVID vaccine development and earned him a &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/weissman/facts/"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that reason, scientists and health officials who served in the first Trump administration have decried Kennedy’s decision, saying HHS is surrendering a crucial biosecurity tool. “Ending BARDA’s investment in mRNA technology creates a national security vulnerability,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/chrismeekins/status/1952896777398456728"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Chris Meekins, the deputy assistant secretary in the HHS pandemic and biosecurity preparedness office during Trump’s first term. “These tools serve as a deterrent to prevent other nations from using certain biological agents.” Jerome Adams, the surgeon general during Trump’s first term, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trumps-ex-surgeon-general-says-people-are-going-to-die-after-rfk-jr-cuts-mrna-vaccine-funding/"&gt;issued a more dire warning&lt;/a&gt;: “People are going to die because we are cutting short funding for this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling behind on mRNA technology would be like losing an arms race, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/opinion/mrna-vaccines.html"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to Rick Bright, who served as BARDA director during the first Trump administration. He called mRNA technology the “equivalent of a missile defense system for biology … Adversaries who invest in this technology will be able to respond faster to outbreaks, protecting their populations sooner than we can. Right now, the United States has a decisive advantage in mRNA science, manufacturing capacity and regulatory expertise. But in an era where biological threats can be engineered, losing this competitive edge would leave the United States vulnerable and dependent on others for lifesaving tools.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID pandemic provided something of a case study in the costs of lacking the most promising biotechnology. Jeff Coller, the director of the Johns Hopkins University RNA Innovation Center whose graduate student helped design the Moderna COVID vaccine,  explained to &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch &lt;/em&gt;that China relied on “whole virus” or attenuated virus for its COVID vaccines during the pandemic. “It didn’t work nearly as effectively as the mRNA vaccines,” he said of China’s response. When a pandemic viruses mutates, mRNA vaccines can also be quickly updated. “If you have an emergent pandemic, an emergency situation, where you desperately need to get this vaccine out to the population, or people are going to lose their lives, mRNA, no question, is the way to go,” Coller added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;China seems to have taken this to heart. Outside of the U.S., the country currently hosts &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2025/08/20/rfk-jrs-attack-on-mrna-technology-endangers-the-world#:~:text=chart%3A%20the%20economist,any%20other%20country."&gt;the most clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA vaccine candidates. “China is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-begins-work-china-mrna-manufacturing-site-2023-11-28/"&gt;doubling down&lt;/a&gt; on this, and soon will be the global leader in mRNA based medicines and therapeutics,” Coller said, warning that in future pandemics the U.S. could be forced to acquire vaccines from China. Sen. Bill Cassidy, the GOP senator whose vote advanced Kennedy’s nomination for HHS secretary, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1953239825353425174"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; canceling the mRNA contracts “conceded to China an important technology needed to combat cancer and infectious disease.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coller is also a founder of the Alliance for mRNA Medicines, an advocacy group consisting of biotech and pharmaceutical companies and leading mRNA research centers. He said the group’s members have begun to contemplate moving their work elsewhere in light of the administration’s turn against mRNA. “It was really a shot across the bow, a warning that the United States is really not a friendly nation for this technology,” Coller said. “Many of the membership that are involved in the mRNA business recognize that and say, ‘Look, we’re going to have to develop our technologies in other countries, move our brick and mortar somewhere else’ because while the United States is retreating from the technology, most other countries are not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;

Then after a full menstrual cycle they took a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During both phases they had a special type of brain scan—a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alongside this they self-reported their mood with the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP)—a clinical tool used for assessing menstrual mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood samples showed that hormone levels were suppressed during the oral contraceptive phase, confirming they were working. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The recent study found taking oral contraceptives may lower your brain function's individuality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the researchers analysed the brain scans, they looked at 'functional connectivity'—the way different parts of the brain communicate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using a new technique known as functional connectome fingerprinting, they were able to see whether each woman's brain activity was distinctive enough to pick her out from the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results showed that while on the pill, participants' brain activity became noticeably more alike, dulling the unique signatures that normally set individuals apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although each brain pattern remained identifiable, the interactions between regions lost some of their distinctiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The effect was strongest in networks linked to executive control (which helps us plan and achieve goals), somatomotor processing (which governs voluntary movements), salience detection (the ability to pick out important details in a scene), and the 'default mode' network—active when the brain is at rest and not focused on a task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In short, the researchers say the pill's impact was not confined to one area but appeared to have a broad dampening effect across the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The women also reported more negative mood symptoms while on the contraceptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These feelings were tied to 13 specific connections between brain regions, including the frontal pole, superior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus — all key hubs in emotional processing and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Last year, presenter Davina McCall fronted a Channel 4 documentary, Pill Revolution, highlighting her concerns about the side-effects of the contraceptive pill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

In practice this means sugars are broken down more slowly so food stays in the gut longer and post-meal blood glucose rises less sharply.

					&lt;p&gt;Muscle loss after 45 is a real health issue that can affect mobility, strength, and independence as you age. Known as sarcopenia, the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/how-can-strength-training-build-healthier-bodies-we-age#:~:text=of%20optimal%20health.-,What%20is%20sarcopenia?,the%20odds%20of%20developing%20sarcopenia." target="_blank"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; says this age-related muscle decline begins as early as your 30s and accelerates with each decade. And according to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3276215/" target="_blank"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, you could lose 3 to 8 percent of your muscle mass every decade after the age of 30 without regular resistance training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less muscle mass can impact your &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572145/" target="_blank"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6370503/" target="_blank"&gt;balance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6571089/" target="_blank"&gt;joint health&lt;/a&gt;, and can make everyday tasks like climbing stairs, carrying groceries, or getting up from a chair significantly more challenging. It also &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/48/1/16/5126243" target="_blank"&gt;increases your risk of falls and fractures&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to a cascade of other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that muscle loss isn’t inevitable. Regular resistance and functional training (e.g., using your bodyweight, resistance bands, or light weights) can slow down, or in some cases reverse, the natural decline in muscle mass. A 2023 review in the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10579494/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;BMJ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that consistent resistance training can boost muscle size, strength, and function in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with all the conflicting information online, knowing which exercises are best for reversing muscle loss can be tricky. That’s why we spoke with Chris Mohr, PhD, RD, fitness and nutrition advisor at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://barbend.com/experts/chris-mohr-phd-rd/" target="_blank"&gt;BarBend&lt;/a&gt;, who reveals his top five daily exercises for improving strength, balance, and daily function after 45.

&lt;p&gt;Step-ups strengthen the major muscles of your lower body while simultaneously improving single-leg stability, which is essential for fall prevention as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Step-ups mimic real-life movement like climbing stairs,” Mohr says. “They work your glutes, quads, and hamstrings while improving balance. Use a sturdy step, press through your heel to rise up, then lower slowly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand facing a sturdy step, bench, or low platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step up with your right foot, pressing firmly through the heel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring your left foot up to meet your right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step down with your right foot, then your left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternate the lead leg each set to keep the work even.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Reps:&lt;/b&gt; 3 sets of 10 reps per leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Start with a low step height for safety, and position it near a wall or railing for balance support if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This throwback to high school gym class has stood the test of time for good reason. Wall sits target your quads, glutes, and hamstrings to help make activities like walking, standing, and stair climbing easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohr explains, “Wall sits build lower body endurance and strength without needing equipment. Slide down a wall until your knees are at 90 degrees and hold. Start with 30 seconds, build up to a minute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with your back against a wall, feet hip-width apart and about two feet from the wall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slide down until your knees are bent at roughly 90 degrees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your back flat against the wall and your core engaged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold for the prescribed time without letting your knees cave inward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Time:&lt;/b&gt; Start with 30 seconds, work up to one minute. Do 3 rounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; If a full 90-degree bend feels uncomfortable, adjust to a higher position while still feeling your muscles engage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This push-up variation is a joint-friendly move for building upper body strength without going all the way to the floor. They’re a total upper body muscle mass booster, targeting your chest, triceps, shoulders, and core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pushups against a bench or counter take pressure off your wrists and shoulders while still targeting your chest, arms, and core,” Mohr says. “Keep your body straight, lower with control, and press back up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand facing a sturdy bench, countertop, or table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hands on the surface, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step your feet back until your body forms a straight line from head to heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows and lower your chest toward the surface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your palms to return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Reps:&lt;/b&gt; 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; The lower the surface, the more challenging the move. Start higher and gradually work your way down to increase difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chair-assisted lunges can help increase lower body strength, hip flexibility, and balance. “Hold onto the back of a chair for balance,” Mohr instructs. “Step one leg back and lower into a lunge, then return to standing. This is great for strengthening your legs and hips and helps improve mobility.”&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, holding the back of a sturdy chair for support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step your right foot back and lower your body into a lunge, bending both knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your front knee over your ankle and your torso upright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push through your front heel to return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat all reps on one leg before switching sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Reps:&lt;/b&gt; 3 sets of 10 reps per leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Start with a shallow lunge and increase depth over time as strength and mobility improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rows are a killer exercise for strengthening your upper back, biceps, and forearms. They can also improve posture, which is essential for lifting, carrying, and keeping the shoulders in a healthy position as you age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohr says, “Use a resistance band anchored securely to a door. Pull the handles toward your ribcage, squeeze your shoulder blades, then release slowly. This strengthens your back and arms, which are often neglected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchor a resistance band securely to a door or stable object at chest height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the handles or ends of the band with palms facing each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step back to create tension in the band.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull the handles toward your ribcage, squeezing your shoulder blades together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Reps:&lt;/b&gt; 3 sets of 12 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Keep your core engaged throughout the movement to avoid leaning backward.&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The increase makes sense for this time of year, as people spend more time indoors in air-conditioned spaces or settle back into their fall routines, experts said. Residents are returning from vacation, and students are returning to school, said Andrew Lover, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It doesn’t look particularly worrisome. It’s kind of expected,” Lover said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Over the last few years, the uptick has peaked in late August and lasted until Labor Day, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So far, Massachusetts has not been impacted as heavily as other states, including Texas, Nevada, and Utah, which have reached “very high” levels of waste water, according to CDC data from &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Aug. 3 to Aug. 9&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Infectious disease experts are keeping a close eye on the now dominant variant, XFG or &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/coronavirus/2025/08/14/what-to-know-summer-colds-covid-19-variant-stratus/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.boston.com/news/coronavirus/2025/08/14/what-to-know-summer-colds-covid-19-variant-stratus/"&gt;“Stratus”&lt;/a&gt;, which was first identified in Southeast Asia in January.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;According to CDC data, the XFG variant accounts for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-variants.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;65 percent&lt;/a&gt; of virus samples in waste water as of Aug. 9. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It’s hard to tell the extent to which Stratus is affecting Massachusetts, because&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;sequencing — the process that determines the genetic makeup of a virus — has “dropped off” in a lot of places, Lover said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Stratus causes similar symptoms to other COVID-19 variants, including fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, and loss of taste or smell. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The updated COVID vaccines that the Food and Drug Administration approved earlier this year should offer “some pretty decent protection” against Stratus, Lover said. The World Health Organization said “currently approved COVID-19 vaccines are expected to remain effective” against this variant, according to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;a June report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Unlike previous years, however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee has yet to issue recommendations for who should receive booster shots this fall. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“One worry, right now, is that vaccine uptake may be suboptimal relative to prior years,” Lover said. “We’ll have to see what comes out in the next few weeks.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is considering limiting the &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/covid-19-vaccine-label-change-alpha" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/covid-19-vaccine-label-change-alpha"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; to adults over the age of 65 and people who are at high risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As long as the FDA approves the drug, clinicians can still prescribe it to people outside those limitations, said Daniel Kuritzkes, the chief of the division of Infectious Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If the vaccine is approved, any physician can prescribe it to a patient who they think might benefit from the vaccine,” Kuritzkes said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the FDA is also weighing whether to &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/12/lifestyle/covid-young-children-pfizer/?utm_campaign=Globe_Facebook&amp;amp;s_campaign=bostonglobe%3Asocialflow%3Afacebook&amp;amp;p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;revoke&lt;/a&gt; authorization for Pfizer’s COVID vaccine for children under the age of 5. If the FDA does that, physicians would have “no discretion” to provide the vaccine for people who fall outside those restrictions, because authorizations are more restrictive than approvals, according to Kuritzkes. Pfizer is the only COVID vaccine available to that age group, so if authorization is revoked, kids younger than 5 will not have an officially approved option. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;On Tuesday, the &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/?srsltid=AfmBOooFUq8jhyxgjSSTTLwiOwyexEbizmubb-iVcIfOJxKprUEH38s2" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, diverging from the federal government, strongly recommended COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years. The group also advised that older children should have access to the vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Despite the uncertainty this fall, Dr. Sabrina Assoumou, an infectious disease specialist at Boston Medical Center, encouraged patients to stay up-to-date with their vaccinations. “Vaccines protect against severe disease, hospitalization, and death,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Another way to lower the risk of infection is to move gatherings outside, if the option is available, because ventilation can decrease the risk of transmission, she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;If you are at risk for severe disease and develop COVID, contact your health professional, she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If you have symptoms, get tested — so we can break that chain of transmission,” Assoumou said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Assoumou encouraged patients to listen to local and state public health agencies, as well as professional medical societies, like the Infectious Diseases Society of America, of which she is a member.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The society is working with the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt; to create guidance on COVID-19 immunization, and on Tuesday the group released &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/vaccine-integrity-project-presents-reassuring-data-vaccines-upcoming-respiratory-virus" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/vaccine-integrity-project-presents-reassuring-data-vaccines-upcoming-respiratory-virus"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; detailing key findings on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But ultimately, doctors like Assoumou are waiting to see what the federal government will do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“At this point, it’s most helpful to wait to see what happens, so that we can make recommendations  [to the] public,” Assoumou said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We all are committed to evidence-based recommendations,”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Robbie Goldstein, Massachusetts’ public health commissioner and a participant in the meetings, told the Globe Thursday. “It is not a question about, ‘Are we breaking from the federal government?’ It is, ‘How do we continue to do this thing that we’ve always done?’ which is to use science and evidence to drive our recommendations.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Goldstein emphasized the meetings were not specifically held to plot a separate path from federal authorities. The goal, he said, was to consider the future and structure of public health services. But the conversations were in part a response to the Trump administration’s public health policies, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The states have not made any vaccination&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;policy changes based on the discussions so far, nor have they decided on a coordinated plan. But, the meeting itself marks a step toward independence from federal health agencies that a few years ago would have seemed unthinkable. Simply gathering each state’s public health leadership in one place is unusual. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Leaders of the public health departments of every New England state except New Hampshire, as well as New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, attended the meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday, Rhode Island’s Department of Health confirmed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson for the New Hampshire’s Department of Health and Human Resources said the state coordinates with national, regional, and local public health agencies in other ways. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The federal Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Massachusetts is a national leader in the growing effort to maintain public health standards during the Trump administration, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota vaccine expert working to compensate for Trump administration policies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“They’re doing things right now that no other state is doing,” Osterholm said. “Their leadership is important not just for the Northeast but for the whole country.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Goldstein &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/22/metro/trump-cuts-cdc-public-health-massachusetts/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/22/metro/trump-cuts-cdc-public-health-massachusetts/"&gt;has noted&lt;/a&gt; Massachusetts policymakers anticipated the possibility of a second Trump term and began preparing for federal funding cuts to public health programs well before the presidential election. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For decades, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been a reliable, nonpartisan coordinator of health information and guidance for the nation. States generally abide by the agency’s recommendations on who should receive which vaccinations. This year, though, delays in important vaccine recommendations and some decisions that seem guided more by ideology than science have rattled health and medical experts’ faith in the agency’s&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;ability under Kennedy to provide credible guidance. Kennedy ousted this summer a t&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/09/business/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-fires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/09/business/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-fires/"&gt;rusted CDC advisory panel&lt;/a&gt; that helped shape the agency’s vaccine recommendations, replacing members with less experienced personnel, including some who openly share his skepticism toward vaccines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“When we have such dramatic changes at the CDC,” Goldstein said, “it’s important for us to really double down on our commitment to science and evidence based recommendations.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;States could shape their vaccination recommendations with guidance from professional medical societies instead of the CDC, Goldstein has said. A coordinated message from Northeast states would help push insurers to cover recommended vaccines, he said, and lessen confusion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The other states participating in the Providence meetings were more circumspect about the event. A spokesperson from the Rhode Island health department said the meeting was simply an opportunity to discuss coordination and information sharing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Yet states are beginning to take steps toward more independence. While&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the Supreme Court ruled more than &lt;a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/197/11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/197/11/"&gt;a century ago&lt;/a&gt; that states can establish their own vaccination policies, many states have the CDC’s guidelines baked into law. That must change if states want to rely on recommendations from medical societies instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Governor Maura Healey introduced language in two supplemental budget bills this summer to give the state’s health commissioner more authority to set vaccine requirements &lt;a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/H4429" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/H4429"&gt;for schools&lt;/a&gt; and ensure a state fund can continue to cover the cost of &lt;a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/H4251.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/H4251.pdf"&gt;children’s vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And, Rhode Island this year &lt;a href="https://webserver.rilegislature.gov/BillText/BillText25/HouseText25/H5427A.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://webserver.rilegislature.gov/BillText/BillText25/HouseText25/H5427A.pdf"&gt;passed a law&lt;/a&gt; that grants pharmacists permission to administer COVID vaccines to children without federal approvals. Pennsylvania legislators expect to &lt;a href="https://www.pahouse.com/InTheNews/NewsRelease/?id=139220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.pahouse.com/InTheNews/NewsRelease/?id=139220"&gt;introduce a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would protect private insurance coverage for vaccines recommended by professional medical societies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;One of that bill’s sponsors, state Representative Arvind Venkat, a Pittsburgh Democrat, emphasized such legislation isn’t a vaccine mandate, but protects access to preventative measures grounded in science. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Nationally, the process of building a system for sharing scientific information about vaccinations independent from federal authorities is already underway. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As state public health leaders met in Providence Tuesday, the Vaccine Integrity Project, led by Osterholm, held a hour and a half virtual session to share information about the safety and efficacy of various flu, COVID, and RSV vaccines, mirroring the traditional function of the CDC advisory panel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Also on Tuesday, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued recommendations for COVID &lt;a href="https://watermark02.silverchair.com/peds_2025073924.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAzwwggM4BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggMpMIIDJQIBADCCAx4GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMrl99JII0UXg272B3AgEQgIIC771FZU5DiurEdzyFjjqZUyDLnDEq5i4a-8pMZGQCXtkZZZKAVL-OQSSlpu_AIov8PAvUD_vpNxgnu4p2IpNda-mOFvPH3DOmos8dul9xJsSAWNwjASSMqC9OsaOZjXhAAn3SS6uhjKSVLw5darXPe-tuJGI61pzTyxFskamtykOdnbmUlKuuCAL1X0HBx2U03ucTzP0-0LPFN2uy7KYOEMhFMh5Lv_XTOAVEpnv2X-d_mz3t8eDYxzIjLSJUsbpA8YDEV2BemsUogfW2Of2Qgt2ll2MjjLwVWR89ZyLSyrsuU9jMtFhKl7p3XLeUflI2Lze7AX7yLOhToHYYQBqbuB6L0G1llan9ttS1-SKTZ1oiH_TjFZdSWIJoJAJlyVXNgTeYHRnOaeCz__z1MuOwECsu1QM7IH5MhHwKUVWQHsXZekWSUPgfoYS-FIcauqbVrTxR4jMwQdUZ03-PXGzzQwWFZXgdeoA6Ajl_A5IkOCf-YOuBKo87tevIAfxKJkVl5BVojJJo-NO8fTaDjmBE5UY8oxfqJORIMFr7fW4K1H5qfDPRgKok4jG6getJ7N3LkZV6981973xiwYAy6s7RdhZcMQ9Nb1o873dK9oXTg1HvHmHet2D--DcPOhk94WaD2zyKlNOJeZ5f31aw00vZ5RLUyhHgcB_uj-4GTvhTVZTHw45OqWXxy4_UBPr49vB0xpLkW6AJgI1VvxjYFU2O62syGg0uOlRJO3JcSF-ZO_3VsyaL-pc8GMRhlN_pM3dtMpa5zTFDAbaPKoB7FuScR_dQbaPEtR3w48UlFYwHp6ccfp5cvRT8mjYh7LIHdHdaoDU1p6Gx9i_nJM2z0AdN_3haZaH9nAM2Jd3WU1JtzMQ5OplvimgptRHpGxiza-ubhxDpEkefhwQUKXdXGEFih9xDPbw-DiSWsADdq_alhyBNj8y33EGaXUCTyHDJvMdKFus3CP8qnxtyHzlZfB_YNurQ_jTtZmQVs1N9uqVpBYc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://watermark02.silverchair.com/peds_2025073924.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAzwwggM4BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggMpMIIDJQIBADCCAx4GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMrl99JII0UXg272B3AgEQgIIC771FZU5DiurEdzyFjjqZUyDLnDEq5i4a-8pMZGQCXtkZZZKAVL-OQSSlpu_AIov8PAvUD_vpNxgnu4p2IpNda-mOFvPH3DOmos8dul9xJsSAWNwjASSMqC9OsaOZjXhAAn3SS6uhjKSVLw5darXPe-tuJGI61pzTyxFskamtykOdnbmUlKuuCAL1X0HBx2U03ucTzP0-0LPFN2uy7KYOEMhFMh5Lv_XTOAVEpnv2X-d_mz3t8eDYxzIjLSJUsbpA8YDEV2BemsUogfW2Of2Qgt2ll2MjjLwVWR89ZyLSyrsuU9jMtFhKl7p3XLeUflI2Lze7AX7yLOhToHYYQBqbuB6L0G1llan9ttS1-SKTZ1oiH_TjFZdSWIJoJAJlyVXNgTeYHRnOaeCz__z1MuOwECsu1QM7IH5MhHwKUVWQHsXZekWSUPgfoYS-FIcauqbVrTxR4jMwQdUZ03-PXGzzQwWFZXgdeoA6Ajl_A5IkOCf-YOuBKo87tevIAfxKJkVl5BVojJJo-NO8fTaDjmBE5UY8oxfqJORIMFr7fW4K1H5qfDPRgKok4jG6getJ7N3LkZV6981973xiwYAy6s7RdhZcMQ9Nb1o873dK9oXTg1HvHmHet2D--DcPOhk94WaD2zyKlNOJeZ5f31aw00vZ5RLUyhHgcB_uj-4GTvhTVZTHw45OqWXxy4_UBPr49vB0xpLkW6AJgI1VvxjYFU2O62syGg0uOlRJO3JcSF-ZO_3VsyaL-pc8GMRhlN_pM3dtMpa5zTFDAbaPKoB7FuScR_dQbaPEtR3w48UlFYwHp6ccfp5cvRT8mjYh7LIHdHdaoDU1p6Gx9i_nJM2z0AdN_3haZaH9nAM2Jd3WU1JtzMQ5OplvimgptRHpGxiza-ubhxDpEkefhwQUKXdXGEFih9xDPbw-DiSWsADdq_alhyBNj8y33EGaXUCTyHDJvMdKFus3CP8qnxtyHzlZfB_YNurQ_jTtZmQVs1N9uqVpBYc"&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt; for children, including that all children ages 6 months to 23 months should be fully vaccinated, saying they were vulnerable to severe cases of COVID. The recommendation, which relied heavily on the information gathered by the Vaccine Integrity Project,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;contradicted &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/19/nation/defying-rfk-jr-pediatric-group-urges-covid-shots-young-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/19/nation/defying-rfk-jr-pediatric-group-urges-covid-shots-young-kids/"&gt;Kennedy’s recommendation&lt;/a&gt; that healthy children older than 6 months should not get the shot. It was the first time in 30 years the pediatrics organization meaningfully departed from federal guidance. Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1957914911415153107?s=46&amp;amp;t=9AHxthXdGRIl37bvHR6MCg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1957914911415153107?s=46&amp;amp;t=9AHxthXdGRIl37bvHR6MCg"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; the organization of a “pay-to-play scheme,” saying it recommended the doses to benefit the pharmaceutical industry, and pointed to donations from some large pharma companies to a fund for children’s health the organization runs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This attack on the integrity of pediatricians is unfortunate, but it does not change the facts,” said Dr. Susan Kressly, the pediatrician academy’s president, in a statement. “Our immunization recommendations are rooted in decades of peer-reviewed science by the nation’s leading health experts.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There remain major obstacles to any effort to disentangle state vaccination policies from the federal government. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Osterholm’s Vaccine Integrity Project doesn’t have access to the unpublished studies, proprietary industry data, or ongoing trials without reported results the CDC can use to make vaccine recommendations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Private insurers rely on CDC recommendations to decide which vaccines they cover, though some have indicated they would be open to considering other scientific authorities. Pharmacists and clinicians, though, depend on federal programs to give them liability protection if patients have serious adverse reactions to vaccines. These protections only cover vaccines approved by the CDC, said Brigid Groves, vice president for professional affairs with the American Pharmacists Association, a trade organization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While the states that participated in this week’s assembly have no immediate plans to diverge from federal recommendations, a test may come soon. The CDC is overdue to issue COVID vaccine recommendations, and a meeting of the agency’s vaccine advisory committee is expected to happen in the coming weeks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“So much of this is unknown,” Goldstein said. “We haven’t seen how they’re going to structure their presentations and what they’re going to use to justify a decision.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Starting this fall, flu shots will be offered during its monthly blood screening events- providing a convenient, one-stop opportunity for preventive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why the Change?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decision to discontinue the drive-thru format comes in response to changing community needs and increased access to free flu shots at local pharmacies such as Walgreens, Walmart, and Dillon’s. While the HaysMed drive-thru clinic once served nearly 4,000 individuals annually, recent participation has dropped below 1,500. This new format allows the hospital to better align with current trends and improve accessibility for the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to Expect: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants can now receive a free flu shot, participate in blood screening lab draws, or do both- all in one visit. Flu shots will be available on the following Saturdays from 6:30 a.m. – 10:00a.m. at Entrance B (Miller Pavillion), using parking Lot B on September 6, October 4, or November 1, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children’s flu shots will be administered in the same area as adult vaccinations to simplify the experience for families. To help with flow and minimize wait times, participants may choose to go directly to the flu shot station or begin with blood screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, HaysMed has proudly administered 69,802 flu shots to the community. In 2024 alone, the hospital provided 1,300 adult and 378 pediatric vaccines free of charge, thanks to the support of the HaysMed Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HaysMed flu shot events have also supported local families through food donations. In 2024, participants donated 583 pounds of canned food to the Community Assistance Center. Since 2007, the hospital collected a total of 26,854 pounds- nearly 13.5 tons of food! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All attendees are encourage to bring a non-perishable food item to continue this tradition of giving back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the HaysMed 2025 Flu Shot video below about this change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HaysMed is thrilled to continue partnering with Fort Hays State University and Fort Hays North Central Tech nursing students, who will assist with flu shot administration. Their involvement ensures hands-on learning and reflects the spirit of community collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flu Shot Key Details:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Free flu shots available for individuals 6 months and older&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· No appointment necessary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Participants may choose to receive a flu shot, participate in blood screening lab draws, or both&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Consent forms available at &lt;a href="https://haysmedfoundation.org/flu/"&gt;haysmedfoundation.org/flu&lt;/a&gt; – please complete, print, and bring a signed copy for each person being vaccinated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Short-sleeved shirts recommended for ease of vaccination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Egg-free vaccines will not be available; individuals with egg allergies should consult their healthcare provider&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· High-dose flu vaccines for those 65+ will not be offered at these events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about blood screenings, visit the most recent &lt;a href="https://www.haysmed.com/august-volunteer-community-blood-screenings/"&gt;monthly blood screenings article&lt;/a&gt;.

Wells wanted to understand exactly how public health officials had contained measles outbreaks in the past, especially among communities similar to those of the Mennonite patients they were seeing initially in the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Immediately, she hit a snag: the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), normally a central resource for officials battling outbreaks like these, had been placed under a gag order by new Trump administration officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, Wells turned to the literature, reading everything she could find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She was familiar with the 2018-19 &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in New York City’s Orthodox Jewish communities, but it was an earlier episode that really caught her eye: a 2014 outbreak among Mennonites in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She sent an &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1602295" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about the Ohio outbreak to Zach Holbrooks, head of the public health department covering Gaines county, where the outbreak was centered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It seemed very similar to the culture of who we were working with in Gaines county,” Wells said. They spent the weekend “trying to figure out what we needed to do” before the cases were confirmed and announced to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-19m4xhf"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;I think there’s some stigma about getting vaccines&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Kathryn Wells, Lubbock's director of public health&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It took four months to quell the 2014 Ohio outbreak. The handful of cases pointing to a growing outbreak in Texas were unlikely to be resolved in a week or two, Wells said. “So we needed to make sure we were planning for the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They set up mass vaccination clinics, which were frequented more in Lubbock than in Gaines county. “I think there’s some stigma about getting vaccines,” Wells said – especially in highly visible places where news media tended to camp out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet vaccinations had worked well in Ohio to stop the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think they were able to do more going door to door and setting up smaller vaccination clinics and providing that education. We didn’t have the staffing available to us to do some of that,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is no cure for measles, but two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective at preventing the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In hesitant communities, though, it can be difficult to strike the right balance in talking about vaccines without alienating patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Yes, vaccines are the way to get us out of it, but when you’re working with a community that’s not hearing that, you need to find other messages” to help protect the community, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Officials in Texas put out information – about isolation and quarantine to help slow down the spread, and about seeking care at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There were concerns about people just staying away from the hospital because of fear that they might do something wrong for their child,” Wells said. They worked to get the message to parents: “If your child is really struggling [with] breathing, don’t delay – bring them into a hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wells wishes they had also created free treatment centers to provide medical support for families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In hindsight, we probably could have taken some local doctors and nurse practitioners and set up some kind of clinic for people to come to if their child was really sick, where we could check their oxygen level, talk about what can we do to keep the child from getting dehydrated, and assess whether or not a child needed to go into the hospital,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-19m4xhf"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Unfortunately, what you have now is a very corrupt health and wellness influencer industry&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We probably should have offered that service to the community at a free clinic, so that they also had a place to ask questions and get answers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, patients saw private medical providers – at least one of whom, Dr Ben Edwards, gained notoriety for his anti-vaccine views and treatments without an evidence base for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Unfortunately, what you have now is a very corrupt health and wellness influencer industry that is pushing interventions like that as an alternative to vaccination, and that’s not how it works,” said Hotez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Responding to people’s questions about vaccines takes time and requires “real conversations” to understand and address their concerns, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s a slow process. It’s going to take some of these one-on-one conversations – and then hopefully, if you change their mind, they’re going to be able to advocate to their friends and to the people they’re in contact with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the same time, Wells said, “we also need to make sure vaccines are easily available – not putting up barriers for people to get vaccinated when they want to”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the west Texas outbreak, Wells also suggested assembling teams of community health workers to educate their neighbors and encourage vaccination. But they didn’t have the money and time to do that, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Local health officials are well-suited to build relationships like these before crisis strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You need to have those relationships in place to work through whenever there’s a big pandemic or some kind of outbreak,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s a plan that helped with the Covid pandemic in Lubbock – identifying community leaders, including in churches, to create a “vaccine ambassador program” of lay people who helped others make vaccination appointments and arrange transportation, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Officials could also gather information about vaccination rates at the local level to predict in which areas and communities outbreaks may take root, Hotez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The problem that we have is the CDC does not track any childhood immunization rates at the county level,” Hotez said. “They only do state and national immunization levels, which is not adequate, because of the way measles operates – it strikes clusters in counties with really low vaccination rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To combat measles on the national level, the CDC could create a vaccination map of the country to understand where vulnerable pockets exist and begin health education campaigns tailored to those areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hotez co-authored a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002578" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 creating a map like this based on information from state health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It was pretty shocking when we saw these big patches of the country where kids were not getting vaccinated, and it was missed by the CDC because they were only looking at statewide immunization rates,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Idaho, for example, is at high risk for a widespread measles epidemic, Hotez said. “The whole state of Idaho looks like the same vaccination rates as those pockets in west Texas. So the vulnerability remains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last Tuesday, Idaho &lt;a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/08/14/measles-reported-in-eastern-idaho-becoming-states-second-case-in-one-week/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; two measles cases in areas that hadn’t seen the disease in three decades.

But before you put on your &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/plague-doctors-beaked-masks-coronavirus" target="_blank"&gt;17th century “air-purifying” beaked mask&lt;/a&gt;, let’s find out from the experts why this disease is still around and how dangerous it is now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people associate the term “plague” with the massive and destructive event that killed 25 million Europeans in the Middle Ages, said professor John Swartzberg of UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health. In the 14th century, the plague killed &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-bright-side-of-the-black-death" target="_blank"&gt;as much as 50%&lt;/a&gt; of Europe’s population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The plague is really a specific disease that has ... in our human history [reared] its ugly head and caused massive deaths,” said Swartzberg, who works in the university’s Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be a threat of the past, but it continues to be a very serious disease, with a small number of cases every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the recent case of the South Lake Tahoe resident, it’s believed the person &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-19/california-resident-tests-positive-for-plague-officials-blame-lake-tahoe-flea"&gt;contracted the rare disease after being bitten by an infected flea&lt;/a&gt; while camping in the area, according to El Dorado County health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent case before this one was reported in El Dorado County in 2020 and also was believed to have been transmitted in the same area, officials said. Two plague cases were &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-plague-yosemite-20150819-story.html"&gt;reported in California in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, suspected to have been caused by bites from an infected flea or rodent in Yosemite National Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though medical advancements have made the deadly disease treatable, it hasn’t been eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="contracting-the-plague-even-today" class="subhead"&gt;Contracting the plague, even today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plague is caused by the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Yersinia pestis &lt;/i&gt;and primarily affects small animals or rodents in the United States, Swartzberg said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three types of the plague: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;bubonic plague, with the trademark swollen lymph nodes; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;septicemic plague, when the infection spreads throughout the body; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pneumonic plague, which infects the lungs. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can spread to humans and pets from the bite of an infected flea or from coming into close contact with, or handling, an infected rodent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plague was introduced to the U.S. in the early 20th century from rat-infested steamships arriving in California from Asia, with the first case identified in the San Francisco area, Swartzberg said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, the last known case of rat-associated plague occurred in Los Angeles in the 1920s, according to county public health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principal source of plague in Los Angeles County today is wild rodents in rural areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who do contract the plague do so while hiking or camping, and in these areas they are unknowingly bitten by an infected flea, said Ashok Chopra, professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas Medical Branch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals live in much greater concentrations in rural areas, where they are in closer proximity to other creatures and habitats, making it easier for the bacterium to thrive, Swartzberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodland creatures that could carry the disease and should be avoided include chipmunks, wood rats, mice and marmots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="where-the-plague-could-be-contracted-in-socal" class="subhead"&gt;Where the plague could be contracted in SoCal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, public health officials say the plague occurs in the foothills, plateaus, mountains and along the coast. It’s largely absent from the southeastern desert region and the Central Valley. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is the potential for exposure throughout Los Angeles County, but areas where the risk is highest are the rural recreational and wilderness areas of the Angeles National Forest and San Gabriel Mountains, county officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People and their pets can get the plague if they visit or live in areas where wild rodents are naturally infected, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/Facts%20Plague.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Los Angeles County Public Health Department&lt;/a&gt;. People who live in close contact with rats also are at greater risk of getting the disease from the possibly infected rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn’t uncommon for dogs and cats to become infected because pets do get fleas. An infected flea, although rare, can sicken pets, which are vulnerable to the disease, Chopra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-the-plague-has-stuck-around" class="subhead"&gt;Why the plague has stuck around&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has eradicated only one human infectious disease, which is smallpox, and that was done through vaccination, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/about/history.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been several vaccine candidates to ward off the plague, but at this time there aren’t any Food and Drug Administration-approved inoculations for the disease, Chopra said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know how to eradicate an infection in a mammalian population that’s spread by a vector like fleas,” Swartzberg said, “so I don’t see us being able to eradicate this at this time in our history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the plague isn’t a top priority for infectious-disease experts or public health officials because it’s under control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Elimination means the infection is gone in a geographic area and there’s no localized transmission,” Swartzberg added, “so we’ve pretty much eliminated the plague as a serious problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how much should we worry? If we get treatment in a timely manner, there’s little to fear, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plague can be treated with antibiotics, Chopra said, but if left untreated it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the infection is overwhelming,” he said, “then the bacteria can spread fairly quickly into the bloodstream, and then it becomes very dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Times staff writer Clara Harter contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOVUMyWWxfSWdRMjdJaVE3YnMxQ3ZlbmIzaVhlX2xMYXZNVkdrZXdTSWNOSHhadVptalV6V3JGdUVyZ3JJOWRUaWhHQWdGbkhIY2kwVElpTG9KNnVjWmJxQUpVcEpBR0E0Zk9ia3puaXNxMTFDX1hyU2k0RUlBTzhoTy1KeG56OThRV0pNR3c4YjV6Y2U1dEhiRHA4TlFzVWlOeV9jNS01WXFBdlN5Mnc</guid></item><item><title>一位阿尔茨海默氏症研究人员分享了他为大脑健康向每个人推荐的1种每日补充剂和1种口头禅- Business Insider</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNeFRPTFJDSTJOazhUXzk1TmRKcXd6czBOcDRqdjlXQjdpdC05eElremF1c3lOZktDMXB1Rm16M19LdXJZRkxVaTcwdnp6REpWVk95TXQ4bXVhQjFqNzFUSlJqRGRjMThndFhxWDF5OG5menhCZHJhbUhRZmhxMy1qLWEwQkd3M1NpTmV1TW1jTWRVclAtMkNLZXVlNUNwaFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="post-body-content post-story-body-content" data-component-type="post-body-content" data-load-strategy="exclude" data-track-content="" data-post-type="story" data-track-marfeel="post-body-content"&gt;
            
                &lt;p&gt;If Dr. Rudolph Tanzi has learned anything from his many years of research, it is that nothing helps the brain more than healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if you're taking supplements, nothing substitutes for lifestyle," Tanzi, the director of Genetics and Aging Research at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of child neurology at Harvard Medical School, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanzi, who is entering clinical trials for his own supplement brand &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cognishield.com/pages/about-the-science" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;CogniSHIELD&lt;/a&gt;, said "SHIELD" is a reference to an acronym he came up with to encourage &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-neuroscientists-do-to-keep-brain-healthy-2023-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;good brain health&lt;/a&gt; and potentially reduce the risk of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facing-early-onset-alzheimers-how-family-copes-with-genetic-fate-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and other cognitive issues down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He shared why he recommends SHIELD to everyone and one daily supplement he takes to boost his &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-salad-greens-are-good-for-brain-health-aging-2024-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="0217ce4c-c7a6-491e-8c83-d549c98a572f" data-toc-id="0217ce4c-c7a6-491e-8c83-d549c98a572f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A mantra for great brain health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="0217ce4c-c7a6-491e-8c83-d549c98a572f"&gt;Tanzi broke down what SHIELD stands for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;leep for 7-8 hours a night to clear harmful protein buildup, such as amyloid plaques. "The faster you make amyloid, the sooner you get Alzheimer's," Tanzi said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;andle stress. "Chronic stress causes chronic inflammation," he said. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/mental-health/benefits-of-meditation" rel=""&gt;Being more mindful&lt;/a&gt; can reduce the chances of cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;nteract with others. Loneliness &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-loneliness-does-to-the-body-and-brain-2023-12" rel=""&gt;negatively impacts the brain&lt;/a&gt; — and increases the risk of Alzheimer's "twofold," Tanzi said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;xercise to encourage &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/exercise-new-nerve-cell-growth-alzheimers-disease" rel=""&gt;nerve cell growth&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dissolve amyloid buildup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L&lt;/strong&gt;earn new things. "The more synapses you make in life, it's like money in the bank," Tanzi said. Keeping busy and having hobbies are also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tips-for-living-to-100-from-centenarians-worlds-oldest-people-2024-6" rel=""&gt;linked to greater longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;iet, such as the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mediterranean-diet-best-healthy-eating-longevity-rankings-2025-1" rel=""&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;. Tanzi recommended focusing on plants to balance the gut microbiome. While Tanzi said more research is needed to understand why a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dietitian-shares-best-high-fiber-recipes-better-energy-gut-health-2025-1" rel=""&gt;healthy gut&lt;/a&gt; is linked to the removal of amyloid, he said a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-fiber-high-protein-food-plant-based-sources-nutritionist-2025-4" rel=""&gt;high-fiber&lt;/a&gt; diet rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains definitely helps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="888537f5-8b0b-4a89-a988-d345be956c2d" data-toc-id="888537f5-8b0b-4a89-a988-d345be956c2d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He takes omega-3 for slower brain aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

For example, in a 2025 study of 777 participants, those who took a gram of omega-3 a day experienced slower brain aging. The effect was more pronounced for people who also exercised and took vitamin D supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While omega-3 can be found in foods like &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/omega-3-foods" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;salmon and chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, taking supplements like fish oil can help make up for any dietary deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanzi, a vegetarian, takes daily vegan omega-3 supplements made from algae. For people looking into &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/fish-oil-benefits" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;fish oil&lt;/a&gt; supplements, he advised doing research on the brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he likes brands like Centrum and Nordic Naturals (he has no affiliations with either) because of their distilling processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oceans, unfortunately, are filthy," he said. Some companies may not be adequately filtering their fish oil to get toxic heavy metals like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fish-higher-amounts-of-mercury-than-others-2019-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt; or cadmium out.

Her grandmother died of complications from RA, and in the last few months of her life, it was Smith who served as her caregiver, administering doses of &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.arthritis.org/drug-guide/medication-topics/understanding-methotrexate" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:methotrexate;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;methotrexate&lt;/a&gt; to treat her pain and inflammation. The drug, a form of chemotherapy also used to treat cancer, is so potent that Smith had to wear gloves to safely give it to her grandmother. So, when Smith’s doctor told her she too would probably have to take methotrexate long-term, her heart sank. “That was so scary for me,” she tells Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Smith’s RA and weight — 311 pounds — were “double negatives” against her health, her doctor said. She &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;to lose the weight. And so Smith started following the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/health/wellness/nutrition/healthy-eating/article/mediterranean-diet-meager-budget-can-you-dupe-the-worlds-healthiest-meal-plans-100049940.html" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, losing 5 or 6 pounds in the process. But that wasn’t nearly enough to alleviate the excessive inflammation and pain in her joints during flare-ups, which could last as long as four months. Smith was in constant pain. Some days, she couldn’t go to work. Other times, she was physically incapable of playing with her 4-year-old daughter. “It was stress on top of stress, and those are some of the main triggers of a flare,” Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;GLP-1 weight loss medications haven’t been approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis. But they’ve &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4823510/#:~:text=It%20was%20reported%20that%20GLP,on%20its%20anti%2Dinflammatory%20actions." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:demonstrated great power to reduce inflammation;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;demonstrated great power to reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. While Smith’s insurance wouldn’t cover the medication (deeming it for “cosmetic weight loss”), she got a prescription for &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/millions-of-people-are-taking-compounded-weight-loss-drugs-now-theyre-about-to-disappear-202621562.html" data-ylk="slk:compounded semaglutide;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;compounded semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; from a local provider and, later, compounded tirzepatide from an online provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Seven months later, Smith, 30, hasn’t had a single arthritis flare-up. “I’ve been able to come off my rheumatoid arthritis medicines — and these are medications that people &lt;em&gt;never &lt;/em&gt;come off of,” she says. It’s the biggest way that Smith’s life has changed since starting a GLP-1, but far from the only shift. For this installment of the Yahoo series &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/tagged/on-my-weigh/" data-ylk="slk:On My Weigh;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On My Weigh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Smith explains in her own words how the medication has helped her teach her daughter healthy eating habits and given her the clarity she needed to leave the teaching job that had burned her out. “Since being on a GLP-1, I put myself and my mental and physical health first,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassandra Smith has lost nearly 70 pounds since starting tirzepatide.

She was missing out, and I just wanted to change that and be able to play with her. And I wanted to get off of methotrexate, the potent medication I was taking for my rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress report: &lt;/strong&gt;I feel amazing. My inflammation levels are down, I’m happier and I haven’t had a single arthritis flare-up since I’ve been on tirzepatide. I’m full of energy, I’m back to loving going out and dressing up — I just see myself. I’ve lost 69 pounds in seven months, and the other day I was able to put a towel all the way around me to cover up. I don’t think I’d been able to do that since high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food noise volume: &lt;/strong&gt;Before starting tirzepatide, my food noise was an 8 out of 10. Until recently, I was a full-time schoolteacher, plus I’m a full-time mom and girlfriend to a full-time musician. Staying busy kept my food noise at bay. But when I did want to eat, I wanted to eat the wrong way. Now that I’m on a GLP-1, I can’t say my food noise is completely gone. But it’s at about a 3, and when I do have cravings, it’s for taco salad, or soup or broccoli. It’s very weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="day-in-the-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day in the life &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="rise-and-shine"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rise and shine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Prior to my GLP-1 journey, I woke up in pain every morning. I had to wait about 15 minutes before I could physically get up and move out of bed. I was so angry at my body. I felt like I was too young to be waking up in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I just jump up. I wake up at 5:15 a.m., go to the bathroom and jump on the scale. Then I tell my social media followers, “Good morning, this is going to be a good day.” I get my daughter up at about 6:30 a.m. I’m happy, and I go into her room refreshed because I’ve gotten a good night’s rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="first-bites"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First bites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I used to have a bacon, egg and cheese croissant, hash browns and a large iced coffee from Burger King or McDonald’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I might get similar things when I eat breakfast out, but I no longer get full combo meals. I don’t drink coffee or sodas. I just have hydration packets in my water that I bring from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At home, I make eggs with some kind of meat or protein. Sometimes I’ll still have a croissant, but I purchase them from Sam’s Club now. They have fewer calories and 16 grams of protein. Even though I’m not always cooking, what I’m eating is better-quality food. And I make sure I’m always getting protein with breakfast. I’m setting myself up for success with that first bite, rather than eating those potatoes and iced coffee that are going to have me crashing by 12 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="get-ready-with-me"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get ready with me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before, everything I wore was very dark. We all know that black covers up everything. I would just throw on some sweatpants or joggers and just go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I actually care what I look like. I wake up earlier, because I want to have time to choose colors that I feel good and comfortable in. I like to wear a lot of different patterns. Prior to my major weight gain, I used to be a girl who loved heels. I’m slowly getting back into heels and jewelry, because I feel beautiful again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="make-a-move"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For about four years, before I started my GLP-1 journey, I had a gym membership that I never used. Now I know that gym life just isn’t for me. I’ll go every now and again, but it’s not a long-term solution because it’s not something that I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But now I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; in a season where I want to do things that I enjoy &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;that are good for me. Since starting my GLP-1, I’ve canceled my gym membership. Instead, I’ve been trying to incorporate things that I can maintain into my day-to-day routine — things like taking daily walks with my daughter and going to the park and playing with her. I have weights, a squat machine, a sit-up machine and a foldable elliptical all at home. When I feel like it, I go downstairs and work out. But I don’t want to put myself back in a position where I’m doing things just because people say I should. I want to be the captain of my own boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="dose-time"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dose time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I’m actually on a &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peptide-stacking-latest-viral-wellness-162349352.html" data-ylk="slk:whole peptide stack;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;whole peptide stack&lt;/a&gt;, which is a set of several injections my doctor prescribed to help optimize my health. So, every Monday, I take my tirzepatide, Lipo-C [an amino acid and vitamin injection that is &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/using-fat-dissolving-injections-are-not-fda-approved-can-be-harmful" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:not approved by the Food and Drug Administration;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;not approved by the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; but has &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3486781/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shown some promise for weight loss in research;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;shown some promise for weight loss in research&lt;/a&gt;] and anti-aging &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/healthy-aging/longevity/articles/nad-does-help-longevity-164617662.html" data-ylk="slk:NAD+;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;NAD+&lt;/a&gt; injections. Wednesday, I take the NAD+, Friday, I take NAD+ and Lipo-C. I feel like I have a really good stack, and it is prescribed by a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; doctor. I think it helps me to feel like the best version of myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I consider Sunday nights my cheat night. I’ll eat something more fatty than usual, like a taco salad (but I’ll actually eat the shell), or I’ll have Olive Garden cheese ravioli with marinara sauce. I try to give my body something to eat the night before I take my medications. My cravings are stronger right before my shot days. But I’ve been able to train myself to be disciplined while having grace for myself and understand that it’s OK to eat things that you enjoy. Plus, now I crave things that I love &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;that are healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith is more active — and wearing bright colors — since starting a GLP-1. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Getty, courtesy of Cassandra Smith)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="lets-do-lunch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s do lunch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My pre-GLP-1 lunch was a burger, some fried chicken nuggets, hot wings — anything fried, that was quick to grab-and-go or pick up from the drive-through. Cooking was just never my concern back then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now I actually take the time to cook instead, because I’ve realized that if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. A typical lunch these days is whatever I didn’t eat the night before for dinner. We all know that those of us on GLP-1s don’t eat as much and we always have leftovers. So, I’ve learned to love them. I never used to eat them, because I was going to fast food restaurants a lot — and who wants to eat McDonald’s the next day? Every now and then I’ll splurge and get some sushi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="happy-hour"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy hour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before starting tirzepatide, I didn’t really feel like I had free time. I spent a lot of it sleeping. I felt mentally drained from dealing with kids all day (much as I love them) and crashing from what I ate. I would get home and just sleep. I called it hibernation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I feel like I have more time — and did even before I quit my job. I enjoy going to Ulta and looking at new skin care, or going window-shopping at TJ Maxx. I know I’m still transitioning sizes, so I restrain myself from buying too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Any time spent with my child is quality time for me. But now it’s actually quality time for &lt;em&gt;her.&lt;/em&gt; She doesn’t have to just sit in bed and watch TV because that’s all I physically can do. We’re going to the park, we go on nature walks, we go to my parents’ house in the middle of the week because I have the energy to drive there, instead of being too drained because I ate potatoes in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The quantity of time with her hasn’t changed, but the quality of it has changed drastically. It’s more intentional, and she gains more out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="dinner-bell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner bell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I never had enough time in the day to really focus on what to eat before my GLP-1 journey. It was just, &lt;em&gt;Throw it in the microwave, throw it in the oven. &lt;/em&gt;When I went out for dinner,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I used to love to get steak. But when I found out that I had rheumatoid arthritis, steak would cause me to flare. So I stopped eating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, my go-to protein is salmon, with a veggie, and they’re both cooked in my house. As soon as I began taking tirzepatide, I started to make sure protein was in every single thing I was eating. That first month or so, I tracked everything. But I learned how much protein and how many calories were in the things I was eating — as people on GLP-1s, we eat the same things over and over — and it just became second nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My doctor taught me to stay on the outside aisles of the store when I go to the grocery store. As long as you stay on those walls, you’re eating fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, fresh meats and fresh eggs. If you’re buying food from the center of the store, the more sodium and calories you’re getting in those processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Having a 4-year-old daughter, it’s so exciting for me to be able to raise her in a way that I wish I had been raised. Cooking is a whole activity for us, and for her, cooking healthy food will be normal. I get to create that generational knowledge with my daughter and save her from having to be on a GLP-1 later, because she has had the opportunity to learn to eat the right things from the beginning. She asks if we’re having salmon and broccoli for dinner. Today, my sister picked my daughter and my nephew up and they went to McDonald’s. My daughter didn’t want anything. She understands, at 4 years old, that we don’t eat that. My mom makes treats for major events, and sometimes she’ll eat some of the extras. My daughter will be like, “Grandma, you shouldn’t eat that!” My mom says, “Get this little girl, she’s doing too much!” But I love it. I know that, even when I’m not present, the things I taught her still matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="lets-get-the-bill"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s get the bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before I started taking tirzepatide, I was spending a lot of money eating out every day with my daughter. At Chick-fil-A, we were spending $25 on one meal. It added up to about $800 a month. And on top of that was the junk I was buying at the grocery store to stock up the house. It probably totaled about $1,200 a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Luckily, Shed, my provider, has really good prices for GLP-1s. I spend about $300 a month on my medications. Ultimately, I’m saving money. My budget is better, and I’m able to invest more and help the people around me more because I’m not going out every day spending money on food. The bill is amazing. I love the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 09:00:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-AFBVV95cUxPR1Q1NzhBUHp6TGJ0akl6X0N6QlZPS0J0eXE2Nmh6UFIyaFZlb0tIeFFKNXdqakdEQm8zQWRSUlF5eE5nQm1abGxSMmRackFsWnAxVG45ZktnS01VMHloRGhXcEdZWFc3MmZCY01fTm5WTUV6akxOdTd5RWI1UDgyWGQzOWFEalQ0NkpFRE5pd1hRNUJnc3lQQWwwZzlfZ3VadDNScGV3Mm1peVdoM1dmWVdLeFYyUHRxYUJJcWRXMGF4VGl5V2VmMTB3V0V3VmRvNWwwdjR6S0lmelc5VlVHY3BVUy1nWkRkLWxDZmxqV0N3NFI4SzVTbg</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎疫苗接种的秋季药房之旅可能布满障碍- Politico</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPTVBxSUdxc3lBdlpsVi00RklDbFdOdGVzSkhUT3B1TnByZE9oaFAwckRtSUZ4Q2NZV0lqT1lqbXJCMjJ2bXFhWG9zdzh0UWZfQ2twb0Q1OXRMSEVwZ2dfYVd3TTNKcWRGVEVhd1d0dDBOY1ZmTEJUYUVsLU5CTlNKQUMydWltSDh6TFh2SDJ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Politico</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPTVBxSUdxc3lBdlpsVi00RklDbFdOdGVzSkhUT3B1TnByZE9oaFAwckRtSUZ4Q2NZV0lqT1lqbXJCMjJ2bXFhWG9zdzh0UWZfQ2twb0Q1OXRMSEVwZ2dfYVd3TTNKcWRGVEVhd1d0dDBOY1ZmTEJUYUVsLU5CTlNKQUMydWltSDh6TFh2SDJ3</guid></item><item><title>可以在其轨道上阻止癌症的新疫苗和治疗方法- The i Paper</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQWTRuUFl5ZV9YRVZSckF6VXpQNmMxWVNjYm1QWk54SUd3NTVLZVhvTHNWN1kwemJJS3BheThLN19ReWszdVNpU21tM0JkS0NnQ180a29Pa3J6MERVcUVWN3dFYjJzc2M2bFJnTXhHajF0a0RjYmkzM3d1S2ZsQlA3WGlSS19tQjZQQnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="inews__post-excerpt"&gt;
					The next advances in defeating cancer may come from a surprising place - our own natural defence mechanisms					                &lt;/p&gt;
				        &lt;div class="inews__post-content entry-content article-content"&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="post_in-line_link" href="https://inews.co.uk/topic/cancer?ico=in-line_link"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most feared of all medical conditions, is often seen as an unstoppable force. But in fact, the opposite is true. It is common for our bodies to successfully eradicate early cancers without us even noticing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By middle age, most of us probably have several microscopic tumours dotted around the body that are in the process of being destroyed by the immune system. It is only when cancers start beating our immune defences that they grow to a noticeable size and cause symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a tumour has reached this stage, while the &lt;a class="post_in-line_link" href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/the-truth-about-boosting-your-immune-system-fighting-viruses-819001?ico=in-line_link"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; battle continues, the cancer is much more likely to win. Yet many scientists believe the fact that the immune system can defeat at least some early cancers suggests it could hold the secret to developing better treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="inews__shorts"&gt;&lt;span class="inews__post__label inews__post__label-new-feature"&gt;New Feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="inews__shorts__title"&gt;In Short&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="inews__shorts__strap"&gt;Quick Stories. Same trusted journalism.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last decade or so, they have been developing a range of different measures aimed at harnessing the immune system’s cancer-killing powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include genetically modified immune cells that are precision-engineered to wipe out tumours, as well as vaccines that could mean dangerous cells are killed even before they are classed as cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our immune systems are already doing this. We’re just giving them a bump to do it better,” said Professor Sarah Blagden, an oncologist&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;at the University of Oxford, who is involved in this research. “This is a totally different way of thinking about cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Better survival rates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of medical history, cancer therapies ignored our immune systems, using more the direct approaches of surgery to cut out the tumour, then &lt;a class="post_in-line_link" href="https://inews.co.uk/topic/chemotherapy?srsltid=AfmBOooOWxUAywNG7aqQQx8kjqrFt7Bzuo4_3IwUMYYdZYzMMyEICVvd&amp;amp;ico=in-line_link"&gt;chemotherapy &lt;/a&gt;and radiotherapy to poison any remaining cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progressive improvements to these approaches have led to better survival rates, with about half of people now surviving for at least a decade after a cancer diagnosis (see graphic), a length of time that is usually seen as signifying a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We became aware of the immune system’s potential after noticing that immune cells are present inside and next to tumours, often actively fighting the tumour cells, even when someone is dying from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathologists have also long noted that post-mortems of people who had died from other causes sometimes reveal small tumours that had not been noticed during life, suggesting the immune system was successfully keeping them at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the more detailed an examination of a certain organ takes place, the more likely it is to turn up either microscopic tumours or clumps of cells that look suspiciously pre-cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found that for instance, &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-017-3808-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;two in 10 women&lt;/a&gt; had an unnoticed breast cancer or pre-cancer at the time of death, while an estimated six in 10 men who were 80 or older had &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.29538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;unnoticed prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is impossible to know the total number of pre-cancers we may have, “it is likely that someone in their fifties has multiple pre-cancers in their bodies that are [being] held in check”, said Professor Blagden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system’s role is usually seen as wiping out invading pathogens like bacteria and viruses, but several types of immune cells – including ones called T-cells – can recognise and destroy cancer cells, due to their mutations that let them multiply faster than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as cancers grow they also acquire mutations that let them evade the normal immune defences in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one recently arrived group of cancer drugs, called &lt;a class="post_in-line_link" href="https://inews.co.uk/news/science/immune-system-trained-drug-resistant-cancers-study-559868?ico=in-line_link"&gt;checkpoint inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;, work by blocking proteins that act as a brake on the immune system, although these medicines do not work for everyone.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genetically engineered immune attack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other ways of harnessing the immune system may be more effective. One approach has given promising results for when cancer arises in cells that belong to a different branch of the immune system: B-cells, the cells that make antibodies to fight off pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, a high-tech treatment for leukaemia involves doctors taking a blood sample from the patient, extracting their cancer-killing T-cells, and adding a gene that means they seek out and destroy B-cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some patients, these altered cells, now called CAR-T cells, survive and multiply, and have been detected in the blood – still killing off the cancerous B-cells – for more than 10 years after they were injected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was a really big breakthrough,” said Dr Dani Edmunds, research information manager at Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has proven tougher to make CAR-T cells that work against solid cancers, like a breast or colon tumour, as opposed to the blood cancer leukaemia, perhaps because it is harder for them to get inside the tumour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this summer, a CAR-T cell therapy against cancers of the stomach was found to help people live somewhat longer – from 5.5 months to 8 months – in a &lt;a href="https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2025/05/31/asco-2025-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;small randomised trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the benefit was modest, this is the first such success for CAR-T cells in solid tumours and so could be “an important step forward”, said Dr Catherine Elliott, CRUK’s director of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Vaccines as treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system intervention we are most familiar with is vaccination – when we are injected with, for instance, a weakened virus, which teaches our body to fight it off when we meet the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has inspired some scientists to try to use a similar approach to help rev up the immune response against cancer. This is called a “therapeutic vaccine” to distinguish it from the way that vaccines are usually used as prevention against illnesses, not therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several therapeutic cancer vaccines are in trials, including ones for cancers of the bowel, skin and head and neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, NHS England signalled that it sees cancer vaccines as so promising they should be a top research priority, by setting up a system to help patients get into a vaccine trial if there is one for their type of tumour, called the &lt;a class="post_in-line_link" href="https://inews.co.uk/news/15-nhs-hospitals-game-changing-cancer-vaccines-rolled-out-first-3850205?ico=in-line_link"&gt;Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immense research effort that went into making&lt;a class="post_in-line_link" href="https://inews.co.uk/topic/covid-19-vaccines?srsltid=AfmBOopvAV2u0JgXkYz3sQSYMuIzU_PMjVJXdhjhKZmpSJ3TtpKmcPA2&amp;amp;ico=in-line_link"&gt; Covid vaccines&lt;/a&gt; has helped here, with some of the cancer vaccines being based on similar technologies, including ones based on mRNA made by BioNTech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Vaccines to stop cancer from starting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as therapeutic cancer vaccines, scientists such as Professor Blagden are trying to develop vaccines for cancer in the traditional sense, in that they would prevent a cancer from starting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This aims to eliminate the cells when they have some pre-cancerous mutations but have not become a full-blown cancer. This stage may last for decades before the cells eventually accumulate enough mutations to overcome the immune attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pre-cancerous mutations make the cells look slightly different to the immune system and this could be enhanced if the immune system is given a nudge by the right vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccines alert the immune system to recognise&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;several different mutations, to give the best chance of catching all pre-cancerous cells. They are being developed against cancers of the lung, breast, bowel and endometrium, the lining of the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, just a few such vaccines may be able to protect against a much bigger number of different tumours because the same pre-cancerous mutations are involved in most of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I want to do eventually is merge all of these vaccines into one vaccine that we give the population to protect them from cancer, perhaps in their thirties or forties,” said Professor Blagden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it could not defeat every single type of cancer, it could perhaps prevent most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Vaccine against all cancers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea of an “All Vax”, as  Professor Blagden is tentatively calling it, may sound overly ambitious, but the Oxford team already has £70m of investment from two major pharmaceutical companies (which she cannot yet reveal) in their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inews__shortcode-relatedarticleinline inews__post inews__post-teaser" id="color-context-related-article-3818911" data-post-id="3818911"&gt;&lt;div class="inews__shortcode-relatedarticleinline__content"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Read Next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a class="inews__post-teaser__media" href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/cancer-appointments-risk-delay-doctors-strike-3818911" title="Cancer appointments at risk of delay due to doctors strike"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SEI_257020471.jpg?crop=213px%2C143px%2C781px%2C441px&amp;amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Cancer appointments at risk of delay due to doctors strike"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And whether or not the All Vax comes to fruition, the increasing focus on pre-cancers and the immune system may yield other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a test for pre-cancers that detects the immune response to them in the blood is being developed in the hope it will work for multiple kinds of tumours. This could allow earlier treatment with better chance of a cure, said researcher Dr Victoria Goss at the University of Southampton.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Swedish firm called Elypta is working on a &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2115328119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;urine test for multiple tumours&lt;/a&gt;, which gives a positive result up to five years before people get a cancer diagnosis. This may work partly by detecting the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Professor Blagden, the only strange thing is that we have previously overlooked this area’s potential. “It’s quite shocking that this kind of prequel to cancer exists and has so far been largely ignored by medicine,” she said. “If effective, we could make cancer a disease of the past and not of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;In August 2023, downed power lines on Maui, Hawaii, sparked a wildfire that quickly exploded into multiple, fast-moving blazes &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/maui-wildfires-power-outage-911-service-1850721097"&gt;fanned by high winds&lt;/a&gt;. Over several days, the fires reduced much of the town of Lāhainā to ashes, displacing thousands and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/death-toll-of-maui-wildfires-rises-to-106-people-1850742926"&gt;killing more than 100 people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research published Thursday, August 22, in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2025.1611198/full"&gt;Frontiers in Climate&lt;/a&gt; suggests this disaster also caused a population-wide increase in mortality beyond what the official death count captured. By calculating the all-cause excess fatality rate—how many more deaths took place over a given period than expected—scientists found a 67% increase in the local mortality rate for August 2023. During the deadliest week of the blaze, the local death rate was 367% higher than expected. These findings underscore a need for improved disaster preparedness that incorporates Native Hawaiian ecological knowledge, the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What excess death rate reveals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking at the excess death rate offered a fuller picture of the fire’s impact, co-first author Michelle Nakatsuka, a medical student and researcher at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, told Gizmodo in an email. “The official numbers mostly count direct causes, like burns or smoke inhalation, but excess deaths capture [the] true toll better by telling us how many more people died than would have otherwise been expected in the month of the Lāhainā fires,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Disasters like wildfires often cause deaths in indirect ways that affect communities over time. When clinics shut down and roads are blocked off, people can’t refill their prescriptions or get dialysis treatments, Nakatsuka explained. Stress and displacement can worsen chronic conditions, and power or communication failures can delay emergency responses. “These impacts are amplified in under-resourced settings and [are] disproportionately suffered by vulnerable groups, like the elderly or people of color,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The tragic toll of the Maui fires&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even with this knowledge, Nakatsuka and her colleagues were surprised by the increase in excess mortality during the month of August 2023. Their analysis included all causes of death except covid-19. “While we anticipated an increase in excess deaths, seeing more than 80 additional deaths in the month of the Lāhainā fires was striking,” Nakatsuka said. “It was also surprising to see that the proportion of those deaths occurring outside of medical settings was larger than expected,” she added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the number of deaths that didn’t take place in a medical context—such as the emergency room—rose from 68% in previous months to 80% in August 2023. These people died in homes or public locations, suggesting that many were unable to reach medical care because of the fires.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A path to resilience&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While all-cause excess mortality is useful for correlating increased fatalities with natural disasters, it offers little insight into the details of these deaths, Nakatsuka clarified. “The main limitation here is that we can’t say exactly which deaths were caused by the fires or look into Lāhainā-specific excess mortality; we can only measure the overall increase in deaths,” she said, adding that future research should analyze death records alongside medical and toxicology reports to identify causes of death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, these findings reveal a need to improve Maui’s disaster preparedness and invest in wildfire mitigation strategies rooted in Indigenous knowledge, Nakatsuka said. “Native Hawaiian practices center around caring for the land (mālama ʻāina) in ways that naturally reduce fire risk, like restoring native plants, maintaining diverse ecosystems, and managing water resources,” she said. “Bringing Indigenous knowledge together with modern climate prediction tools will minimize risk of future climate crises and center the community’s voice at the heart of disaster prevention and recovery efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr wants a study about vaccines retracted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Sipa US via Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;US health secretary and vaccine sceptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr has called for the retraction of a Danish study that found no link between aluminium in vaccines and chronic diseases in children — a rare move for a US public official. Aluminium has been used for almost a century to enhance the immune system’s response to some vaccines. But some people claim the ingredient is linked to rising rates of childhood disorders such as autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public-health officials in Kennedy’s position rarely request that studies be retracted, says Ivan Oransky, a specialist in academic publishing and co-founder of the media organization Retraction Watch. Through this request, “Secretary Kennedy has demonstrated that he wants the scientific literature to bend to his will”, says Oransky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in question, published in &lt;i&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/i&gt; in July, is one of the largest of its kind, looking at 1.2 million children born over more than two decades in Denmark. The authors reported that no significant risk of developing autoimmune, allergic or neurodevelopmental disorders was associated with exposure to aluminium compounds in vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/flawed-science-bought-conclusions-the-aluminum-vaccine-study-the-media-wont-question-aaec2793" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/flawed-science-bought-conclusions-the-aluminum-vaccine-study-the-media-wont-question-aaec2793" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; published on TrialSite News on 1 August, Kennedy called into question the study’s methodology, analysis and results. Since his appointment as head of the US Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01852-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01852-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;bypassed normal scientific review processes&lt;/a&gt; to change vaccine recommendations and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02612-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02612-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;terminated grants&lt;/a&gt; for projects on mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/i&gt; says it stands by the study and has no plans to retract it. Christine Laine, editor in chief for the journal, wrote in a comment on the study’s web page on 11 August that “retraction is warranted only when serious errors invalidate findings or there is documented scientific misconduct, neither of which occurred here”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services said that Kennedy’s article spoke for itself, and that the department did not have any further comment in response to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;’s questions about Kennedy's request for a retraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Widely used&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aluminium, in the form of salts, such as potassium aluminium sulfate, have been administered in vaccines — for diseases ranging from whooping cough to pneumonia — to millions of people worldwide, and the vaccines have been widely studied for safety issues&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Gary Grohmann, an independent virologist in Canberra, says there is no evidence of significant side effects caused by the small amount of aluminium in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 2011, a study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry&lt;/i&gt; claimed to show a causal relationship between rising autism diagnoses in children and increased exposure to aluminium-containing vaccines. In 2012, the World Health Organization’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety said the study and another by the same authors were “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety/topics/adjuvants" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.who.int/groups/global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety/topics/adjuvants" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;seriously flawed&lt;/a&gt;” because they used inappropriate study designs, incorrect assumptions and questionable data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Grohmann says, the claim that aluminium in vaccines causes autism has been debunked “again and again”. “If there was a mechanism of action where a particular vaccine caused autism, we’d see it in 80, 90, 100% of people receiving the vaccine, and we don’t,” he says. Any association between autism and vaccines is probably a coincidence of timing, he says. “In other words, vaccines might be given at the age of two, and autism genetically might also kick in at the age of two,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cheng, an epidemiologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, says the Danish study adds to the evidence that vaccines containing aluminium are safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kennedy’s concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Kennedy’s criticisms of the Danish study are that the analysis excluded children who had died before the age of two. According to Kennedy, this means that the children “most likely to reveal injuries” associated with aluminum exposure were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also criticized the fact that the authors did not compare vaccinated and unvaccinated children to determine whether any aluminium exposure causes harm, even though they had some data on unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other critiques posted on the journal website overlapped with Kennedy’s criticisms, says Anders Hviid, the senior author and an epidemiologist at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark’s public-health agency. Hviid says he and his colleagues addressed the critiques “one by one”. He also published a &lt;a href="https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/data-vs.-doubt-danish-scientist-responds-to-u.s.-hhs-secretary-critique-of-aluminum-vaccine-study-290120e9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/data-vs.-doubt-danish-scientist-responds-to-u.s.-hhs-secretary-critique-of-aluminum-vaccine-study-290120e9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;rebuttal&lt;/a&gt; of Kennedy’s article on TrialSite News on 3 August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
