Once these symptoms started up again, I went for a blood test and they found I had really elevated prolactin. Doctors said it can mean one of two things – either you're breastfeeding – which I wasn't – or you've got another tumour.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After an MRI, Loz was diagnosed with a new tumour on her pituitary gland again, as well as a growth on her pineal gland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The pineal gland regulates wake and sleep cycles, so the growth there was really contributing to my fatigue.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of severe exhaustion, Loz's immune system faltered, leaving her battling a continuous stream of viruses and infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because my sleep was so out of whack with the pineal gland growth, my immune system had become a joke and I seemed to catch one thing after the other.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Loz turned to an integrative medicine doctor she had been working with for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Loz was battling crippling fatigue and weight gain, despite a diligent exercise routine and healthy diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After being diagnosed with a tumour on her pituitary gland, Loz's sleep suffered and she was unable to have conversations early in the morning or late in the afternoon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He said, "Look, the main thing is we have to get you feeling less like s***."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He put me on a supplement called NMN. Within a couple of weeks, I felt absolutely amazing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NMN, or nicotinamide mononucleotide, is a naturally occurring molecule found in all living organisms. It serves as a direct precursor to NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), a critical coenzyme involved in hundreds of metabolic processes. Think of NAD+ as the body's energy currency, fuelling everything from DNA repair to cellular metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientific community has long been aware of the importance of NAD+, but it's the discovery of NMN's role in the process that has ignited recent research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr David Sinclair, Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and co-author of Lifespan: Why We Age – and Why We Don't Have To, found that supplementing with NMN could significantly boost NAD+ levels in mice, effectively reversing age-related blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, says the professor, was a defining moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It wasn't just about restoring vision,' he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It proved that ageing is not a one-way street. We turned back the clock in complex tissues without causing cancer, which lent credence to the "Information Theory of Ageing" – the idea that the body ages due to a loss of youthful information, which can be reinstalled, like software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After using a $2 supplement called NMN given to her by an integrative medicine doctor, Loz's energy levels soared&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, if we learn to reboot this software safely, ageing may be reversible in humans, too.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, how does NMN work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It helps to think about the process as supply and demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As we age, our NAD+ levels naturally decline, leaving cells with less of the fuel they need to function optimally. When NMN is introduced, the body readily converts it into NAD+.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By replenishing NAD+ levels, NMN is believed to support cellular health, potentially slowing some aspects of the ageing process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The implications of this are significant, with ongoing clinical trials exploring its potential benefits in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The explosive popularity of the supplement in recent years has led to a number of different brands hitting the market. Here in Australia, a 120-day supply can cost between $79 and $200, which means you'll pay between 60c and $2 per day. (Over in America, 120-day supplies start at around US$60, or 50c per day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Loz says her sleep evened out soon after taking the supplement NMN and she was able to throw herself into her work as a public speaker and life coach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Before I started taking it, all of my cognition had been compromised by this tumour,' explained Loz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I literally couldn't have a conversation before ten o'clock in the morning or after four o'clock in the afternoon. It felt as if my brain was stuck buffering, like an old dial-up modem.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm a professional speaker, so you can imagine what it was like getting up on stage and not being able to remember your own freaking speech,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was so debilitating professionally as well as personally.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After NMN, however, the brain fog lifted almost immediately for Loz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Suddenly, my sleep evened out. I could remember everything again. I had so much more energy and it even changed my body composition. My training finally made a difference and even my hairdresser exclaimed, "What are you doing? This is amazing!" My hair had actually outgrown its extensions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Buoyed by her results, Loz began exploring whether or not she could also supplement with NAD+ itself. After all, if the NMN helped replenish NAD+ levels, surely supplementing directly with NAD+ would yield even better results?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, as it turns out, is a slightly more complex proposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I learnt NAD+ can't be taken orally as a supplement,' Loz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She's correct. NAD+ is a delicate molecule, and the process of travelling through a human digestive system means it's essentially destroyed before it's able to be converted into a useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A growing body of research suggests taking NAD+ subcutaneously – as an injection under the skin – makes it more bioavailable for your body to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I began cycling NAD+ boosters subcutaneously,' Loz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The improvements, again, were amazing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Loz will continue to cycle on and off the NAD+ while consistently taking her NMN supplements to have the maximum benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With the health issues I've had over the years, I've spent $600,000 over two decades just to stay alive – just to stay on this side of the ground, let alone to be thriving,' Loz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I'd only listened to the mainstream advice, I never would have explored the NAD+ or NMN. Now, I don't take medications for anything, and I feel incredible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Today, after years of escalating attacks, that consensus has irrevocably shattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The rupture has centered around, what else, the Covid vaccines. Yesterday, a British cardiologist allied with US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-and-robert-f-kennedy-junior-to-ban-covid-19-vaccine-within-months/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Daily Beast that the Trump administration would soon pull Covid-19 vaccines off the market. Last week, the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/leading-pediatrics-group-recommends-covid-19-shots-for-young-children-differing-from-cdc-5ed971a6?mod=djemHL_t"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the group would continue to recommend Covid vaccines for kids under the age of 2 — openly defying Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/"&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; this May to end the recommendation for both healthy children and pregnant people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology followed suit, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/ob-gyns-clash-with-rfk-jr-to-back-covid-shots-during-pregnancy?cmpid=BBD082525_prognosis&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_term=250825&amp;amp;utm_campaign=prognosis&amp;amp;embedded-checkout=true"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that it would also continue to advise pregnant people to get a Covid shot. In both cases, some of the country’s leading medical organizations said they wanted to maintain access to protection for the very youngest children, either directly or through vaccinating their mothers, because of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/protecting-infants-and-children-from-covid-19-associated-hospitalization.html"&gt;the evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the population is at a higher risk of serious illness from Covid-19 compared to older children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Kennedy, in response, &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/pediatrics/vaccines/117132?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GBECOygD1fmyU5xIQljpeuRFzwnXDVj9HXevA7-1OZ3RduDJVPYJAsBUX-MnSFw2ZoxRzBkKa_sqK-rIOLJKV87DuxA&amp;amp;_hsmi=377385414&amp;amp;utm_content=377385414&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;ominously warned&lt;/a&gt; the physician groups that their members could lose liability protections from medical malpractice lawsuits if they don’t follow the government’s vaccine guidance. In this new reality in which doctors and federal health officials are at odds over who should get vaccines, shots could be harder to get — and not only Covid shots, but flu vaccines and routine childhood shots, all of which have come under Kennedy’s scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And the divide between the Trump administration and other medical authorities may grow even further soon: A group of New England states is &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/22/metro/vaccine-public-health-massachusetts-pennsylvania-rhode-island-vermont-connecticut-maine-kennedy-trump/?event=event12&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosvitals&amp;amp;stream=top"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; this week to discuss whether to issue its own vaccine guidance. Even as scientists develop exciting new applications of the same mRNA technology that helped successfully produce the Covid vaccines as part of &lt;a href="/future-perfect/2023/1/18/23560407/operation-warp-speed-pandemics-vaccines-covid-white-house-biden-trump"&gt;Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed”&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, Kennedy is canceling mRNA contracts with drug developers. The loss of federal funding for the platform could possibly close off future treatments before they can even be developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As a result of all this, more people could get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Drug manufacturers may produce &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-25/rfk-jr-s-real-impact-on-us-vaccine-supply-to-emerge-as-panel-meets?embedded-checkout=true"&gt;fewer doses&lt;/a&gt; of their existing vaccines. Insurers &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other-health/acip-cdc-and-insurance-coverage-of-vaccines-in-the-united-states/"&gt;may not be willing&lt;/a&gt; to cover people’s shots if they are not being recommended by the government. Various nightmare scenarios could emerge: Maybe a vulnerable person gives up on getting a shot, even if it is recommended for them and covered by their insurance, simply because they can’t &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; one at a nearby pharmacy. Or maybe the healthy loved one of a vulnerable person won’t be able to afford their shot because their insurance plan won’t cover it anymore.

Around the turn of the century, more than 90 percent of Americans &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; that childhood immunizations were important. After years of federal advocacy and government coordination with doctors, the United States had successfully &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;eradicated&lt;/a&gt; measles as of 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But in 2025, less than 70 percent of Americans still &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that childhood vaccinations are “very important.” This year, the US saw &lt;a href="/vaccines/411756/us-measles-outbreak-cases-deaths-charts"&gt;its worst measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; since the early 1990s, and Kennedy’s health department was, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccines-rfk-trump/"&gt;based on reporting&lt;/a&gt; by KFF Health News, reluctant to help, while he made public statements &lt;a href="/health/401130/texas-new-mexico-measles-rfk-hhs-response"&gt;waffling&lt;/a&gt; on the value of vaccines — even though the measles vaccine is 97 percent effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Well, for starters, even though anti-vaccine activism has existed for decades, the movement received a boost with the COVID-19 pandemic and the way &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2790248"&gt;it polarized people’s opinions&lt;/a&gt; about public health experts. It edged further into the mainstream with Kennedy’s presidential campaign promising to “Make America Healthy Again” — a movement that has found &lt;a href="/health/421349/trump-rfk-jr-maha-movement-epa-health"&gt;an uneasy home&lt;/a&gt; within the Trump administration. After Trump’s election, he nominated Kennedy to be US health secretary and, once confirmed, Kennedy quickly started rolling back the federal government’s support for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the first few months on the job, he &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/vaccine-opponent-hired-by-rfk-jr-scours-official-records-for-link-to-autism-a1091eb4?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_goqS6BuIyd4jwcvUhO4YmiNe6Tl5q-I3GZjHxmZ74tTJTxdSWDx4fJQ-0zWbnwrluvqD-3IQ0yq-XRLnjILrSLQWbfA&amp;amp;_hsmi=365387600&amp;amp;utm_content=365387600&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;put a vaccine skeptic in charge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="/health/414740/rfk-jr-autism-kids-causes-diagnosis-meaning"&gt;searching for a link&lt;/a&gt; between vaccines and autism.

He &lt;a href="/health/416304/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-experts-fired"&gt;replaced the federal government’s expert vaccine panel&lt;/a&gt; with his own handpicked members.

            &lt;em&gt;Nearly impossible to measure, quantify, convey, pain is a truly mysterious human sensation. For the last 25 years in my life as a neurosurgeon, I have seen a lot of pain and suffering firsthand, so much of it chronic, persistent and difficult to treat. That is why I spent the past three years digging deep into the complexities of pain, its relationship to the brain and strategies to combat it that you have probably never considered. For most of us, pain will be a reality at some point in our lives, but I am more convinced than ever that “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/It-Doesnt-Have-to-Hurt/Sanjay-Gupta/9781668014479" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Doesn’t Have to Hurt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” which is the title of my new book, releasing on September 2. I am delighted to share a selection below. Then, on September 7, watch CNN at 8 p.m. ET to witness incredible cutting-edge innovations in pain relief in my new documentary, “Dr. Sanjay Gupta Reports: It Doesn’t Have to Hurt.” - Sanjay&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            When headaches or sore muscles strike us at home, we reach for everyday painkillers. Usually it’s something like ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen, all analgesics known in the medical world as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs). The most common non-NSAID pain reliever is acetaminophen, or Tylenol, which isn’t an anti-inflammatory but works well to reduce fever and is typically easier on the stomach. Even before reaching for those over-the-counter meds, we may ice a sore elbow or lower back, or soak in a hot tub to ease achy muscles or joints.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen55ilt00023b6qs67a57zo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the clinical setting, we certainly appreciate it when the dentist numbs our mouth with Novocain. We take anesthesia for granted when rolling into surgery (having had an IV sedative first), or receiving an epidural during childbirth — as my wife did for all three of our girls. Then, of course, there are post-op meds — including, when necessary, prescription opioids to manage acute pain through recovery. In all these ways, we’ve become accustomed to pain relief being an “outside job.” But in truth, elaborate biochemical systems, molecular mechanisms, and mind-body networks for pain control and prevention already exist within us, an “inside job” that science is only beginning to unpack.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen55ilt00033b6q9hyfkewb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mind, body, brain, bones, and blood: every part of us is wired not only for pain but also for pain relief. It’s an incredible system that gets little attention, one I first experienced all those years ago while lying impaled on that spiked fence. Even before I went to the ER or received any medications, I could feel my body starting to soothe itself, my own healing mechanisms taking over. The pain didn’t disappear, but it came in waves, with periods of real relief in between. And then, simply having my mother arrive provided not just mental and emotional comfort but actual physical comfort too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen564j100063b6qmsi8smh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having a caring person in your life can improve your resilience to pain, whereas isolation or loneliness can exacerbate it. I remember the first time one of my children got a shot. I didn’t even have to think about what to do: my first instinct was to comfort her with voice and touch.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen56aif00093b6q5jxwz9ll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes when we’re sidelined with a painful injury, a call from a friend or even just listening to music can make a difference in how we feel by flooding the brain’s pain-processing circuitry with positive feelings and emotions. Training your brain in this way is a crucial piece of the healing mix for pain relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen564j100073b6qqqxkughm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Think of this healing mix as an expanded toolbox that goes beyond what most people consider the “real” tools for pain relief. The conventional conversation tends to focus on medications and medical interventions, but I want to bring your attention to other, less appreciated tools. Let’s start with your body’s built-in painkillers, the endogenous opioid system.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmen57d1h000b3b6qf5148ho5@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="your-bodys-natural-painkillers-endogenous-opioids-placebos-and-more" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Your body’s natural painkillers: Endogenous opioids, placebos, and more
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen55g9e00003b6qafh0k10p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By now you know that opiates are some of the world’s most powerful painkillers. But what you may not know is that your body is adept at producing the natural form of these same chemicals. They’re called endorphins, a term that merges the Greek word &lt;em&gt;endogenous &lt;/em&gt;(meaning “from within”) and &lt;em&gt;morphine&lt;/em&gt;. Though endorphins are just one of several types of protein molecules with this painkiller quality, the word is often used to refer to them collectively. And as you’re about to learn, they can influence your mood as well as your perception of pain. Pump up the endorphins — decrease the pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen581ez000e3b6qpugxgrim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The natural world serves as both an inspiration and a guide as scientists search for ways to tap into or mimic its unique problem-solving genius. A bird in flight, the strength of a spider’s web, a gecko’s sticky grip — all have served as models for scientific inventions. Bioinspired innovations are all around us, from skyscrapers to syringes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000j3b6qq3z6ho15@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many years ago, when drug developers began to search for molecules and mechanisms that could safely reduce pain, they drew inspiration from our own human bodies and their endogenous opioid system. Keep in mind that in addition to reducing pain, the system is involved in emotional regulation and mood, neurogenesis (growth of new neurons in the nervous system), neuroplasticity, learning and memory, and the brain’s reward- processing system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000k3b6q7q0z4j35@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So how does it work? Opioids, whether endogenous or those found in narcotics (called exogenous opioids), bind to opioid receptors located on the outer membrane of nerve cells in the brain, spinal cord, and other organs. Like molecular keys in locks, when opioids bind to these receptors, they trigger a cascade of chemical changes within and between neurons, producing feelings of pleasure as well as pain relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000l3b6qjvw54i94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The receptors are also present in the brain’s reward circuitry, which uses the neurotransmitter dopamine to tag experiences of pleasure. That is why we often want to repeat certain experiences. That’s true of all opioids. But endogenous opioids have an insider advantage as a natural part of the body’s interwoven system for pain modulation. Like software programs that are part of the same operating system, they mesh seamlessly. Evolution has fine-tuned their actions with meticulous precision, including the way the body metabolizes them so they can constantly turn on or off, as well as micromanaging doses. This prevents some of the complications that arise with outside opioid medications, including constipation, brain fog, slowed breathing, nausea, and drug tolerance and dependence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000m3b6qptu1mjkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nature even added an emergency survival tool: stress-induced analgesia that temporarily suppresses pain. Under extreme stress, the fight-or-flight hormones aggressively trigger the endogenous opioid system, which greatly reduces the pain. The pain does eventually come back when this emergency hormonal response subsides, but in the meantime, traumatic injuries may not immediately register as painful to a wounded soldier or a kid impaled by a fence. “When you look at the release of norepinephrine and opioids for the flight and fear response — it is one of the most potent analgesic, anti-pain molecules that exists,” says Daniela Salvemini, Ph.D., William Beaumont Professor and director of St. Louis University Institute for Translational Neuroscience. Having devoted her career to understanding the mechanisms that drive neuropathic pain, and the molecules that may relieve it, she remains in awe of “what our bodies have given us as survival kits.” For some, it kicks in right away, and for others, it takes considerably longer, but everyone appears to have this naturally occurring plan B for the most dire circumstances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen595rt000o3b6q0rgjmtm5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A variety of stressors, not just physical pain, can trigger the endogenous opioid system. These include psychological, neurological, physiological, even ontological (spiritual or metaphysical) factors, which can activate the system to:
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58jlt000h3b6qrhq3938d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because most of these endogenous opioid benefits take place at a subconscious level, these processes have long been assumed to be inaccessible, meaning not something you can control in the same way you can pop a pill. But now we know that simply moving — jogging or going for a brisk walk — can trigger an endorphin release that delivers the rush we call an endorphin high, or “runner’s high.” Gazing at a sunset or a loved one can help do it as well. You can activate your own endogenous opioid system and experience the surprising power of your neural circuits to disrupt pain &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;amplify pleasure. We now know that just by choosing to focus on something beautiful or positive, a wondrous cascade of events unfolds in our bodies that can change our experience of pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmera7y9m00003b6nkkfboyw3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Let’s take a closer look at the term &lt;em&gt;placebo effect&lt;/em&gt;, which many think of as a fake pill or sham treatment used in clinical research to compare effects with the “real” treatment being studied. Researchers typically compare the two, because any health improvements from a new or experimental medication must outperform the placebo by a measurable amount before being deemed worthy of taking forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawzvn00093b6no5mmv7zk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recognizing a placebo’s intrinsic value as something that can improve pain, however, scientists are now investigating the placebo effect on the endogenous opioid system. This makes sense because we know cognitive factors — our thoughts, beliefs, and expectations — can affect our physical and emotional well-being by activating the endogenous opioid system. We also recognize that the effect of any treatment, placebo or “real,” may be affected by the meaning we attach to it, in addition to the physical property of the treatment itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawzvn000a3b6nk25vqtyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two important findings about placebos have become clearer over time. First, there is no single placebo effect; placebo effects are influenced by a multitude of factors at any given time, including expectations (positive or negative) about treatment. Second, these expectations, while intangible, are the product of subjective and physiological experiences that are wired into the brain’s pain-processing circuitry and can be modified over time. This means that far from just being a sham treatment, placebo is a legitimate tool in your pain toolbox.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawy8z00073b6ncs72aba7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now let’s turn to the external tools. Keep in mind that these can change, or how we use them can change, as scientific understanding evolves. Here’s a simple example that involves a routine home remedy so common and widely accepted, you’ll be surprised to learn that it’s been at the center of a simmering debate for nearly fifty years — and counting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000h3b6n1csmi2q4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You’ve probably heard of RICE — rest, ice, compression, and elevation — and may have even used it to treat a sprain, strained muscle, or painful bruise. For as long as I can remember, RICE was the recommended first response for treating acute tissue injury.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000i3b6nsc4etexe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The concept of RICE dates back to 1978, when a sports medicine physician named Gabe Mirkin coined the term, which coaches and health care providers quickly adopted. At the time, conventional wisdom was that reducing inflammation, along with resting, would reduce pain and hasten healing. Slightly elevating an injury to decrease blood flow and applying gentle pressure presented no red flags medically, so the RICE treatment grew in popularity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000j3b6nnl5079qu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whenever I had a mild injury, I used these steps too without ever giving it much thought. Recently, though, amid a flourishing debate, some newer candidates include PEACE (protect, elevate, avoid anti- inflammatories, compress, and educate); LOVE (load, optimism, vascu- larization, and exercise); and POLICE (protection, optimal loading, ice, compression, and elevation). Without going into all the differences — from vascularization (blood vessel formation) to gauging the proper load for an injured muscle — I’d just point out that the expanding conversation reflects that focus on tweaking health and medical approaches as new scientific findings emerge. What I see as most compelling is a loose but well-reasoned growing consensus that suggests the better option is to replace RICE with MEAT, which stands for movement, exercise, analgesia, and treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000k3b6nlszz9p1a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s why. The downside of RICE is that it tamps down inflammation.&lt;br&gt;As you’ve read in previous chapters, some level of inflammation is necessary to activate healing processes and reduce the chance of developing chronic pain. While dialing down inflammation may initially ease pain, it also can delay or inhibit long-term tissue healing. The lesson is a critically important one when it comes to pain: let the body take care of itself as naturally as possible. Given what we now know, unless you have a fractured bone or can’t bear weight, RICE should no longer be the blanket recommendation for pain management.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeraysou000m3b6nxmc9re54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, the emphasis is now on these four steps:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeray2p8000f3b6nd8y1woze@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Movement: &lt;/strong&gt;Mild movement or exercise improves blood flow and circula- tion of healing agents to the injured area. It stimulates muscle, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and other tissue, whereas stagnation can stall healing and lead to continuing pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeraz3bh000p3b6nw1c3m3nh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Exercise: &lt;/strong&gt;This component is meant to kick in once the pain has lessened.&lt;br&gt;For a muscle injury, this would involve gentle moves designed to slowly restore function and flexibility. For other types of bruised or swollen soft tissue, for example, from surgery or trauma, mild exercise further improves circulation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerazj20000s3b6n9d59rzgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Analgesia: &lt;/strong&gt;Cautious use of pain relievers if necessary, as well as the use of natural options such as turmeric or capsaicin instead of anti-inflammatories, which may inhibit healing for the reasons already described. Also consider topical anesthetics and analgesic patches, or mild transcutaneous neurostimulation such as the TENS device, which applies a low-voltage current to the skin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerazxfc000v3b6nvxsazm6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; The final component of MEAT refers to the range of tailored early treatment through various therapeutic approaches. These might include physical therapy, massage, acupuncture or other “dry needling” (solid needles containing no medication), myofascial release (and other techniques using targeted massage to release tension in a specific muscle area), joint mobilization (to improve range of motion), as well as use of ice and heat.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb0cbj000y3b6nvec3e2si@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heat and cold therapy both can help relieve pain, though they work in different ways and are best for different situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb0skl00113b6nh7oswhic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cold therapy is best for short-term pain, applied within the first seventy-two hours to counter swelling. Keep in mind that while cold temperature slows blood flow, which can help reduce pain from sprains, strains, and other acute injuries, it may also decrease inflammation, slow healing, and increase the likelihood of chronic pain. Regular cold-water plunges have gained a popular following in recent years, and some studies suggest that regular cold exposure through ice bathing or plunges may ease discomfort after intense workouts and help with stress regulation. These may not be the best options, however, for treating an injury. The practice continues to be the subject of debate because it may also carry risks for some people — in particular those with cardiovascular issues. The concern is something known as a cold shock response, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Some may also hyperventilate, which can lead to fainting as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1i0f00163b6n0hzkm4dv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heat therapy is best for long-standing muscle pain, stiffness, and chronic pain conditions. Because it boosts blood flow, which can help relax muscles and ease aching joints, heat therapy is often recommended before exercise or stretching or to ease morning stiffness. Applying low-level heat for a longer period, such as with heat wraps you can buy at the drugstore, may reduce stiffness and tension and increase flexibility. Just be sure to follow product directions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1i0f00173b6num9cm5z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Either way, don’t overdo it. When using a hot or cold pack, wrap it in a thin towel to protect your skin and apply it for no more than ten to twenty minutes to avoid skin damage. You can do this several times a day, but be sure to take breaks in between to let your skin and tissue recover. And stop using heat or cold therapy immediately if it worsens your pain or discomfort or if your skin reacts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1i0f00183b6ns8ydt47l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Neither MEAT nor RICE is all wrong or always right. But with a basic understanding of these points of difference, you’re better equipped to eval- uate your options. The bottom line is that a desire for a quick fix may slow your overall healing process; as a general rule, be conservative with initial interventions like these and pay attention to the way your body responds; let the body heal itself and intervene only when necessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Renewed urgency about extended use of aspirin and NSAIDs
&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1gjo00143b6nnv7xgd79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now let’s return to your home medicine cabinet and the nonprescription painkillers you probably keep on hand. If your everyday go-to for pain relief is aspirin or another NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), it’s time to take a fresh look at how you use it. We now have not just new information, but continued findings over time, that have renewed urgency about the serious risks NSAIDs present for some people, as well as the adverse effects of taking too much or taking them for too long.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001i3b6njtzr2xgs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            NSAIDs provide predictable relief for so many routine aches and pains — arthritis flare-ups, headaches, fever, menstrual cramps, colds, flu — that it’s easy to lose track of how often you’re using them and how much you’re taking, and overlook their potential for toxic or other adverse effects. And because these drugs are sold over the counter, it often means you’re making a decision about medication without your physician’s guidance on how to avoid potential problems based on health conditions you may have or medications you may be taking. Keep in mind that these nonprescription medications were mostly intended for short-term use, so relying on them long term might put you at risk for complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001j3b6nbtn85whq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspirin is a good example. For decades, aspirin has been used for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which is heart disease from plaque buildup in the arteries. In light of recent trial data, however, that practice is now controversial. The &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/aspirin-heart-older-adults-recommendations-wellness"&gt;risk of bleeding&lt;/a&gt; might simply be too high to justify the benefits of preventing heart disease in someone who’s otherwise healthy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001k3b6n20nrx3gr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That is why in 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended that people over sixty years old should not take aspirin to pre- vent primary heart disease. Even for those aged forty to forty-nine who may have a lower bleeding risk, the benefit is still thought to be small. If you’ve already had heart problems or have a strong family history and no evidence of bleeding problems, your doctor may recommend a daily baby aspirin. But in general, many doctors have moved away from the practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Supplements: Considerations, caution, and careful use
&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3w38001g3b6nut1f07b9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People are turning increasingly to dietary supplements, seeking out substances they perceive as natural. Unfortunately, because there are very few good, randomized trials, it’s hard to find solid evidence of the benefits of this approach. Additionally, many of these “natural” supplements are unregulated, meaning there’s no guarantee that they’re safe or consistent. There may also be interactions with prescription medications you’re using or other health conditions the supplement could adversely affect. Still, even given the above caveats, I will name a few that are worth considering:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb5l2s001s3b6nu21z5hpa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Coenzyme Q10 or C0Q10. &lt;/strong&gt;There is evidence that this coenzyme can improve mitochondrial function within cells and also act as an anti- inflammatory. Given the way it works, it may be most beneficial when taken after intense activity or with the use of statin drugs — both of which can be associated with muscle aches. It may also effectively lower blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb6shq001x3b6np6gr07mp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Magnesium. &lt;/strong&gt;Evidence exists that this simple mineral, which is found in all our bones, can help with pain, particularly in the lower back. By blocking calcium from entering cells, magnesium may reduce the excitability of your muscles, allowing them to relax and reduce spasm, especially after exercise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Turmeric. &lt;/strong&gt;Growing up in an Indian household, I’ve been eating turmeric since I was a kid. The active ingredient, curcumin, is thought to be a potent anti-inflammatory, particularly effective for osteoarthritis of the knees. Recently it has been recommended to help reduce the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. In recent lab experiments, however, turmeric  inhibited some chemotherapy drugs from working against breast cancer cells and also increased the risk of kidney stones, so make sure to check with your doctor if there is a concern. And buy from a reputable source.&lt;br&gt;Turmeric is among spices that have recently been flagged as potentially being contaminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Willow bark. &lt;/strong&gt;The active ingredient in willow bark is salicin, which is very similar to aspirin. It is broken down into salicylic acid, which helps decrease pain and fever, and like aspirin may have side effects such as upset stomach and bleeding problems. If you’re sensitive to aspirin, have kidney disease, or you’re taking a blood thinner (or planning surgery) check with your doctor.

            As you consider these or any of the many other options for pain relief we’re about to explore, keep this in mind: pain relief isn’t just about physical relief; it is an integral part of a complex, dynamic healing process that involves every other system in your body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbiwuk002d3b6n7dd7wbnh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One reason opiates have proven so destructive, especially when used as ongoing treatment for chronic pain, is that over time they corrupt those natural systems. In exchange for initial pain relief, they slowly disable processes essential for normal functioning and healing, and they can create new complications: constipation, nausea, slowed breathing, dizziness, depression, brain fog, and the obvious — dependence and addiction. All of these compromise healing and health, often prolong pain, and carry even greater health risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbiv4s002b3b6nsprv5629@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We’ve seen remarkable progress in pain management since the days when opioids and steroids were used to treat most pain maladies. For neuropathic pain, that shooting or burning sensation, we now have drugs such as gabapentin, a prescription medication originally developed as an anticonvulsant, which regulates how pain messages travel from the brain through the spinal cord and reduces the excitability of nerve cells in the brain. “Gaba” (sold under the brand names Horizint, Grayliese, and Neurontin) was approved for treatment of neuropathic pain about twenty years ago, but it is far from a perfect drug. A 2017 review concluded that while around half of those treated had objective pain relief, they also often experienced adverse effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, tiredness, headache, nausea and vomiting, memory loss, weight gain, coordination problems, and eye problems. The drug worked best for postherpetic neuralgia; evidence for other types of neuropathic pain was very limited.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbkht8002k3b6n6io6yxwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We’ve also seen an uptick of interest in the use of antidepressants for pain, especially for chronic migraines and long-standing arthritic pain. It’s not entirely clear yet why they help relieve pain for some people. The fact that they increase serotonin, which can improve mood, might be one reason. It may also be that they affect the &lt;em&gt;perception &lt;/em&gt;of pain, reducing the focus the person puts on it and thereby distracting them from it. What is clear is that these medications take a long time to work, sometimes up to several weeks, and even then, the patient may need regular dosage adjustments to minimize side effects. A 2021 systematic meta-review of thirty-three trials showed that serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) reduced back pain with moderate certainty, osteoarthritis pain with low certainty, and sciatica with very low certainty on pain and disability scores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbkht8002l3b6n0bqp7idc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2023 Cochrane network meta-analysis examining antidepressants across all chronic pain conditions concluded that after investigating twenty- five different antidepressants, “the only antidepressant we are certain about for the treatment of chronic pain is duloxetine. Duloxetine was moderately efficacious across all outcomes at standard dose.” There is also promising evidence for milnacipran, the study said, but higher-quality research is needed. “Evidence for all other antidepressants was low certainty.” Additionally, after randomized controlled trials excluded people with low mood, the review was unable to establish any beneficial effects of antidepressants for people with chronic pain. The review concluded that currently there is “no reliable evidence for the long-term efficacy of any anti-depressant.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbl6ig002n3b6n3ju627oc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In people who suffer chronic pain, there’s emerging evidence that their sensory neurons are more excitable than usual and can therefore be more easily triggered. For that reason, there’s new interest in the use of sodium channel blockers, an established tool for quieting seizures, which are also caused by overexcited nerve cells in the brain. Novocaine, which dentists inject into the tissue they want to numb for a procedure, is one example of a sodium channel blocker. The goal has been to turn that into a pill that works for chronic pain conditions, and researchers are currently making progress on that front.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbl6ig002o3b6nrtlrej9g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just this year, the FDA approved the first &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/30/health/fda-approves-painkiller-suzetrigine-journavx"&gt;new drug&lt;/a&gt; in a new class of non-opioid pain medicines, approved to treat moderate to severe acute pain in adults. The approval of Journavx (suzetrigine) marked the first approval of a new class of non-opioid pain relievers in more than two decades. While opioids primarily work by dulling sensations in the brain, the new drug, in fifty milligram oral tablets, is reported to reduce pain by targeting a pain-signaling pathway involving a specific sodium channel in the peripheral nervous system, before the pain signals reach the brain.&lt;br&gt;The efficacy of Journavx was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of acute surgical pain, one following abdominoplasty and the other following bunionectomy. In addition to receiving the randomized treatment, all participants in the trials with inadequate pain control were permitted to use ibuprofen as needed as a “rescue” pain medication. Both trials demonstrated a statistically significant superior reduction in pain with Journavx compared to placebo, the FDA said in announcing the approval.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The discovery of this drug has a fascinating backstory. Nearly twenty-five years ago, researchers learned about a family of fire walkers in Pakistan. They could walk on hot coals without flinching. Importantly, they felt the coals on their feet and even knew they were hot, but it was the specific sensation of pain they weren’t feeling. It wasn’t that their feet were numb, given that the nerves responsible for heat and touch seemed unaffected. Rather it was just the pain-conducting nerves that were affected. That observation led to a quarter-century investigation, the identification of a gene unique to this family, and ultimately helped inspire the development of the new medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul data-editable="items" class="factbox__items factbox__items--ul"&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.0.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prescription pain medicines&lt;/strong&gt;, including opioids﻿. These provide stronger pain relief than nonprescriptive options, but because they have potential for abuse and unpleasant and potentially serious side effects, they should be reserved for more severe types of pain.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prescription drugs approved for other conditions&lt;/strong&gt; but repurposed “off-label” for pain. These include antidepressants and anticonvulsants.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuromodulation&lt;/strong&gt;, including spinal cord stimulation (SCS), an implanted device that sends low levels of electricity directly into the spinal cord to relieve pain; deep brain stimulation (DBS); and local (external) electrical stimulation, applying brief pulses of electricity to nerve endings under the skin to provide pain relief (Scrambler, TENS).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.3.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Injection therapies&lt;/strong&gt;, including: &lt;strong&gt;Epidural steroid injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Nerve blocks&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Joint injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Trigger point injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Dry needling&lt;/strong&gt;: Usually as part of a larger pain management plan, dry needling is sometimes recommended. The treatment, which can be initially painful, involves placing thin sharp needles through the skin and into what are known as “trigger points,” areas of muscle that have become knotted and tender. The needling can decrease tightness, improve blood flow, and reduce pain. It’s called “dry” because there are no medications in the needle, as with trigger point injections. &lt;strong&gt;Botox&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Gel injections&lt;/strong&gt; (hyaluronic acid to mimic cushioning fluid in joints): often used for knee pain, especially mild to moderate arthritis. &lt;strong&gt;Prolotherapy injections&lt;/strong&gt; (concentrated sugar water to relieve pain in joints, ligaments, and tendons); &lt;strong&gt;Regenerative medicine&lt;/strong&gt; (orthobiologics): a newer category including injectables made from your own blood or tissue, or application of dressings using biomaterials (such as placenta), used to restore tissue in skin grafts and other wound or surgical sites. &lt;strong&gt;Platelet-rich plasma injections and cell therapy&lt;/strong&gt;: PRP injections involve taking the patient’s blood, isolating and concentrating the platelets, and injecting billions of them into the joint, ligament, or tendon. Some newer injectables, called cell therapies, collect cells and tissues from bone marrow or fat tissue. The cells are collected, cleansed, and injected into the patient’s joint, ligament, or tendon.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Others&lt;/strong&gt;﻿, including: &lt;strong&gt;Nitrous oxide&lt;/strong&gt; (laughing gas); &lt;strong&gt;Radiofrequency ablation&lt;/strong&gt;, which treats spine pain by using radio waves to heat and destroy nerve tissue, preventing the associated pain signals from reaching the brain. There’s also pulsed electromagnetic wave therapy, a noninvasive FDA-approved treatment that uses magnetic field pulses to improve blood flow to a localized area of pain, such as that from rheumatoid arthritis. &lt;strong&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation&lt;/strong&gt; (TMS) is performed by placing a coil on the head to send magnetic pulses that can change the brain’s activity in areas associated with pain. A recent trial showed that the treatment, typically daily sessions for four to six weeks, results in about half of fibromyalgia patients experiencing a meaningful reduction in pain. &lt;strong&gt;Extracorporeal shock wave therapy&lt;/strong&gt;: Think of it as using high-energy sound waves through the skin right on top of the painful area. This type of therapy seems to trigger the body’s natural healing mechanisms, break down scar tissue, and stimulate the formation of new blood vessels.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.5.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;. This can effectively relieve some kinds of pain, primarily that caused by structural issues. Most pain is not caused by structural issues, however, and in those cases, an operation not only won’t resolve the pain, it may even make things worse.&lt;/li&gt;

L.A. County also has reported a small increase in patients hospitalized with COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of COVID out there,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at UC San Francisco. “COVID is coming a little bit later than last year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which COVID lab tests came back positive in &lt;a class="link" href="https://ph.lacounty.gov/acd/respwatch/" target="_blank"&gt;L.A. County&lt;/a&gt; is 12.6% for the week that ended Aug. 16, up from 7.6% a month earlier. In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/respiratoryvirus" target="_blank"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt;, it’s 14.4%, up from 8.1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing outpatient cases increase,” said Dr. Elizabeth E. Hudson, the regional physician chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente Southern California. “With back-to-school season in full swing ... we are expecting to see an uptick in COVID in children over the next few weeks and this is already being seen in some parts of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class="link" href="https://yourlocalepidemiologistca.substack.com/p/covid-surge-an-emerging-disease-protecting" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; post, Dr. Matt Willis, former public health officer for Marin County, wrote that “California’s in the middle of a COVID-19 wave, and statewide rates are among the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank"&gt;highest&lt;/a&gt; in the nation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among senior-age residents in Orange County, emergency room visits for COVID-like illness, as well as hospitalizations for COVID, are also on the upswing, said Dr. Christopher Zimmerman, a physician with the Orange County Health Care Agency’s Communicable Disease and Control Division, and Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the county’s health officer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudson said the coronavirus subvariant XFG, nicknamed Stratus, accounts for the vast majority of variants seen in wastewater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is another Omicron subvariant, so previous infections with other Omicron variants may offer some residual protection, but, as we know, that protection is not complete, so you can certainly be reinfected,” Hudson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does seem that this summer, COVID season has been less intense than last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In L.A. County, for instance, current COVID hospitalizations for the week that ended Aug. 16 are about half the level seen during the same week last year. And in Orange County, emergency room visits related to COVID-like illness are less than half what they were last summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last summer’s COVID surge was the largest since 2022, so this year’s surge is more on par with our less-severe summer surges,” Hudson said. “People are definitely getting COVID this summer, but the intensity is much less than in 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise in COVID comes as the Trump administration has delayed the rollout of the updated vaccine for the fall. Last year, the federal government had fully green-lighted the annual reformulation of the vaccine by &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s-t0627-vaccine-recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;June&lt;/a&gt;, in time for a rollout that began in September. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, however, the Department of Health and Human Services led by vaccine skeptic Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has in effect delayed the rollout of this fall’s COVID shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Updated COVID-19 vaccines have been delayed this year due to federal policy changes, and we are awaiting [Food and Drug Administration] licensure of this season’s products,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in a statement to The Times. “This means availability in September may be later than what people experienced last fall.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;County health officials noted that the FDA could further revise or limit who can get an annual COVID shot — as &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-05-20/trump-officials-set-new-requirements-for-covid-vaccines-in-healthy-adults-and-children"&gt;the agency signaled in May&lt;/a&gt; — “though current evidence continues to show that the vaccines are safe and effective across all ages.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health also warned that because the federal government hasn’t made decisions on licensure approvals and recommendations, “availability and timing of specific COVID-19 vaccine products may be more limited and occur on a later schedule.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in an unfortunate limbo, created by an administration that’s uncommitted to vaccines, between the slow shutting down of ’24–’25 vaccine availability and access to the ’25–’26 version,” Willis wrote in the Your Local Epidemiologist in California &lt;a class="link" href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-171508787" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said that the timing of the vaccine rollout is in such flux and he recommends anyone at risk for severe complications from COVID who hasn’t been vaccinated in more than a year to get inoculated now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at severe risk for COVID illness include those 65 and older, those who have compromised immune systems, those who are pregnant, and all infants and children age 6 months to 23 months. (Children age 2 to 5 are also at greater risk for complications from COVID compared with older children.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they haven’t gotten it in a year, just go ahead, maybe, get it now,” Chin-Hong said. “Because also, the vaccine that’s being proposed [for this fall] is relatively the same formula as last year. ... It’s less important to wait.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might also be easier to get the COVID-19 vaccine now ahead of potential changes in federal recommendations and approvals later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong called the delay in formulating a COVID vaccine game plan for this fall “just weird,” as “usually in public health, preparation is everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point in previous summers, health officials typically already would be urging people to make plans to get a fall COVID vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this time around, “Nobody knows details about who’s going to be eligible, exactly,” Chin-Hong said, except for those age 65 and up and younger people with chronic health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a whole new discussion, like, ‘When is it coming? Who is it going to be eligible for? ... Do kids have to talk to their pediatrician first? Would pharmacists actually allow them to get it? ... Would healthy pregnant people [be able] to get it?” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s as if officials are talking about a new vaccine and a new illness, but the COVID-19 vaccine has been around for more than four years, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the federal government’s treatment of COVID shots is not happening in a vacuum. Kennedy has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-08-12/rfk-jr-s-cancellation-of-mrna-vaccine-research"&gt;maligned mRNA vaccine&lt;/a&gt; technology — the basis for the most commonly administered COVID shots — and ordered the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-16/dismissed-members-of-cdc-vaccine-committee-call-kennedys-actions-destabilizing"&gt;firing&lt;/a&gt; of all 17 experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s influential vaccine advisory committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person who will lead a committee to review the safety of COVID vaccines for the CDC has described the shots as “the most failing medical product in the history of medical products,” the New York Times &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccines-rfk.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccinations &lt;a class="link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2836434" target="_blank"&gt;averted&lt;/a&gt; 2.5 million deaths globally from 2020 to 2024, according to a report published in the journal JAMA Health Forum in July. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine-skeptic leadership of Kennedy over the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA and CDC, has prompted such a split in the medical community that mainstream organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics are issuing their own recommendations concerning vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC, for instance, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-05-31/cdc-radically-changes-its-covid-vaccine-recommendations-heres-what-you-need-to-know"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; asked that parents talk with a healthcare provider before getting the COVID vaccine for healthy children. That’s an extra step parents may need to take to get their children vaccinated, and could end up being a “super big barrier” for vaccination, Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the CDC recommended everyone 6 months and older get an updated COVID vaccine in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also recently offered “no guidance” as to whether healthy pregnant women should get the COVID vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, by contrast, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; that people “receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine or ‘booster’ at any point during pregnancy, when planning to become pregnant, in the postpartum period, or when lactating.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The COVID-19 vaccines are particularly effective at reducing morbidity from COVID-19 complications in pregnant patients and their infants,” the organization said. “Data also support the benefit of vaccination in reducing pregnancy complications, such as severe maternal morbidity, preterm birth, and stillbirth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the American Academy of Pediatrics on &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073924/203222/Recommendations-for-COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants" target="_blank"&gt;Aug. 19&lt;/a&gt; recommended that infants and children age 6 months to 23 months get the updated COVID vaccine, since they “are at high risk.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also said that children ages 2 and older should be offered the latest COVID vaccine if their parent or guardian wishes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The COVID vaccine situation is unsettling. ... Differences in guidance from the CDC and other medical professional groups will be challenging for the public,” the Orange County communicable disease control team said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNRGpRQkNuRm9Ed01oc2VqR3RubUVTSFZ1WXpwWXVGWEE0SGVLZy1ZY1ltLUpBZzUwVnhOcmItS09DajNPbG5zcU1MNkVZekEtVEtyVGNzVGlzXzE4ZVNsclNoTHFVUlliM01PS2MzTURIUkJNb0dqeml4LUZDdjVpTW15MG8xWERZeFBoODlrV1dSSDltMlJrdGEwNE42TW5TY1NORUxtSzI2NHlLUVFyVFBhaGhBb2ZYbnloSlFNZXhMUDdEeXFTUQ</guid></item><item><title>康普茶对你有好处吗？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/well/eat/health-benefits-kombucha.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 09:00:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFA0VUM4QnNVTUxpWVpHbDdDRWV3V0l0cXVIOVduZUlpM3l6S1JiblppR2VyQmFsNXhVNnI1cC11SHVZUXg2T2lkRVBCNmpIdXhCU2lMQV91aE1ZaXUtOXpGZWxrVDVIblA5eXRIY2F2MEk1ZTFpeXdQSnBsVWJ1QQ</guid></item><item><title>挑战150多年的免疫疗法：科学家推出在没有免疫系统的情况下杀死癌症的新武器- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/challenging-over-150-years-of-immunotherapy-scientists-unveil-new-weapon-that-kills-cancer-without-the-immune-system/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two bacteria working in harmony show powerful antitumor effects. The approach could transform treatment for immunocompromised patients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Professor Eijiro Miyako at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), working in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. and the University of Tsukuba, has created a pioneering bacterial therapy for cancer that operates independently of the immune system. This new approach relies on a specially designed microbial consortium called AUN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of bacterial cancer therapy dates back to 1868, when German physician Busch reported that intentionally infecting a patient with bacteria led to tumor regression. Later, in 1893, Dr. William Coley proposed bacterial injections as a treatment, laying the foundation for cancer immunotherapy. Over the past 150 years, these early ideas evolved into advanced treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cells. While effective for some, these therapies all depend on immune cell activity, which limits their effectiveness in patients whose immune systems are weakened by chemotherapy or radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490803" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490803" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490803" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo-777x700.jpg" alt="Schematic Illustration of A Gyo and UN Gyo" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo-777x700.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo-400x360.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo-768x692.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo-150x135.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo-450x405.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Schematic-Illustration-of-A-Gyo-and-UN-Gyo.jpg 909w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490803" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Schematic illustration of A-gyo and UN-gyo. Credit: Eijiro Miyako from JAIST&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new AUN therapy overcomes this challenge by combining two naturally occurring bacterial strains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proteus mirabilis (A-gyo), a microbe that thrives within tumors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhodopseudomonas palustris (UN-gyo), a photosynthetic bacterium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mechanisms of tumor eradication&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in close cooperation, the “AUN” bacterial pair achieved remarkable tumor clearance in both mouse and human cancer models, even under immunocompromised conditions—all without relying on immune cells. The therapy demonstrated strong biocompatibility and very limited side effects, notably preventing cytokine release syndrome (CRS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490802" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490802" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Graphs-and-Histology-Showing-AUN-Efficacy-and-Safety.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490802" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Graphs-and-Histology-Showing-AUN-Efficacy-and-Safety-777x750.jpg" alt="Graphs and Histology Showing AUN Efficacy and Safety" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Graphs-and-Histology-Showing-AUN-Efficacy-and-Safety-777x750.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Graphs-and-Histology-Showing-AUN-Efficacy-and-Safety-400x386.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Graphs-and-Histology-Showing-AUN-Efficacy-and-Safety-768x741.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Graphs-and-Histology-Showing-AUN-Efficacy-and-Safety-150x145.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Graphs-and-Histology-Showing-AUN-Efficacy-and-Safety-450x434.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Graphs-and-Histology-Showing-AUN-Efficacy-and-Safety.jpg 798w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490802" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of AUN (representative data shown). Credit: Eijiro Miyako from JAIST&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, AUN’s potent antitumor activity was driven by several coordinated bacterial mechanisms, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Harmony between bacterial partners&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, UN-gyo functions as a regulatory partner only when coexisting with A-gyo, helping to suppress the pathogenicity of both strains while simultaneously enhancing their tumor-specific cytotoxicity. This “cooperation of labor” mirrors the Japanese philosophical concept of “AUN”—perfect harmony between opposites. It is this delicate and dynamic interplay between the two bacterial &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;species&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;A species is a group of living organisms that share a set of common characteristics and are able to breed and produce fertile offspring. The concept of a species is important in biology as it is used to classify and organize the diversity of life. There are different ways to define a species, but the most widely accepted one is the biological species concept, which defines a species as a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce viable offspring in nature. This definition is widely used in evolutionary biology and ecology to identify and classify living organisms.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;species&lt;/span&gt; that unlocks the remarkable antitumor efficacy—a feat previously unattainable through conventional therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To accelerate the social implementation of this research, we are preparing to launch a startup and aim to begin clinical trials within six years,” said Professor Eijiro Miyako, lead author of the study.&lt;br&gt;
“A new chapter in bacteria-based cancer therapy—pursued for over 150 years—is finally beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revolutionary approach represents a paradigm shift for immunocompromised cancer patients. It offers a long-awaited therapeutic solution in cases where conventional immunotherapies fail—ushering in the dawn of truly immune-independent cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

But a new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is raising awareness of ways to lower that risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2746dd" class="body-graf"&gt;The study points to five risk factors that public health officials — and, in some cases, women themselves — can do something about: obesity, diabetes, smoking exposure, food insecurity and low levels of folate (an essential vitamin that helps the body produce cells).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f3b48" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the study, 66% of women ages 12 to 49 have at least one of these risk factors, and 10% have three or more. The CDC’s findings, &lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00438-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, are based on responses from 5,374 women who completed the agency’s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59ba56" class="body-graf"&gt;“We can’t underscore enough how important it is to raise awareness about these risk factors and encourage women to speak with their doctors if they have any concerns or questions before becoming pregnant,” Arick Wang, a health scientist at the CDC and the lead author of the new study, said via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-39d619" class="body-graf"&gt;She added that the “risks can be lowered through steps like getting the recommended 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily, healthy diet and exercise, and managing blood sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2769f9" class="body-graf"&gt;Birth defects are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-infant-health/infant-mortality/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;leading cause of death in infants&lt;/a&gt;, according to CDC data. The risks often start before some women even know they’re pregnant. Though the causes of birth defects are largely a mystery, scientists generally recognize that some combination of genetics, environment and lifestyle factors is responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-160a62" class="body-graf"&gt;“This should be a wake up call to all of us,” said Dr. Michael Warren, chief medical and health officer of March of Dimes, a nonprofit research and advocacy group focused on maternal and infant health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d34eb2" class="body-graf"&gt;“We want to make sure that people have access to nutritious foods,” said Warren, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We want to make sure that people have safe places to be physically active.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe2186" class="body-graf"&gt;People with food insecurity can be deficient in nutrients that are vital for a fetus’ organs to develop properly, including folate. For instance, low concentrations of folate in the blood are associated with neural tube defects — brain or spine defects that develop in the first month of pregnancy. Doctors recommend that people who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant take folic acid, the synthetic version of folate.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d50f31" class="body-graf"&gt;Since 1998, the Food and Drug Administration has required that enriched cereal-grain products be fortified with folic acid. Wang, the CDC scientist, said in a press release that the policy likely prevents more than 1,300 babies each year from being born without neural tube defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4353b2" class="body-graf"&gt;“The vast majority of birth defects that occur, we still don’t know why they occur,” Nembhard said. “Even when women do everything right — they don’t smoke, they don’t drink during pregnancy, they monitor caffeine intake, they exercise — you can still have an outcome that is not what you wanted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1f3cdb" class="body-graf"&gt;Warren, who until June served as associate administrator of HHS’ Maternal and Child Health Bureau, said many women might not be aware that conditions like obesity and food insecurity are also risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c841b" class="body-graf"&gt;Obesity, which affected roughly one-third of the women surveyed, was the most common modifiable risk factor in the CDC study. Scientists aren’t exactly clear on why it’s linked to birth defects, but they suspect it has something to do with changes to a woman’s metabolism — such as the way her body manages insulin and glucose — that may lead to abnormal development in the fetus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90f59a" class="body-graf"&gt;“When [our] cells are growing and forming organs, we really rely on everything to be working just as it should. And when you disrupt those processes, things can go awry,” Warren said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f0317b" class="body-graf"&gt;High blood sugar from diabetes may also lead to abnormal organ development, he said. And some of the chemicals in cigarette smoke, including nicotine, can reduce the supply of oxygen to the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8a0cc2" class="body-graf"&gt;Warren said there’s more to be done. He pointed to Mississippi, which &lt;a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/page/23,30305,341.html" target="_blank"&gt;declared a public health emergency&lt;/a&gt; last week over its high infant mortality rates and pledged to eliminate “care deserts,” where women don’t have access to obstetricians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-df275c" class="body-graf"&gt;Outside researchers lauded the study’s release amid layoffs and proposed funding cuts to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-976572" class="body-graf"&gt;“We’re delighted that this study has been ongoing.

&lt;p&gt;According to scientists at the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease in the southern Chinese city of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/china-several-dead-after-ship-hits-bridge-in-guangzhou/a-68334582"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, the pig lung, which was transplanted into a brain-dead human recipient, "maintained viability and functionality" for 216 hours (nine days) without becoming infected or being rejected by its host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c44391" data-lang-code="en" data-id="68339716" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is xenotransplantation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transplantation of organs across species is known as &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/could-pigs-hearts-soon-beat-in-human-bodies/a-46615611"&gt;xenotransplantation&lt;/a&gt; and has been touted as a potential solution to the global organ shortage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03861-x" title="External link — Guangzhou study"&gt;Guangzhou study&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, advancements have recently been made in heart and kidney xenotransplantation from pigs to humans, but lungs present "distinct challenges" due to their "anatomical and physiological complexity."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other things, the direct contact of the lung with the outside air naturally increases the risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the genetically altered lung transplanted from the 22-month-old, 70-kilogram, male, Chinese Bama Xiang pig to the 39-year-old male human patient survived and functioned for over a week of monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This study demonstrates that genetically modified pig lungs can maintain viability and functionality in brain-dead recipients for 216 hours without signs of hyperacute rejection or evidence of uncontrolled infection," concluded the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This success highlights the progress made in genetic modifications and immunosuppressive strategies but also underscores key challenges that must be addressed for clinical translation."&lt;/p&gt;

Another type – Salmonella Dublin – is primarily associated with cattle and can cause more severe illness in people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors see more bloodstream infections, longer hospital stays, and a higher risk of severe outcomes when this &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10803612/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dangerous bacteria&lt;/a&gt; infects people, which it has started doing recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does it get there? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-raw-milk-health-hazard-pasteurization-important/"&gt;Unpasteurized milk&lt;/a&gt; and undercooked beef are common routes, and contact with sick animals can spread it too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not only a farm issue; it is a public health issue because what happens around cattle does not always stay around cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-humans-cattle-and-salmonella-dublin"&gt;Humans, cattle, and Salmonella Dublin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have wrestled with a practical question: Are the Salmonella Dublin strains in cattle, people, and farm-linked environments in the United States different or basically the same? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer shapes how we prevent infections and how we handle antibiotics. If the strains match closely across settings, the effective approach should connect animal health, human health, and environmental monitoring – an idea many researchers call “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;One Health&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This catchy phrase isn’t just a slogan. If the same bug moves between species and spaces without changing much, targeting only one part of the supply chain system will not be enough. We need solutions that address the pathogen wherever it travels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-salmonella-dublin"&gt;Studying Salmonella Dublin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers gathered Salmonella Dublin from three places: sick cattle, sick people, and environmental sites tied to farms or processing facilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they sequenced the bacteria’s DNA to compare how closely the strains were related. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In genetics, scientists track tiny letter-level changes called single nucleotide polymorphisms (&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/genomicresearch/snp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SNPs&lt;/a&gt;), pronounced “snips.” Fewer SNP differences mean the strains likely share a recent common ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal was to see whether strains from cows, people, and the environment clustered into separate groups or stayed together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they stayed together, that would point to active movement between hosts and places, not isolated pockets of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-know-so-far"&gt;What we know so far&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team learned that strains from cattle, humans, and the environment in the U.S. were extremely similar – often differing by only a small number of SNPs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;Applied and Environmental Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers reported that despite some genetic differences across 2,150 Salmonella Dublin strains, the bacteria remained highly similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This similarity shows potential for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/reverse-zoonoses-humans-are-getting-their-pets-sick/"&gt;cross-transmission&lt;/a&gt; between cattle, humans, and the environment,” explained team leader and senior author Erika Ganda, an associate professor of food animal microbiomes in the Penn State &lt;a href="https://agsci.psu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;College of Agricultural Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s important, because it shows that Salmonella Dublin is highly connected across humans, animals and the environment – so efforts to control it need to consider all three,” Ganda continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study’s findings provide detailed genetic evidence that can help guide surveillance – tracking the bacteria, intervention strategies such as limiting &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/antibiotic-resistance-increasing-enterococci-looming-global-crisis/"&gt;antibiotic use&lt;/a&gt; in livestock and public health policies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-salmonella-dublin-has-a-tight-family-tree"&gt;Salmonella Dublin has a tight family tree&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic picture does not split into distant branches based on where or when strains were found. It looks like a “tight family tree.” That suggests ongoing movement between animals, people, and farm environments or equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of connected pattern matters for hospital readiness, farm policies, and everyday choices at the dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also examined &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/climate-change-increases-threat-antimicrobial-resistance/"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt;. They did not stop at asking whether resistance existed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They checked which resistance genes appeared and how those patterns differed among strains from cows, people, and the environment. They found meaningful differences across those sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means control strategies should match the resistance patterns in each place. A one-size-fits-all antibiotic plan is unlikely to work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responsible antibiotic use requires laboratory testing and clear guidelines, not guesswork, to protect drugs that still work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-farms-families-and-food-chains"&gt;Farms, families, and food chains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevention starts before anyone gets sick. On farms, that includes biosecurity to keep new or sick animals from spreading infection, plus cleaning and disinfection that reach tough spots. In the food chain, the basics work: &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/most-americans-dont-know-the-dangers-of-raw-milk-and-bird-flu/"&gt;pasteurize milk&lt;/a&gt; and cook beef thoroughly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For home kitchens, avoid raw milk and use a thermometer. Ground beef should reach 160°F, and whole cuts like steaks should reach 145°F with a rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clinics and hospitals, rapid laboratory testing helps clinicians avoid antibiotics that will not work. When lab teams can see the resistance profile early, patients get better treatment sooner, and we save the stronger drugs for when they are truly needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-high-resolution-genome-map"&gt;High-resolution genome map&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome sequencing turns thousands of bacterial samples into a high-resolution “map.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing SNP differences across many strains, scientists can connect dots that older methods might miss, including hidden links between farm sources and human cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means public health teams can focus on the pathways doing most of the harm. Targeted steps beat broad, blunt strategies, especially when resources and time are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-salmonella-dublin-and-human-health"&gt;Salmonella Dublin and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a fear story or some type of political stunt. It’s a highly-coordinated scientific study driven by peer-reviewed evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Salmonella Dublin population looks tightly knit and changes only a little as it spreads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That clarity helps, because it points to a shared job and a big “to-do” list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials must strengthen surveillance that connects animal, human, and environmental samples; tailor antibiotic guidelines to the resistance patterns seen in each source; and block obvious transmission routes with pasteurization, thorough cooking, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-confirm-first-case-of-rare-parasite-in-pigs-posing-health-risks/"&gt;farm hygiene&lt;/a&gt;, and smart infection control in clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, the same pathogen keeps appearing in cows, people, and nearby environments, showing a nearly identical genetic profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a shared target and coordinated defenses, we stand a better chance of stopping it before it reaches pandemic levels by starting on someone’s dinner plate, ending up in the bloodstream, and spreading from there like wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.00689-25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applied and Environmental Microbiology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 01:52:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQNEJSSlBKcWcxa3ZHZ0MwR29zVmNQWkw3SnZhRTgtdGtpaC1GRVFOLTR4OUVJMXpDTjRoSGpqSFpPMmtobXNuU2FjR0pLU0ZRTFFKV3ZpeEVvOHE5YTgwNThsSnNHbG91elB4NWNvSUV4cUlMZV9UaUl6THI0QVJYSmk1Rm1paVIxM3kzbC11VmRJejVpcnNfUlNrV2RsaVo3T3B1ZDF3MGpPNnM</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法， 50岁以上的女性应该吃5种抗炎食物- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-foods-for-women-over-50-11794640</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Berries, beans, greens, salmon and nuts can help reduce inflammation and protect health after 50.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These foods provide antioxidants, fiber, protein and minerals to support brain, bone and muscle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy aging also requires movement, quality sleep, social connection and regular health checkups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you hit 50, you might be among the women either in the midst of or approaching menopause. This phase of life may bring digestive issues, hot flashes, weaker bones and muscles, and chronic inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s also a time where taking care of your brain and body are all the more important so you can age healthily. Fortunately, some nutrition changes can help reduce inflammation and manage other health issues that may arise in midlife. Dietitians recommend eating plenty of berries, beans, leafy greens, nuts and fatty fish to boost your intake of antioxidants, fiber, calcium, healthy fats and protein. Learn more about the top five foods you should eat if you’re 50 or older.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-berries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Berries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, raspberries—all are rich in antioxidants that help reduce inflammation and support healthy aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “I love recommending these because they’re easy to add on to foods that you might already be eating, like your morning yogurt or your midday snack plate,” says &lt;a href="https://www.loveyourchichos.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Zariel Grullón, RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.re a key part of the MIND diet—an eating pattern designed to help prevent dementia and other forms of cognitive decline. Given that 2 out of 3 Americans experience cognitive decline by age 70, eating foods that support brain health is valuable for healthy aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berries are a key part of the MIND diet—an eating pattern designed to help prevent dementia and other forms of cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Given that 2 out of 3 Americans experience cognitive decline by age 70, eating foods that support brain health is valuable for healthy aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-beans"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Beans &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans contain compounds called peptides, polyphenols and saponins that have anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Getting a mix of beans makes sure you’re feeling fuller longer and also helps to fight off excess inflammation in the body,” says Grullón.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s more, beans are full of fiber to support a healthy gut microbiome, which may help manage menopause-related gut issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You’ll get about half of your daily fiber needs in just 1 cup of black beans!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They also provide valuable plant protein that can help prevent age-related muscle loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beans are great because, similar to the berries, we can add them as a side to any meal, whether it’s refried or stewed beans in the morning, or a dense bean salad to supplement your lunches,” says Grullón. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-dark-leafy-greens"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Dark Leafy Greens &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, watercress and bok choy are loaded with beneficial nutrients and phytochemicals that [quash] inflammation and help reduce oxidative stress,” says &lt;a href="https://seemashahrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Seema Shah, M.P.H., M.S., RD, IFNCP, WIMI-CP&lt;/a&gt;. This includes vitamins A, C, E and K, as well as powerful polyphenols.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Several dark leafy greens also contain plant chemicals like sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol, which inhibit several pro-inflammatory pathways in the body,” says Shah. Like most other foods on this list, they’re also a source of fiber, “which helps with immune modulation, blood sugar management and the lowering of inflammatory processes,” says Shah. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During menopause, drops in estrogen can wreak havoc on bone health, so it’s even more important to eat enough calcium when you’re in this phase of life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Dark leafy greens are especially rich in bone-building minerals like calcium, magnesium and potassium,” says Shah.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you only think of dark leafy greens as a salad base, consider broadening your horizons. “When you’re tired of making salad, but are still trying to increase greens, consider a plant-based smoothie that balances the fruit with dark leafy greens,” recommends &lt;a href="https://ladybugnutrition.com/#" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jamie Baham, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-salmon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Salmon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Salmon is worth adding to your diet since it’s chock-full of omega-3s—fatty acids well-known for their anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Including one to two servings of fatty fish per week can support heart health, reduce stiffness associated with arthritis and help preserve brain function. For women in this age group, it’s also a great source of high-quality protein and vitamin D—two nutrients that support muscle mass and bone strength,” says &lt;a href="https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/elizabeth-oconnor" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lizzie O’Connor, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are lots of tasty ways to add this inflammation-fighting food to your diet. “One of my favorite ways to incorporate fatty fish into my weekly regimen is making homemade poke bowls with salmon, brown rice, avocado, cucumber and a drizzle of soy sauce. It’s a delicious sushi-in-a-bowl delight that has been a repeat in my home,” says Baham.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Nuts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A handful of nuts offers a number of antioxidants and heart-healthy nutrients—such as phytosterols, selenium, magnesium, tocopherols, polyphenols, unsaturated fats and fiber. Nuts make for a convenient snack whether you’re at home or on the go. Thanks to their robust nutrition profile, nuts can help lower your risk of cardiovascular disease. Almonds and walnuts appear to be especially helpful for lowering inflammation, while Brazil nuts help reduce oxidative stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Particularly if you don’t eat fish, walnuts are worth adding to your diet for their inflammation-fighting omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

For the most benefits, incorporate a mix of cardio, strength training, balancing and stretching into your workout routine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socialize:&lt;/strong&gt; Loneliness and social isolation can increase your risk of chronic disease and early death. So, make an effort to maintain or develop quality relationships as you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize your sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Studies show that good-quality sleep is linked with lower rates of disease and disability, and better physical and mental functioning with age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So look at sleep as an essential part of your wellness routine!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get regular health checkups:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t underestimate the importance of keeping up with your health care visits and vaccinations. It can help prevent illness, catch health issues early and/or manage existing health issues proactively.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As you approach midlife and beyond, making a few dietary changes can help ward off chronic disease and inflammation. Foods like berries, beans, leafy greens, salmon and nuts can be especially beneficial. By adding these foods throughout your day, you’ll boost your intake of antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, fiber and healthy fats. You’ll also get key nutrients for brain, muscle and bone health to support healthy aging. In addition to adding more of these foods, don’t underestimate the power of physical activity, sleep and socialization! These, along with getting regular health checkups, are also central to aging well.&lt;br&gt;

The trial, called VITAL, tracked more than 1,000 adults over four years and has just been published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the Harvard study found&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study tested 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D3 daily—about three times the recommended amount, but still within the safe upper limit of 4,000 IU. Participants taking the supplement showed significantly less DNA damage compared to those who received a placebo. Researchers measured telomeres—protective caps on chromosomes that shorten with age and are strongly linked to longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“VITAL is the first large-scale and long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres and preserve telomere length,” said Dr. JoAnn Manson, Chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. She added, “This is of particular interest because VITAL had also shown benefits of vitamin D in reducing inflammation and lowering risks of selected chronic diseases of aging, such as advanced cancer and autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the findings, participants on vitamin D lost far less telomere length than the placebo group, preventing the equivalent of nearly three years of aging. First study author Dr. Haidong Zhu, a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, said: “Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use vitamin D safely&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the promising results, experts caution against overuse. Most adults are advised to take 600–800 IU daily, while supplements commonly come in doses of 1,000–2,000 IU. Taking more than 4,000 IU per day can be harmful, leading to a dangerous buildup of calcium in the blood. This condition, called hypercalcemia, can cause nausea, vomiting, constipation, kidney stones, and even organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Harvard researchers stress that while vitamin D shows great potential, the trial was relatively short and lacked diversity, as most participants were white. Longer-term and more inclusive studies are needed before the supplement can be recommended as an anti-aging strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was partly funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>华盛顿县2名学龄儿童麻疹检测呈阳性- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51365558/2-school-aged-children-in-washington-county-test-positive-for-measles</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ST. GEORGE — Two school-aged children in Washington County have tested positive for measles, according to the Southwest Utah Public Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children's schools have been notified of potential exposure — school started on Aug. 11 in Washington County — as have parents of students who attend the schools, a statement from the health department says. All unvaccinated children and adults who believe they have been exposed to the disease are also encouraged to stay home for 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents of immunocompromised children are advised to consider keeping those youngsters home for 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southwest Utah health officials said measles symptoms typically start seven to 14 days after exposure, which was on Aug. 21 in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include "a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, and a rash that starts on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. While most people recover at home, some people — especially children — can experience complications of breathing problems, pneumonia, brain swelling, seizures, hospitalization, and even death," reads the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents, school employees, children and anyone else exposed to measles are encouraged to call their health care provider before going to be evaluated at a medical facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Residents should make sure that they and their children are caught up on vaccinations as soon as possible," the health department said..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:26:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNNlAyTmtONU5xMmFocHg2VXlGUEJ2U3UyVVc0R3NHT012cHllanpfaFlWVnVma3UtT3JfMFYwMDM0RklETHJYQnpDcFI2cDJvMGNHQURVemd1Vk9YZ2JJVFRwa3gxcnJHWnk2NVcwMmRIb210UUxsLWpoZ182Vjk1Y2hhNi1GLVFYUldTZng4Q2pkbklha1VWeDBORmt5Z09XTDhtTklDUzZDdw</guid></item><item><title>强迫症患者的大脑活动中出现了一种独特的模式- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/a-distinct-pattern-emerges-in-the-brain-activity-of-people-with-ocd</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder"&gt;Obsessive–compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt; (OCD) negatively impacts the lives of millions of people worldwide, but more effective treatments could be on the way after researchers were able to identify specific neural biomarkers associated with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These biomarkers are patterns of brain activity present in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ocd-is-a-serious-illness-and-its-more-common-than-you-think"&gt;people with OCD&lt;/a&gt; when they're acting compulsively, and which don't show up the rest of the time. While it's difficult to know exactly what these firing neurons are doing, their patterns could help understand the condition – and figure out how to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, the researchers looked at data from electrodes implanted in the brains of 11 people with chronic OCD, seeing how their brain activity changed over time in reaction to compulsive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/us-woman-receives-revolutionary-brain-implant-for-ocd-and-epilepsy"&gt;US Woman Receives Revolutionary Brain Implant For OCD And Epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have found a clear biological marker for OCD in the brain, a marker that we may be able to use in future treatments for OCD," &lt;a href="https://nin.nl/news/neural-biomarkers-discovered-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Tara Arbab of the University of Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patterns were put into four stages: baseline (sitting quietly), &lt;a href="https://www.ocduk.org/ocd/obsessions/"&gt;obsession&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ocduk.org/ocd/compulsions/"&gt;compulsion&lt;/a&gt;, and relief (post-compulsion). An obsession might be avoiding dirty surfaces, for example, with the compulsion being washing hands; these were tailored for each person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171260" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WaveChart.jpg" alt="Brain waves chart" class="wp-image-171260 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WaveChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WaveChart-600x359.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171260" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers measured brain waves during different phases. (Arbab et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain waves of two specific frequencies, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_wave"&gt;alpha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_wave"&gt;delta&lt;/a&gt;, were noticeably prominent during compulsive acts. These electrical signals surged across all brain regions, and were observed for both mental and physical compulsions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In psychiatry, it is almost never possible to link a symptom so directly to brain activity," &lt;a href="https://nin.nl/news/neural-biomarkers-discovered-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Arbab. "This study shows that it is possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were able to measure deep brain activity with very high spatial and temporal precision. That's not possible with an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"&gt;fMRI&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"&gt;EEG&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study participants had all received various forms of treatment for their OCD, without success. The implants used as brain monitors here had already been implanted prior to the study so that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation"&gt;deep brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt; (DBS) could be tried as a therapy approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many different parts to OCD that it's difficult to be certain about how it works: scientists have also looked at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/record-study-connects-hundreds-of-genetic-markers-with-ocd"&gt;genetic influences&lt;/a&gt; and links &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ocds-origins-might-not-lie-in-the-brain-like-we-thought"&gt;to gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; for clues about how the condition starts and how it persists. The severity of OCD can vary quite significantly from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As OCD treatments go, DBS isn't often used, and is still in an experimental stage. The idea is to control brain signaling to some extent, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v11.i9.659"&gt;it can work well&lt;/a&gt; – but questions remain about long-term effectiveness and potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new information gathered in this study, the DBS approach could perhaps be made more targeted and effective. Further down the line, it might even be possible to artificially manipulate brain waves &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-brain-signals-associated-with-ocd-for-the-first-time"&gt;during compulsive episodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's still some way off, but we do now know more about how OCD changes activity in the brain: where these changes happen, and how long they last for. These 'neural signatures' for the disorder are being slowly built up, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-neural-signature-of-ocd-has-been-identified-in-the-human-brain"&gt;piece by piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been doing [DBS] in animal models for years, but in patients, this technology is still new," &lt;a href="https://nin.nl/news/neural-biomarkers-discovered-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Arbab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00457-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have trouble pooping in the morning, eating dinner at the right time might help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GI experts say eating dinner three hours before bed may help you go in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It gives your body time for digestion and works with your body’s natural rhythms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For most people, a morning poop can feel like the perfect start to the day. Your body feels lighter, your mind is at ease, and you’re ready to move on without worrying about when nature will call. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to set yourself up for that smooth morning bathroom trip, &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you eat dinner matters almost as much as what’s on your plate. Digestive-health experts say that finishing your last meal about three hours before bedtime can give your digestive system the time it needs to do its job. This early-evening eating window takes advantage of your gut’s natural rhythms, prevents &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-after-5-pm-to-poop-the-next-morning-11774654" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sluggish digestion overnight&lt;/a&gt; and can help you stay regular without relying on more stimulating methods like coffee or laxatives. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, pooping in the morning is not essential. But it does come with some advantages. “Mornings are convenient because your body is naturally primed to eliminate after waking and eating, and it can set a nice one-and-done rhythm before the day gets busy,” says gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelbassmd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Michael Bass, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you could use some help getting things going in the morning, here’s how eating dinner three hours before bed can give your gut the kick start it needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-3-hours-before-bed-is-the-best-time-to-eat-dinner"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why 3 Hours Before Bed Is the Best Time to Eat Dinner &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Gives Your Body Enough Time for Digestion &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your digestive system is most active during the day, and it naturally slows down in the evening.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “If you finish dinner at least two to three hours before bed, you give your body time to digest enough so that, by morning, the colon is ready to move things along,” explains Bass. Wrapping up dinner about three hours before bed allows your gut to focus on processing your meal while you’re awake instead of trying to multitask while you sleep. That digestive break can lead to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-in-the-morning-to-help-you-poop-11718405" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoother, more predictable bowel movement&lt;/a&gt; the next morning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Helps Train Your Gut &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our guts love routine almost as much as our brains do. Eating around the same time each night helps train your digestive system to follow a regular pattern. “The body thrives on rhythm and patterns more so than isolated events, so focusing on &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; sleep and wake times, meal patterns, movement and adequate hydration is most important,” points out &lt;a href="https://www.staceycollinsnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stacey Collins, M.A., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Stacey Collins Nutrition, a gastrointestinal-focused registered dietitian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When your body gets used to receiving food at consistent times, it tends to respond in kind, often with a morning bathroom visit right on schedule.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Syncs with Circadian &amp;amp; Digestive Rhythms &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just like your sleep-wake cycle, digestion runs on an internal 24-hour clock known as your circadian rhythm. “The body is usually primed for a morning bowel movement due to cortisol shifts with the body’s natural circadian rhythm,” says Collins.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By eating earlier in the evening, you’re aligning your mealtime with your body’s natural digestive peak. That sync-up can mean &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-in-the-morning-to-prevent-bloating-throughout-the-day-11782328" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;less bloating at night&lt;/a&gt; and a better shot at a timely trip to the bathroom after breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Timing is essential, but these evening habits can also set you up for success the next morning. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrate Well. &lt;/strong&gt;Water helps keep stool soft and easy to pass, and your colon can’t do its job without it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, don’t skimp on fluids when you eat dinner. Herbal tea, water or even a broth-based soup all count. Just keep in mind that gulping large amounts of liquid right before bed might have you up for reasons other than a morning bathroom trip. And don’t neglect your water first thing in the morning, either. “A big glass of water right after waking can kick-start your gut,” says Bass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Up on Fiber. &lt;/strong&gt;Fiber adds bulk to stool and helps it move through your digestive tract more efficiently. At dinner, aim for a mix of soluble fiber and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber, found in foods like beans, lentils, oats, nuts, apples, pears, oranges and strawberries, helps soften stool. Insoluble fiber, in whole grains and many veggies, bulks things up to keep them moving along.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take It Easy on Sodium. &lt;/strong&gt;Research has found that people with high sodium intake are more prone to constipation. Conversely, people who eat more low-sodium whole foods like fruits, vegetables and lean protein (especially plant protein and seafood) tend to be more regular.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move a Little After Dinner. &lt;/strong&gt;A brisk walk after your evening meal can gently stimulate digestion and keep things moving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, it’s a great way to wind down without heading straight for the couch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try Magnesium Before Bed. &lt;/strong&gt;“Nighttime magnesium could help stimulate a morning bowel movement,” says Collins. That’s because magnesium pulls water into your gut, lubricating your stool so it’s easier to pass.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Bonus: Some people feel magnesium helps promote sleep. While more studies are needed to confirm this association, a nighttime magnesium supplement could be an added plus if it also helps you poop in the a.m.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skip the Late-Night Snack. &lt;/strong&gt; “Late-night snacks can muddy the waters a bit,” says Bass. “If you’re grazing right up until bedtime, that can blunt the ‘overnight reset’ and make your morning bowel reflex less predictable.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating dinner about three hours before you hit the hay is a smart way to work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; your body’s natural rhythms to help you poop in the morning. This interval gives your body enough time to digest your dinner, creates a predictable pattern for your digestive system and syncs with your body’s circadian rhythm. Like most health-related habits, consistency is key, says Collins. So, try to stick with this timing as often as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For your best shot at regular morning bowel movements, pair this habit with plenty of water, fiber-rich, low-sodium whole foods, magnesium supplements and an after-dinner stroll. As helpful as these strategies may be, it can be good to know there’s no such thing as the perfect time to go to the bathroom. “Don’t stress if you skip a morning or two,” says Bass. “Regular means what’s normal for your body, not the same time every day.”&lt;br&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a drink most people enjoy every day. But consuming it while taking common antibiotics may raise the risk of being sickened by deadly bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from three countries evaluated nearly 100 chemical substances and how they interacted with &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/e-coli/index.html" id="mol-1bf3f850-81b6-11f0-9cfc-a5f058e671f2"&gt;E. coli&lt;/a&gt;, a type of bacteria that can cause &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14772061/safety-warning-popular-healthy-food-deadly-bacteria.html"&gt;diarrhea, cramps and vomiting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that coffee - or, more specifically, caffeine caused E. coli to absorb a lower level of common antibiotics like ciprofloxacin (Cipro), which is prescribed to treat everything from urinary tract to skin and respiratory infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This makes the antibiotics less effective in treating infections caused by E. coli bacteria, known as antibiotic resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, antibiotic resistance makes bacterial infections impossible to treat, increasing the risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The effects of caffeine were specific to E. coli, which sickens more than 250,000 Americans every year. Caffeine did not weaken antibiotic treatments for similar bacteria like salmonella.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as about two-thirds of Americans report drinking coffee, one of the most prevalent sources of caffeine, every day along with tea and energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common source of E. Coli is undercooked ground beef, where bacteria can spread during processing. Leafy greens like romaine and spinach are another major culprit, along with raw milk and other unpasteurized dairy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Caffeine in drinks like coffee may lower the effectiveness of common antibiotics, a new study has suggested (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;E. coli bacteria can cause infections leading to bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most people recover within a week, but some people can become severely ill and develop a dangerous kidney condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 265,000 Americans are sickened by E. coli every year and over 3,000 are hospitalized. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report about 61 deaths from the bacteria each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published last month in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003260#sec009"&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 94 different chemical substances and their effects on E. coli and salmonella. The substances ranged from antibiotics to prescription drugs to everyday chemicals like caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers evaluated the effect on transporter genes, which control what enters and leaves cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found caffeine activates the protein Rob, which stops as much Cipro from entering cells, rendering it less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ana Rita Brochado, study author and biological engineer at the University of Tübingen in Germany, said: 'Caffeine triggers a cascade of events starting with the gene regulator Rob and culminating in the change of several transport proteins in E. coli – which in turn leads to a reduced uptake of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team noted because the experiments were carried out with cell samples, it's unclear if the same results would be true in human studies. However, they plan to conduct further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study found caffeine affected the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cipro), which is filled about 4million times a year in the US (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also unclear how much caffeine exactly would weaken antibiotics like Cipro against E. coli and if there are specific differences between caffeine sources like coffee and tea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers estimate that 4million prescriptions for Cipro are filled every year, making it one of the most common antibiotics in drugs like amoxicillin and doxycycline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Based on these findings, we foresee a challenging, but unavoidable and important task in mapping key determinants of transport functions across different bacteria.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A new study from Baylor College of Medicine reveals a surprising player: the brain. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists found that metformin acts in the brain through Rap1 to control blood sugar. This insight could lead to more precise diabetes treatments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metformin has been the standard treatment for type 2 diabetes for more than six decades, yet scientists still do not fully understand how it works. A team from Baylor College of Medicine, working with international collaborators, has now identified an unexpected factor in its effectiveness: the brain. Their findings reveal a brain pathway involved in metformin’s glucose-lowering action, pointing to new strategies for treating diabetes with greater precision. The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Science Advances&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;em&amp;amp;gt;Science Advances&amp;amp;lt;/em&amp;amp;gt; is an open-access, peer-reviewed journal published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). It covers a broad range of disciplines including biology, physics, social sciences, and engineering. The journal emphasizes impactful, interdisciplinary research with wide relevance.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been widely accepted that metformin lowers blood glucose primarily by reducing glucose output in the liver. Other studies have found that it acts through the gut,” explained Dr. Makoto Fukuda, associate professor of pediatrics – nutrition at Baylor and the study’s corresponding author. “We looked into the brain as it is widely recognized as a key regulator of whole-body glucose metabolism. We investigated whether and how the brain contributes to the anti-diabetic effects of metformin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers concentrated on a small protein called Rap1, located in a region of the brain known as the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). They discovered that metformin’s ability to lower blood sugar at clinically relevant doses depends on suppressing Rap1 activity in this brain area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rap1 protein and experimental evidence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this further, the Fukuda lab and collaborators studied genetically engineered mice that lacked Rap1 in their ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). These mice were placed on a high-fat diet to simulate type 2 diabetes. When treated with low doses of metformin, their blood sugar levels did not decrease. In contrast, other diabetes drugs, including &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;insulin&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, crucial for regulating blood glucose levels. It helps cells in the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream and convert it into energy or store it for future use. Insulin production and action are essential for maintaining stable blood sugar levels. In people with diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or cannot effectively use the insulin it does produce (Type 2 diabetes), leading to elevated levels of glucose in the blood. This can cause various health complications over time, including heart disease, kidney damage, and nerve dysfunction. Insulin therapy, where insulin is administered through injections or an insulin pump, is a common treatment for managing diabetes, particularly Type 1. The discovery of insulin in 1921 by Frederick Banting and Charles Best was a landmark in medical science, transforming diabetes from a fatal disease to a manageable condition.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;insulin&lt;/span&gt; and GLP-1 agonists, remained effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To strengthen the evidence that the brain plays a central role, the researchers administered extremely small amounts of metformin directly into the brains of diabetic mice. This approach produced a marked reduction in blood sugar, even when the doses were thousands of times lower than those typically given orally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Neuronal activation in the hypothalamus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We also investigated which cells in the VMH were involved in mediating metformin’s effects,” Fukuda said. “We found that SF1 neurons are activated when metformin is introduced into the brain, suggesting they’re directly involved in the drug’s action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using brain slices, the scientists recorded the electrical activity of these neurons. Metformin made most of them more active, but only if Rap1 was present. In mice lacking Rap1 in these neurons, metformin had no effect, showing that Rap1 is essential for metformin to “switch on” these brain cells and lower blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This discovery changes how we think about metformin,” Fukuda said. “It’s not just working in the liver or the gut, it’s also acting in the brain. We found that while the liver and intestines need high concentrations of the drug to respond, the brain reacts to much lower levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although few anti-diabetic drugs act on the brain, this study shows that widely used metformin has been doing so all along. “These findings open the door to developing new diabetes treatments that directly target this pathway in the brain,” Fukuda said. “In addition, metformin is known for other health benefits, such as slowing brain aging. We plan to investigate whether this same brain Rap1 signaling is responsible for other well-documented effects of the drug on the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut microbes produce D-lactate that worsens metabolism. A trap for it restores healthier blood sugar and liver function.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of Canadian researchers has identified an unexpected way to lower blood sugar and protect the liver: by capturing a little-known fuel produced by gut bacteria before it enters the body and causes harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, could open the door to new therapies to treat metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Microbial molecule disrupts metabolism&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from McMaster University, Université Laval, and the University of Ottawa discovered that a molecule generated by gut microbes can cross into the bloodstream, where it drives the liver to overproduce glucose and fat. By designing a method to trap this molecule in the gut before it reaches circulation, they achieved striking improvements in blood sugar regulation and fatty liver disease in obese mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a new twist on a classic metabolic pathway,” says Jonathan Schertzer, senior and corresponding author and professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster. “We’ve known for nearly a century that muscles and the liver exchange lactate and glucose — a process called the Cori cycle. What we’ve discovered is a new branch of that cycle, where gut bacteria are also part of the conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1947, Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Theresa Cori were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing how muscle-generated lactate fuels the liver to make blood glucose, which then cycles back to power muscle activity. Their work established the foundation for understanding how muscles use one form of lactate (L-lactate) and how the liver uses blood glucose in a tightly coordinated fuel exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian team has now shown that obese mice — and even humans with obesity — carry elevated levels of a different molecule, D-lactate, in their blood. Unlike the well-studied L-lactate produced by muscles, D-lactate largely originates from gut bacteria and was found to raise blood sugar and liver fat more strongly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blocking D-lactate with a substrate trap&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stop this, the researchers created a “gut substrate trap” — a safe, biodegradable polymer that binds to D-lactate in the gut and prevents it from being absorbed. Mice fed this trap had lower blood glucose, less &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;insulin&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, crucial for regulating blood glucose levels.

&lt;p&gt;“This is a completely new way to think about treating metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. Instead of targeting hormones or the liver directly, we’re intercepting a microbial fuel source before it can do harm,” says Schertzer, a member of the Centre for Metabolism, Obesity, and Diabetes Research (MODR) and Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute at McMaster. Schertzer holds a Canada Research Chair in Metabolic Inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

that has been helping people stay consistent without &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;burning out&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="recommendations-block-6" data-position="6"&gt;&lt;span class="h2"&gt;BP Daily - Your Source for Balanced News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 6-6-6 method makes walking feel more structured, and it actually burns fat efficiently&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="tiktok-viral-walking-routine-burns-fat-without-workouts-68acb3863d1e2-png__700" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/tiktok-viral-walking-routine-burns-fat-without-workouts/?image_id=tiktok-viral-walking-routine-burns-fat-without-workouts-68acb3863d1e2-png__700.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="This Viral \'6-6-6\' Walking Trend Promises Fat Loss Results Without Burnout" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/tiktok-viral-walking-routine-burns-fat-without-workouts/?media_id=tiktok-viral-walking-routine-burns-fat-without-workouts-68acb3863d1e2-png__700" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tiktok-viral-walking-routine-burns-fat-without-workouts-68acb3863d1e2-png__700.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tiktok-viral-walking-routine-burns-fat-without-workouts-68acb3863d1e2-png__700.jpg" alt="This Viral '6-6-6' Walking Trend Promises Fat Loss Results Without Burnout" title="This Viral '6-6-6' Walking Trend Promises Fat Loss Results Without Burnout" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://stock.adobe.com/ph/images/happy-athletic-woman-taking-a-walk-through-autumn-park/546736795?prev_url=detail" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Drazen/Adobe Stock (Not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-tablet-ad-within-content post-ads"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt;&lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 6-6-6 walking routine consists of three simple stages: a six-minute warm-up, a 60-minute brisk walk, and a six-minute cooldown, according to a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/tiktok-viral-walking-routine-burns-fat-without-grueling-workouts" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fox News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Despite the uniform appearance of pink flamingo flocks, individuals live very different lifestyles. In the Camargue region of France, some stay put for their entire lives while others migrate along the Mediterranean coast. Now, scientists believe these two groups differ in how they age, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research published Monday, August 25, in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2422882122"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt; found that migratory flamingoes, who leave the Camargue annually to spend the winter in Italy, Spain, or North Africa, age slower than non-migratory resident flamingoes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings point to a link between migratory behavior and the rate of aging, adding a new layer of complexity to one of the most central—and perplexing—questions in biology: why do living creatures feature an expiration date? And why do these expiration dates vary so widely among different species? New research adds yet another layer of complexity to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Understanding the causes of changes in the rate of aging is a problem that has obsessed researchers and polymath philosophers since ancient times,” co-author Hugo Cayuela, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1095609"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;. “For a long time, we thought that these variations occurred mainly between species. But recently, our perception of the problem has changed,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Same species, different lifestyle—and lifespan&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mounting evidence suggests that individuals within the same species often do not age at the same rate due to genetic, behavioral, or environmental variation, according to Cayuela. Studying these differences can help scientists unlock the secrets of aging. Thanks to their long lifespans and behavioral diversity, the Camargue’s greater flamingoes provide an ideal model for this research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cayuela and his colleagues analyzed more than 40 years of data gathered by the Tour du Valat research institute’s flamingo tagging and tracking program. These data described mortality and reproductive patterns among 1,840 migrating and non-migrating greater flamingos across the Mediterranean basin. Resident individuals exhibited lower mortality rates in early adulthood than migrating individuals, resulting in life expectancies that were 6.7 years longer on average.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Migratory greater flamingoes, however, exhibited 40% slower aging and reduced mortality later in life than residents. In fact, the findings suggest that aging begins a year and a half earlier in resident greater flamingoes than migrants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also uncovered differences in reproductive patterns between migratory and nonmigratory greater flamingoes. While residents had higher probabilities of breeding than migrants before the onset of aging, they exhibited much steeper declines in breeding with age compared to migrants.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“While residents can reproduce more often early in life, this comes at a cost: higher mortality and reduced reproductive success later on,” co-author &lt;span tabindex="-1" role="gridcell" translate="no"&gt;Jocelyn Champagnon, a research scientist at Tour du Valat, told Gizmodo in an email. “&lt;/span&gt;Migrants, on the other hand, may trade off some early reproduction for better survival later in life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Behavior shapes biology&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These differences are “probably linked to a compromise between performance when young and health in old age,” co-author Sébastien Roques, a postdoctoral researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research, said in the release. “Residents live intensely at first, but pay for this pace later on. Migrants, on the other hand, seem to age more slowly.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest that migrating comes with some disadvantages early in life but reduces the rate of aging and reproductive senescence—the age-related decline in an individual’s ability to reproduce—later in life. According to the researchers, this study highlights the critical role that migration plays in shaping survival and reproduction throughout life, underscoring the importance of behavioral decisions in the biology of aging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that the shape and pace of aging can be shaped by individual decisions early in life, such as migration or early reproduction,” &lt;span tabindex="-1" role="gridcell" translate="no"&gt;Champagnon said. Though these results can’t be directly applied to people, s&lt;/span&gt;he hopes future studies will address questions about how human migrations influence the rate of aging.&lt;/p&gt;

Chan School of Public Health and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. It was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03891-5" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“One reason we wanted to study the Mediterranean diet is because it is the only dietary pattern that has been causally linked to cognitive benefits in a randomized trial,” study first author &lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/147408" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Yuxi Liu,&lt;/a&gt; a research fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham health care system, and a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard and Broad, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We wanted to see whether this benefit might be different in people with varying genetic backgrounds, and to examine the role of blood metabolites, the small molecules that reflect how the body processes food and carries out normal functions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The release said Alzheimer’s has “a strong genetic component, with heritability estimated at up to 80%.” One gene in particular is implicated: apolipoprotein E (APOE) has the strongest genetic risk for the more common type of Alzheimer’s that developed later in life and is not directly inherited in a predictable pattern, per the researchers. It has four variants and people inherit one from each of their parents. Those with one copy of the APOE4 gene variant have three to four times greater change of developing Alzheimer’s. The risk is 12-fold for those with two APOE4 copies, compared to those without that variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-Mediterranean-diet" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The Mediterranean diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Mediterranean diet is largely plant-based, with lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans and legumes. Extra virgin olive oil is the main fat source. The diet can contain fish, poultry and dairy — especially fish that contain a lot of omega-3 fatty acids. Red meat and sweets are discouraged, as is butter, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. The clinic’s webpage includes a Mediterranean food list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Mediterranean diet is also deemed a healthy choice for those looking to reduce their risk of coronary artery disease or other forms of heart disease. The diet has also been linked to maintaining a healthy body weight, improving the gut biome, lowering risk of certain cancers and other health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="About-the-study" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;About the study&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers looked at data from 4,215 women in the Nurses’ Health Study, average age 57 at baseline, following their data from 1989 to 2023. They also looked at similar data from 1,490 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, using data from 1993-2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;To figure out dietary patterns, they looked at food frequency questionnaires and blood samples for a broad range of metabolites. They also considered genetic risk. Participants were followed over time to see if they developed dementia and a subset of 1,037 women underwent regular telephone-based cognitive testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The release said that those following a Mediterranean-style diet had lower risk of dementia and also slower cognitive decline. The protective effect was strongest in the high-risk group with two copies of the APOE4 variant, “suggesting that diet may help offset genetic risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers note that people may not know their APOE status or whether they have the APOE4 allele, adding “more work is needed to translate these findings into routine medical practice.” Liu said they hope to explore whether using diet or other interventions to target specific metabolites could create a more focused, personalized approach to reducing dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Among limitations, they note the study conducted in well-educated individuals of European descent, which might impact whether it can be generalized to the public at large. And dementia outcomes were “based on self-reported physician diagnoses and death records, which may introduce misclassification.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 20:43:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOSnZlRlVjSXhJOGcyRXBQU2Jyc05xQWRYcnYteDRjTGRLVGRLTklRVUFYZXZ3azVrX0JIakRQV0l3cFI3WGVQejBZVlAtb0VLTWFkNUwtcVI3UklBVEJGV0dhOXZiMUZHWElpM1daT2VPQ3FUeHh3RE1icFVGQmszdmJqM3d5OThWS0tVQ1VWQ0NIMG5TNV9Ib013UUtFUmdlRHkw</guid></item><item><title>关于肌酸的知识以及为什么军方为特种部队调节肌酸- Military.com</title><link>https://www.military.com/military-fitness/what-know-about-creatine-and-why-military-regulates-it-special-forces</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
    

    






                            &lt;p&gt;Creatine monohydrate is among the most popular and widely researched dietary supplements globally. Athletes and fitness enthusiasts, among others, use it as they seek to enhance physical performance and muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its reputation is built on decades of scientific research and practical results, making it a common addition to sports nutrition routines and even daily health regimens for older adults.&lt;a href="https://www.military.com/military-fitness/health/creatine-and-military-training"&gt; I have seen mixed results&lt;/a&gt; when athletes undergoing rigorous &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/special-operations"&gt;special operations&lt;/a&gt;-level training take creatine. These athletes typically are still competing in high school or collegiate sports programs but attend a Special Warfare exposure weekend or screening, such as what the &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/base-guide/us-naval-academy"&gt;U.S. Naval Academy&lt;/a&gt; does each semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-68acf98c4ab3b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-68acf98c4ab3d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In military training like Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training (BUD/S),&lt;a href="https://www.military.com/military-fitness/health/protein-supplementation-do-you-need-it"&gt; all supplements are banned for those enrolled.&lt;/a&gt; This is largely a result of dosing and hydration needs not being fully misunderstood and cases of misuse in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Next&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/military-fitness/essential-swim-workout-military-special-operations-candidates"&gt;The Essential Swim Workout for Military Special Operations Candidates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw many special ops recruits who were collegiate athletes struggle with severe cramps and digestive issues. This was my first exposure to the supplement, and the performance of users was not impressive. Shortly afterward, the military banned all supplements from special ops selection programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-68acf98c4acb6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="content-adblock-68acf98c4acb8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, creatine has made a comeback with science-backed studies showing benefits over a wide range of ages. While it remains banned from high-intensity military training programs -- and should continue to be, in my opinion -- the benefits of regular training doses have shown remarkable results for high-performing athletes and the aging population, outside of just adding bulk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved short-term memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced mental and cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Longer attention spans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science has opened my eyes to the use of creatine for many different reasons, not just larger biceps. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Is Creatine Monohydrate?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a naturally occurring compound that can be synthesized in the body. The average adult requires 3 to 5 grams of creatine a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get creatine from dietary sources such as red meat, poultry and fish. If you are a meat eater, you can naturally increase your daily creatine intake by eating 12 ounces of steak, chicken and certain fish, which contain 2 grams, 1.5 grams and up to 5 grams of creatine, respectively. Herring contains 5 grams of creatine per 12 ounces, and salmon is comparable in calories to steak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, cooking meat to a well-done temperature decreases the amount of creatine consumed. If you’re a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7246861/"&gt;vegetarian&lt;/a&gt;, you may want to supplement that, but your body can still synthesize creatine (1 gram daily) with plant-based protein. Discuss with a nutritionist or health-care provider about the proper dosage, especially if you are an athlete or highly active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many things to consider when deciding to take supplements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do they agree with your digestive system?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the appropriate dosage?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it a safe and reputable company that develops and distributes supplements?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Side Effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of creatine can include weight gain, nausea or diarrhea, and it is not recommended for people with kidney disease, liver disease or diabetes. Severe cramping may also occur, likely ending an athlete's training day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recommended Dose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A daily dose of 3 to 5 grams of creatine monohydrate is effective for most individuals. This can be taken at any time of day, with or without food. Power and strength athletes may take much larger dosages (10 to 20 grams), leading to greater effects on performance and how the body handles it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hydration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drink plenty of water throughout the day to support healthy hydration and reduce the risk of cramping or discomfort. Depending on your creatine dosage, gender and size, you may need to consume 3 to 4 liters per day, which is roughly a gallon of water. If you are sweating profusely, you’ll need more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Third-Party Verification for Supplement Safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you choose to supplement, purchase any products from independently tested companies from organizations that test for impurities, such as the&lt;a href="https://www.nsf.org/knowledge-library/who-is-nsf-international"&gt; National Sanitation Foundation (NSF)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://usp.jobs/about/"&gt;United States Pharmacopeia (USP)&lt;/a&gt; or the&lt;a href="https://www.consumerlab.com/"&gt; Consumer Lab.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thorne is another option to consider. Thorne is a trusted brand for Olympic athletes because of its NSF-certified products. In 2016, Thorne became the first nutritional supplement company to be endorsed by the U.S. Olympic Committee for supplying U.S. national teams. However, athletes must select from Thorne's specific "Certified for Sport" line, as not all Thorne products are tested to this strict standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Research and Benefits That Deserve Consideration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine has always been linked to improved&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11828245/"&gt; muscle growth, strength growth and power performance enhancements.&lt;/a&gt; With resistance training, sprinting and explosive movements, creatine can increase the body's capacity to perform these short full-effort activities. These benefits have been observed in trained athletes and recreational exercisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental performance has been linked to creatine supplementation&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39070254/"&gt; by supporting cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. Studies suggest users can improve short-term memory, mental fatigue and overall cognitive processing, especially in situations where the brain's energy demands are elevated, such as during periods of high stress, sleep deprivation or intense mental tasks. This supplement has been especially helpful with aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent discovery has to do with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54249-9"&gt;mental and physical performance after poor sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Creatine supplementation may help mitigate some of the negative effects of poor sleep by supporting energy availability in the brain and muscles. While not a substitute for adequate rest, creatine may offer some resilience against the cognitive and physical declines associated with occasional inadequate sleep. For the tactical professional, this holds much promise for shift work and broken sleep periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, though, that the effectiveness of creatine may vary, depending on the intensity of training and the availability of hydration before, during and after training. In some cases, it can even be detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although you can take creatine as a civilian and in the military before entering military special ops service programs, I still do not recommend it. Many supplements create psychological and physiological needs through their use during strength training and muscle development, and that can be an issue in high-attrition training programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot and should not take it during actual military training programs that require long hours of intense physical activity in less than hospitable environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Want to Learn More About Military Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you're thinking of joining the military, looking for fitness and basic training tips, or keeping up with military life and benefits, Military.com has you covered. &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/profile/member-profile-newsletter-settings.html"&gt;Subscribe to Military.com&lt;/a&gt; to have military news, updates and resources delivered directly to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

No deaths were reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin County didn't have any confirmed cases in 2024 or 2023, according to FDOH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Florida had 19 confirmed deaths from Vibrio, attributed to conditions created by Hurricane Helene. Vibrio vulnificus thrives in warm, coastal seawater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.wptv.com/news/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-cases-on-the-rise-in-florida-after-hurricanes-helene-milton" target="_blank"&gt;two deaths in Palm Beach County&lt;/a&gt; in 2024. There are no reported cases or deaths in the county so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDOH warns people not to enter the ocean if they have fresh cuts or scrapes. It also advises those who are immunocompromised wear proper footwear to prevent cuts or injury while on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Out of 100 marathoners and ultramarathoners between the ages of 35 and 50 who underwent colonoscopies, 42 had polyps, or which 15 were considered advanced pre-cancerous growths. These are bigger numbers than you’d expect, and the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;’s &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; on the research has sparked a wave of concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="publisher_div"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not here to dismiss those concerns. Admittedly, as a runner and running journalist, I hope the current version of the story turns out to be wrong. And it’s easy to poke holes in studies whose results you don’t like: this one doesn’t have a control group, for example, and hasn’t yet been through peer review. But what I really want is to understand whether there are genuine risks that runners need to consider, which is a question that will take further research to answer. For now, here are a few thoughts about the broader context of these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; The Links Between Fitness and Colon Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been plenty of previous studies on how exercise and aerobic fitness affect the risk of colon cancer. The overall conclusion is that being fitter reduces your risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI0" class="col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37382952/"&gt;a 2023 Swedish study&lt;/a&gt; of 177,000 men found that those with the highest fitness (as assessed with an exercise test to estimate &lt;a target="_self" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/vo2-max-just-turned-100-heres-what-it-means/"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt;) were least likely to develop colon cancer over the subsequent decade. Here’s a graph showing their risk as a function of fitness:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_2714071" class="pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2714071" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-1.jpg?width=730" alt="Incidence of colon cancer is less for those with higher VO2 max." srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-1.jpg?width=300 300w, https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-1.jpg?width=768 768w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__caption"&gt;Incidence of colon cancer is less for those with higher VO2 max.&lt;/span&gt; (Photo: JAMA Network Open)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that the graph gets steadily lower with increasing fitness: there’s no hint that it turns up for the fittest people. The highest value of VO2 max on this graph is 55 ml/min/kg, which &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://vdoto2.com/calculator/"&gt;corresponds very loosely&lt;/a&gt; to a marathon time of a little under three hours. These are seriously fit people, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study of 643,000 U.S. military veterans, &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(25)00155-7/abstract"&gt;published last month&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&lt;/i&gt;, found a similar pattern. Those with the highest fitness were less than half as likely as the least fit subjects to develop colon cancer over time. Here’s that data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2714072" class="pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2714072" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-2.jpg?width=730" alt="Higher fitness reduces colon cancer risk for military veterans." srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-2.jpg?width=300 300w, https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-2.jpg?width=768 768w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__caption"&gt;Higher fitness reduces colon cancer risk for military veterans.&lt;/span&gt; (Photo: Mayo Clinic Proceedings)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this graph, each line shows the fraction of people who have &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; been diagnosed with colorectal cancer, so the higher lines have fewer cases. The “high-fit” group here has aerobic fitness of 13.6 METs, on average, which corresponds to a VO2 max of about 48 ml/min/kg—once again a fairly impressive level of fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a high VO2 max is partly genetic, so it’s also worth looking at the data on exercise habits and colon cancer risk. Once again, the relationship is pretty clear. There’s representative data in &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7048166/"&gt;a 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; that merges data from nine previous studies with a total of 755,000 subjects. Here’s the link between amount of exercise per week and risk of colon cancer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2714074" class="pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2714074" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-3.jpg?width=730" alt="The more you exercise, the less likely you are to develop colon cancer." srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-3.jpg?width=300 300w, https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/colon-3.jpg?width=768 768w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__caption"&gt;The more you exercise, the less likely you are to develop colon cancer.&lt;/span&gt; (Photo: Journal of Clinical Oncology)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise is measured in MET-hours, which is basically multiples of your basal metabolic rate. The standard recommendation for exercise is 7.5 to 15 MET-hours per week, which corresponds to 150 to 300 minutes of moderate exercise. The highest group in this study was getting 30 MET-hours per week, or roughly 600 minutes (i.e. ten hours) of moderate exercise per week. Again, this is a pretty active group, with no sign of elevated colon cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in-content-leaderboard-I1-P0-CMI0" class="col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Defining “Extreme” Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we reconcile these two datasets? There’s tons of data suggesting that relatively high levels of both exercise and aerobic fitness are really good for reducing the risk of colon cancer. But perhaps the new study is testing a different group of people who are doing “extreme” levels of exercise that aren’t captured in these big studies of regular people. The distinction here echoes the debate a decade ago about &lt;a target="_self" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/extreme-exercise-heart-health-study/"&gt;the potential for heart damage from excessive endurance training&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the initial studies claimed that running as little as 20 miles per week could cause problems, but those studies turned out to have serious statistical flaws. Instead, the “extreme” groups sometimes involved people who had done dozens or even hundreds of ultra-endurance events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion criteria for the new colon cancer study were that you had to have completed at least two ultramarathons of 50K or longer, or else at least five official marathons. In the running world, this wouldn’t qualify you as some sort of crazy fanatic, but it’s certainly more than casual running. Is it enough to mess up your colon? The theory seems to be that prolonged exercise can cause blood to be redirected from the colon, starving the cells there of oxygen and causing inflammation and damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in-content-leaderboard-I2-P0-CMI0" class="col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, it’s simply not possible to say with any confidence whether the new results signal a genuine danger, whether they’re a statistical fluke, or whether there’s another explanation—that the people who volunteered for the colon cancer study tended to be people who had already noticed something strange in their bowel health, for example. The findings should generate a wave of new studies that will help us figure out what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s worth considering what we would do if the results do hold up to scrutiny. There are two points that I think are important to consider. One is that the choice of whether and how much to run is a holistic one: you make it based not just on what it does to your colon, but what it does to your heart and lungs and mind and so on. The overall health risks of running pale in comparison to the risks of &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; exercising. The second point is that, in the meantime, you should take those potential risks seriously. The American Cancer Society &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; regular screening for colon cancer beginning at age 45.&lt;/p&gt;

There are some instances in which it may be appropriate to pop ibuprofen daily, but it's important to discuss this with your doctor first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Daily use of Advil might be needed for a short course for patients with recent surgery or minimally invasive procedures to mitigate the acute inflammation," &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://reinckeveincenter.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Tonie Reincke, MD,;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Tonie Reincke, MD,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;vascular and interventional radiologist at Reincke Vein Center, tells &lt;em&gt;Parade&lt;/em&gt;.

"In these cases, Advil can help keep pain under control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Doctors may recommend taking ibuprofen every day for some long-lasting inflammatory problems, such as ankylosing spondylitis or ongoing muscle and joint pain," he adds. "But this is not something to do on your own; it should always be under a doctor’s guidance."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are other benefits to Advil for pain management as well. "Advil can be an effective approach to pain that is not sedating and carries no risk of addiction," Dr. Hinshelwood says. "Furthermore, it is more effective at controlling pain in acute injuries (such as fractures and post-operative pain) than 'stronger,' opiate based prescriptions, which carry their own set of risks."

That said, there are still some serious risks for some individuals, which is why talking to your doctor is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Smolarz points out that the same function that makes Advil work for pain and inflammation—by blocking enzymes that make chemicals called prostaglandins—can also make it harmful for some: "Those same chemicals also protect your stomach, kidneys and blood vessels," he says. As a result, daily Advil use may potentially cause stomach irritation and ulcers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, he notes, "Your kidneys may not filter blood as well, which can affect blood pressure. Most importantly, because Advil changes how blood clots, it can increase bleeding risks over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Dr. Kadaj reveals that it's possible that daily, longterm Advil use could increase the risk of heart attack and stroke and can increase blood pressure in some patients. "NSAIDs like ibuprofen are linked to thousands of hospitalizations each year," Dr. Kadaj warns. "The risks [for certain people] are real. It can cause ulcers, stomach or GI tract bleeding, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, kidney damage and can also interact with many other meds, specifically blood thinners. We often recommend limiting use to three days at a time unless medically necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, Dr. Reincke warns, "Longer courses of Advil and higher doses can cause heart and liver dysfunction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://parade.com/health/top-back-pain-mistake-to-avoid-according-to-cleveland-clinic-doctor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The #1 Back Pain Mistake to Avoid, According to a Doctor;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The #1 Back Pain Mistake to Avoid, According to a Doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some individuals tend to underestimate the potential dangers associated with this medication, especially since it is readily available over the counter," &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://drnesochi.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Nesochi Okeke-Igbokwe, MD;cpos:18;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Nesochi Okeke-Igbokwe, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, internist, medical expert and CEO of Dr. Nesochi LLC internal medicine practice, advises.

That’s a whole-killed viral vaccine,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Other whole-virus vaccines use live but weakened versions of viruses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ead25c" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell said that over many years of vaccine research, scientists have been able to identify the parts of a virus that are likeliest to activate the immune system and train it to fight back against an invading pathogen. Those parts are known as “antigens.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1dc9b2" class="body-graf"&gt;If the immune system is like the body’s bloodhound, tracking down invaders, then many newer vaccine technologies that target specific antigens present the bloodhound with just the pieces of the invader’s clothes that are most helpful to it. A whole-virus vaccine, on the other hand, would instead be like presenting a bloodhound with an invader’s entire wardrobe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4af3f" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell said that it may sound better at first glance to use the whole virus rather than key pieces of it but that additional pieces of the virus might not actually do anything to improve the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-de923a" class="body-graf"&gt;“For example, hepatitis B vaccine is one antigen, the hepatitis B surface antigen, and it is almost 100% protective against hepatitis B. You do not need the whole hepatitis B virus,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-40ae50" class="body-graf"&gt;Offit agreed. “The hepatitis B vaccine has virtually eliminated hepatitis B infections in young children,” he said. “So that’s good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-afcf7d" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell offered Covid-19 vaccines as another example. “There were whole-virus Covid vaccines, but they weren’t used in the United States, they were used elsewhere, and if you look at the general protection from them, it’s not as good,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ddd07d" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/75/8/1442/6567428" target="_blank"&gt;A study from Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, found that people who got a whole-virus Covid vaccine were more than 1.5 times to twice as likely to be infected than those who had been immunized with an mRNA vaccine that targeted only the virus’ spike protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-343ee7" class="body-graf"&gt;“If killed whole-virus vaccines for Covid were thought to be the best technology to move forward with back when the pandemic started, we would have,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-275e8b" class="body-graf"&gt;Improperly deploying whole-virus vaccines when they aren’t needed isn’t just unnecessary; in some cases, it can be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44689b" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell pointed to the development of the RSV vaccine as a case in point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-66447b" class="body-graf"&gt;“When we used whole-virus killed RSV vaccine many years ago, rather than protect children from RSV, it led to what we call ‘antibody-dependent enhancement,’” he said. “Children had a worse RSV than if they had not been vaccinated, and that was because they had formalin-inactivated whole-virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-191c09" class="body-graf"&gt;That RSV vaccine trial was in the 1960s, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rsv-vaccine-kids-rsv-vaccine-babies-toddlers-rcna53956" target="_blank"&gt;it set research back decades&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fddb9e" class="body-graf"&gt;Ever since then, Campbell said, RSV vaccination has either been directed only against the F protein, a piece of the virus, or it has used a monoclonal antibody, which is like a preformed immune response. The first RSV vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-rsv-vaccine-rcna82461" target="_blank"&gt;approved in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ee35f7" class="body-graf"&gt;“Those protect really well,” he said. “We do not want to use whole-virus killed vaccine for RSV. It will hurt people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ce16fa" class="body-graf"&gt;Some whole-virus vaccines are still used. The hepatitis A and rabies vaccines are killed whole-virus vaccines, meaning they include the constituent pieces of the virus that have been inactivated.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Seasonal flu vaccines also use whole-virus technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a2b931" class="body-graf"&gt;Campbell said it’s possible that a whole-virus vaccine could be an optimal choice for some pathogens in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3062a6" class="body-heading"&gt;In pursuit of a universal flu vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fb337d" class="body-graf"&gt;But as for whether the whole-virus platform will unlock new innovation in the pursuit of a universal flu vaccine, as &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-nih-announces-generation-gold-standard.html" target="_blank"&gt;suggested by the Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;, Campbell said that it would be possible to use whole-virus vaccines if they could be genetically engineered to express multiple flu strain antigens but that it doesn’t have much to do with the whole-virus platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb027f" class="body-graf"&gt;“If it’s just whole-virus, and it’s one strain, that’s what we do now,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dabe8c" class="body-graf"&gt;Emily Hilliard, the press secretary for HHS, said in a statement: “Generation Gold Standard marks a critical step in restoring strategic focus and radical transparency to America’s pandemic preparedness.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7cf4fb" class="body-graf"&gt;“Developed entirely by government scientists — free from industry influence — the BPL vaccine platform could provide broad, long-lasting protection against all influenza viral pathogens, including influenza and coronaviruses, with the added potential to block transmission and stop outbreaks at the source,” Hilliard said. BPL, or beta-propiolactone, is a chemical that has been used for decades to kill the viruses used in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7fe59" class="body-graf"&gt;A universal flu vaccine has been a longtime goal of scientists, as it would ideally offer yearslong protection against the flu. Because of how quickly the virus mutates, yearly flu shots are needed to protect against the most current strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-531f45" class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s a lot of different avenues that people are working, and if we choose only one of those — especially one that’s a very old technology that people have tried so many times before and failed to make a universal flu vaccine — I think it’s putting all our eggs in one basket and not really moving the field along,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b7ea0" class="body-graf"&gt;Offit said withdrawing research funding for mRNA vaccines could be particularly harmful in the event of a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db97aa" class="body-graf"&gt;“If something bad happens, like there is a bird flu pandemic, for example, we will be less prepared,” he said, adding that mRNA technology has a shorter production cycle than whole-killed virus vaccines, meaning an mRNA vaccine would be available much sooner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f71e0" class="body-graf"&gt;Rasmussen said, “We’d probably need a year to scale to full national scale manufacturing” using a whole-virus vaccine, adding, “You actually have to grow a ton of virus and then inactivate it and then make sure it’s inactivated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00f42b" class="body-graf"&gt;With other vaccine technologies, like protein subunit or mRNA, “you basically just make the protein or the mRNA, which can be done synthetically, without requiring any virus or anything to grow it in,” she said. “They’re much easier to change and adapt as needed, as new strains might emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d6de49" class="body-graf"&gt;Offit said, “One of the studies among the 22 studies that were eliminated in that $500 million withdrawal was looking at to what extent the mRNA technology would be valuable for bird flu.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-606388" class="body-graf"&gt;Ultimately, Campbell said, science should lead the way, not top-down dicta that tie scientists’ hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1e89d" class="body-graf"&gt;“The devil is in the details, not just in sweeping statements about what platform is an appropriate platform and which is not,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-923237" class="body-graf"&gt;Multiple platforms are available for vaccine development, which are tested for their respective properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2b3492" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Eventually, one or two, maybe, rise to look the best, and those are the ones that people continue to pursue,” he said. “That’s what we do in vaccinology, is try to figure out what works and what doesn’t work, both by basic science, by immunology, by models of diseases, before they get into humans, and then actual human studies to compare and contrast immune responses, safety and protection, not just sweeping statements about platform.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC

Kennedy Jr has called for the retraction of a Danish study that found no link between aluminium in vaccines and chronic diseases in children — a rare move for a US public official. Aluminium has been used for almost a century to enhance the immune system’s response to some vaccines. But some people claim the ingredient is linked to rising rates of childhood disorders such as autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Public-health officials in Kennedy’s position rarely request that studies be retracted, says Ivan Oransky, a specialist in academic publishing and co-founder of the media organization Retraction Watch. Through this request, “Secretary Kennedy has demonstrated that he wants the scientific literature to bend to his will”, says Oransky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study in question, published in &lt;i&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/i&gt; in July, is one of the largest of its kind, looking at 1.2 million children born over more than two decades in Denmark. The authors reported that no significant risk of developing autoimmune, allergic or neurodevelopmental disorders was associated with exposure to aluminium compounds in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/newsletters/?utm_source=yahoo_news&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:[Sign up for Today in Science, a free daily newsletter];elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;[Sign up for Today in Science, a free daily newsletter]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/flawed-science-bought-conclusions-the-aluminum-vaccine-study-the-media-wont-question-aaec2793" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:opinion piece;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; published on TrialSite News on 1 August, Kennedy called into question the study’s methodology, analysis and results. Since his appointment as head of the US Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01852-z" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bypassed normal scientific review processes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;bypassed normal scientific review processes&lt;/a&gt; to change vaccine recommendations and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02612-9" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:terminated grants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;terminated grants&lt;/a&gt; for projects on mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/i&gt; says it stands by the study and has no plans to retract it. Christine Laine, editor in chief for the journal, wrote in a comment on the study’s web page on 11 August that “retraction is warranted only when serious errors invalidate findings or there is documented scientific misconduct, neither of which occurred here”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services said that Kennedy’s article spoke for itself, and that the department did not have any further comment in response to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;’s questions about Kennedy's request for a retraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Widely used&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Aluminium, in the form of salts, such as potassium aluminium sulfate, have been administered in vaccines — for diseases ranging from whooping cough to pneumonia — to millions of people worldwide, and the vaccines have been widely studied for safety issues. Gary Grohmann, an independent virologist in Canberra, says there is no evidence of significant side effects caused by the small amount of aluminium in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But in 2011, a study published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry&lt;/i&gt; claimed to show a causal relationship between rising autism diagnoses in children and increased exposure to aluminium-containing vaccines. In 2012, the World Health Organization’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety said the study and another by the same authors were “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety/topics/adjuvants" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seriously flawed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;seriously flawed&lt;/a&gt;” because they used inappropriate study designs, incorrect assumptions and questionable data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Since then, Grohmann says, the claim that aluminium in vaccines causes autism has been debunked “again and again”. “If there was a mechanism of action where a particular vaccine caused autism, we’d see it in 80, 90, 100% of people receiving the vaccine, and we don’t,” he says. Any association between autism and vaccines is probably a coincidence of timing, he says. “In other words, vaccines might be given at the age of two, and autism genetically might also kick in at the age of two,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Allen Cheng, an epidemiologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, says the Danish study adds to the evidence that vaccines containing aluminium are safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Kennedy’s concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Among Kennedy’s criticisms of the Danish study are that the analysis excluded children who had died before the age of two. According to Kennedy, this means that the children “most likely to reveal injuries” associated with aluminum exposure were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy also criticized the fact that the authors did not compare vaccinated and unvaccinated children to determine whether any aluminium exposure causes harm, even though they had some data on unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other critiques posted on the journal website overlapped with Kennedy’s criticisms, says Anders Hviid, the senior author and an epidemiologist at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark’s public-health agency. Hviid says he and his colleagues addressed the critiques “one by one”. He also published a &lt;a href="https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/data-vs.-doubt-danish-scientist-responds-to-u.s.-hhs-secretary-critique-of-aluminum-vaccine-study-290120e9" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rebuttal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;rebuttal&lt;/a&gt; of Kennedy’s article on TrialSite News on 3 August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In one response on the study’s webpage, the Danish researchers said they did not use unvaccinated children as a control group because completely unvaccinated children were rare — only 1.2% (15,200) of the 1.2 million children in the study did not receive a vaccine containing aluminium before age two. Such a small group would have made their statistical analysis imprecise, the researchers said. Instead, they compared the relationship between the risk of developing childhood disorders and how much aluminium in vaccine children were exposed to, ranging from 0 mg to 4.5 mg, before the age of two. But they acknowledged that the study did not evaluate whether any exposure, regardless of the total, increased the risk of childhood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In another response, the researchers said they excluded children who experienced outcomes or died before age two to allow for the expected lag between symptom onset and diagnosis. They noted that most disorders could not reliably be diagnosed before age two. Their additional analysis of outcomes starting at 14 months showed similar results to their main findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy’s article also refers to a secondary analysis in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/suppl/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997/suppl_file/annals-25-00997_supplement.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supplementary data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;supplementary data&lt;/a&gt;, which he claims “contradicts the study’s conclusions”. The analysis showed there was no overall risk of developing neurodevelopmental disorders with increasing aluminium exposure, but Kennedy pointed out there was a 67% increased risk of Asperger syndrome for every 1 mg increase in aluminium for children born after 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The authors said that analysis should be interpreted cautiously. They didn't include it in their main findings because the underlying data were incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hviid says Kennedy’s call for retraction has not fazed him. He and his colleagues presented their preliminary data, which showed similar results to those of the final study, to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in 2023.

Those with higher purpose were 28% less likely to develop cognitive impairment, even when accounting for genetic risk and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect was consistent across racial and ethnic groups and modestly delayed the onset of decline by more than a month over eight years. The findings suggest that building purpose through relationships, goals, or meaningful activities may help keep the brain resilient with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher life purpose reduced dementia risk by 28%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Protective effects held across racial, ethnic, and genetic risk groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free &amp;amp; Accessible:&lt;/strong&gt; Purpose offers a safe, low-cost protective factor compared to drugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Davis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research into Blue Zones — regions of the world where people tend to live longer — shows that having a sense of purpose in life may help people live longer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, new research from UC Davis shows that having a sense of purpose in life may have another benefit as people age: reducing the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, published in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, followed over 13,000 adults aged 45 and older for up to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that people who reported a higher sense of purpose in life were about 28% less likely to develop cognitive impairment — including mild cognitive impairment and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protective effect of having a purpose was seen across racial and ethnic groups. It also remained significant even after accounting for education, depression and the &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; gene, which is a known risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose in life helps the brain stay resilient&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that having a sense of purpose helps the brain stay resilient with age,” said Aliza Wingo, senior author and professor in the UC Davis Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even for people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, sense of purpose was linked to a later onset and lower likelihood of developing dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were not specifically asked about the activities that gave their life purpose. Previous studies on aging, though, have found a wide rang of activities give older adults a sense of life purpose, sometimes referred to as “&lt;a href="https://www.japan.go.jp/kizuna/2022/03/ikigai_japanese_secret_to_a_joyful_life.html"&gt;ikigai&lt;/a&gt;.” These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relationships: Caring for family, spending time with grandchildren or supporting a spouse or friend.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;volunteering: Continuing professional work, mentoring or contributing to community causes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spirituality or faith: Religious beliefs, spiritual practices or involvement in faith-based communities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personal goals: Pursuing hobbies, learning new skills or setting and achieving personal milestones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Helping others: Acts of kindness, philanthropy, caregiving or advocacy work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose delays onset of cognitive decline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that people with higher purpose tended to experience cognitive decline later than those with lower purpose. On average, the delay in onset was very modest — about 1.4 months over an eight-year period, after considering the effects of age, education, depressive symptoms, and genetic risk. However, it is meaningful when compared to current treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While medications like lecanemab and donanemab can modestly delay symptoms of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease, they come with risks and costs,” said Nicholas C. Howard, first author and public health researcher at UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Purpose in life is free, safe and accessible. It’s something people can build through relationships, goals and meaningful activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods and limitations of study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the study were part of the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative survey funded by the National Institute on Aging. All had normal cognitive health at the beginning of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used a seven-item survey from the Ryff Measures of Psychological Well-being.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants had six possible responses (from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”) for statements such as: “I am an active person in carrying out the plans I set for myself” and “I have a sense of direction and purpose in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their answers were scored and averaged to obtain a well-being number between 1 and 6, with higher values indicating a strong sense of purpose in life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their cognitive health was tracked using a telephone-based test every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted the study has many strengths, including the size of the population studied. However, a key limitation is that although there was an association, the study did not prove higher levels of purpose caused the lowered rates of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings support role of psychological well-being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the findings support the idea that psychological well-being plays a key role in healthy aging, said Thomas Wingo, a co-author of the study and a professor and neurologist at UC Davis Health. Wingo hopes future studies will explore whether purpose-building interventions can help prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s exciting about this study is that people may be able to ‘think’ themselves into better health. Purpose in life is something we can nurture,” he said. “It’s never too early — or too late — to start thinking about what gives your life meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurology and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#573b323f3820362533173f32363b233f7922343336213e2479323322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lisa Howard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://health.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;UC Davis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lisa Howard – UC Davis&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2025.05.009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Life Purpose Lowers Risk for Cognitive Impairment in a United States Population-Based Cohort&lt;/a&gt;” by Aliza Wingo et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life Purpose Lowers Risk for Cognitive Impairment in a United States Population-Based Cohort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether sense of purpose in life (PiL) is associated with a lower risk for and delayed onset of developing cognitive impairment in a diverse US population-based cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants from the Health and Retirement Study aged 45 or older with normal cognitive performance at baseline and ≥ 2 subsequent objective cognitive assessments were included. Cognitive performance was objectively assessed biennially using the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (mTICS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment was defined as having two consecutive visits with mTICS scores below a psychometrically validated threshold consistent with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. PiL was assessed at baseline using a seven-item questionnaire. Cox Proportional Hazards was modelled to examine the association between PiL and cognitive impairment. Restricted Mean Survival Times was calculated to estimate delay in onset age for cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 13,765 participants, 1,820 (13%) developed cognitive impairment during follow-up (median of 8 years and up to 15 years). Those with higher PiL had significantly lower risk for developing cognitive impairment compared to those with lower PiL after adjusting for sex, baseline age, educational attainment, average depressive symptom score, and race/ethnicity (HR = 0.72, 95% CI: [0.63–0.82]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This association remained significant after adjusting for &lt;em&gt;APOE E4&lt;/em&gt; in addition to the above covariates in a subset with genotyping data. Furthermore, participants with higher PiL had a later onset age for cognitive impairment compared to participants with lower PiL after accounting for these covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher PiL was associated with approximately 28% lower risk for developing cognitive impairment and a later onset of cognitive impairment across the studied ethnic/racial groups, even among those with genetic risk for dementia. These findings indicate that fostering a sense of life purpose has the potential to reduce cognitive impairment and dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 19:31:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE9JQTdZVjRKcW9RVUFURlNtUE5KNzQ5Z2l0anV0VC1EUjhhd2dxdEpTRHBrNndHQkt1TmpYSmpuZHFpTEhxbElpUXpiRHcwT3FSTUY5bVBYVEhGeW90ZklFZDVzZjJ6bi1LT0dZ</guid></item><item><title>美国疾控中心任命疫苗怀疑论者领导新冠肺炎委员会-路透社</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-taps-vaccine-skeptic-lead-covid-committee-2025-08-25/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 19:29:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNaVhidFNQdERXZ3JaS3FQNXNHMWZnVjFjenl6TW1ZMWJldktFUmZ0NmNUYUlySEoxVWNrSkxUNDhCeUtPRkJIeVRQOUo3SXpEMzhuOGVKN1MxRzZmVkxTb3hJa2k1NjFYQmVEQkhHYi1CWWliMDEzNUJselE3LUd1czRzRGlwUDdaWGZCMl9PTHdMck1pOERTejNZWms4ZUEzTFdreURURHVCMm8wSFBxcWdHQjE2YzZ0YnRUcQ</guid></item><item><title>中国首次尝试对脑死亡者进行猪人肺移植- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/surgery/first-ever-pig-to-human-lung-transplant-attempted-in-brain-dead-person-in-china</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

"Lung xenotransplantation presents unique biological and technical challenges compared to other organs." The aim of the study was to investigate how the human immune system might react to such a transplant, "not to claim clinical readiness today," Shi added. In other words, the technique is not yet ready for prime time in living patients; it's still in preclinical investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once transplanted, the pig lung "maintained viability and functionality" for nine days, even though it showed signs of rejection as early as 24 hours after the procedure. The experiment ended on Day 9 at the request of the patient's family. From the report, it's unclear how much longer the lung might have lasted had it been left in for longer, but the organ had accrued damage by Day 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/can-you-transplant-an-organ-more-than-once" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/can-you-transplant-an-organ-more-than-once"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you transplant an organ more than once?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-jggWJ8SVVdL6WohaZYQr56" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-jggWJ8SVVdL6WohaZYQr56 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nobody would sign up for a nine-day lung transplant," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1184883589/adam-griesemer" target="_blank" data-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1184883589/adam-griesemer" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Adam Griesemer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a senior member of the xenotransplantation team for NYU Langone's Transplant Institute who was not involved in the procedure, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/25/health/first-pig-to-human-lung-transplant" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/25/health/first-pig-to-human-lung-transplant" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told CNN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That said, "I think it is very important to do these studies [in brain-dead people] since you can't assume that the animal models are going to perfectly reflect what happens in human recipients," Griesemer added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment involved a lung from a pig that had been genetically modified using the gene-editing technology &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRISPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; a company called Clonorgan Biotechnology in Chengdu, China, handled the editing. Three of the pig's genes were disabled so that the proteins for which they code wouldn't activate the human immune system; three human genes were also added in an attempt to make the organ more tolerable to a human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, the transplant team removed the left lung of the pig and transplanted it into the brain-dead patient, who retained his right lung. Immunosuppressive drugs were introduced to the patient's body starting one day before the procedure and were given daily following the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient's body didn't show signs of "hyperacute rejection," which would have taken place immediately after the transplantation if it did manifest. Although the lung made it over that initial hump, signs of rejection began to emerge around the 24-hour mark, marked by swelling and inflammation. The immune system generated &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/antibodies.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antibodies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against the organ by the third day after the operation, resulting in some damage to the lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggested that for future attempts at this type of experiment, it might help to block the action of specific immune cells, as well as to suppress certain signaling molecules that ramp up inflammation. The lungs present a huge challenge because, given that they're constantly exposed to air from outside the body, they carry many proteins geared toward immune defense — this paradoxically makes them an easy target for the host immune system to see as "foreign." Additionally, their tissue that exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide is very delicate, meaning any immune attacks launched against them pack a punch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="026058c0-b4e4-49f3-94c1-a2a666fcd9eb"&gt;Other questions remain about how to improve upon the approach and how well it could work for a living patient. Based on the current study, for instance, it's unclear how well the pig lung could have supported the patient if he was removed from life-support machines, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/20280/richard-pierson" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/20280/richard-pierson" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Richard Pierson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thoracic transplant surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who was not involved with the recent procedure, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-pig-to-human-lung-transplant" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-pig-to-human-lung-transplant" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told Science News&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Future studies can refine the approach to lung xenotransplantation and move closer to clinical translation," the study authors concluded. "This study provides crucial insights into the immune, physiological and genetic barriers that must be overcome, and paves the way for further innovations in the field."&lt;/p&gt;

In experiments, the pattern appeared during mental breaks and predicted when people would soon turn their thoughts inward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of more than 1,000 brain scans confirmed that those with high self-preoccupation showed stronger fluctuations in this neural activity at rest. The findings highlight a potential biomarker for vulnerability to mental health conditions and a new target for early interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Signature:&lt;/strong&gt; A brain activity pattern predicts when self-focused thoughts arise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Stronger fluctuations in this pattern are tied to anxiety and depression risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large-Scale Validation:&lt;/strong&gt; Results replicated in more than 1,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People tend to be self-preoccupied. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-interest is good when it ensures that one’s needs are met, but it can also be maladaptive; research shows that the tendency to self-focus promotes the occurrence of depression and anxiety and can even prolong these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a neural representation of self-preoccupation? Danika Geisler and Meghan Meyer, from Colombia University, explored this question in their new &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience &lt;/em&gt;paper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers first identified a pattern of neural activity that frequently appeared in a sample of 32 people while they took a mental break. This activity could predict whether people started thinking about themselves during the break a few seconds later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geisler and Meyer then turned to a broadly used publicly available database called the Human Connectome project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the data of 1,086 people, the researchers found that people who scored high on internalizing—a maladaptive form of self-preoccupied thinking—also moved in and out of this neural activity pattern during rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the tendency to engage in self-centric thinking may be reflected by fluctuating activity in distinct brain areas during rest.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Says Meyer, “We are excited to see what other aspects of everyday life our neural signature of self-preoccupation can predict. For example, Danika is working on an exciting project examining whether engaging this neural signature predicts people’s real-world social network positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are also interested in seeing if this neural signature can prospectively predict the onset of depression or anxiety; if so, intervening on this neural signature could offset the development of these mental health conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#076a62636e664774616929687560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0037-25.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A Neural Signature of the Bias Toward Self-Focus&lt;/a&gt;” by Danika Geisler et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Neural Signature of the Bias Toward Self-Focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are remarkably self-focused, disproportionately choosing to think about themselves relative to other topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-focus can be adaptive, helping individuals fulfill their needs. It can also be maladaptive, with self-focus a risk and maintenance factor for internalizing disorders like depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the drive to focus on the self remains to be fully characterized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered a brain pattern that when spontaneously brought online during a quick mental break predicts the desire to focus on oneself just a few seconds later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Study 1 (19 female and 13 male human subjects), we identified a default network neural signature from pre-trial activity that predicts multiple indicators of self-focus within our sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Study 2 (588 female and 498 male human subjects), we applied our neural signature to independent resting-state data from the Human Connectome project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that individuals who score high on internalizing, a form of maladaptive self-focus, similarly move in-and-out of this pattern during rest, suggesting a systematic trajectory towards self-focused thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first work to “decode” the bias to focus on the self and paves the way towards stopping maladaptive self-focus in its course.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 18:48:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFA0bjVFazJ6NnRlZVFiWWJTSzVtN1ZCZTR1dnh3elJDWThWLWc2MzZ1Y2wzOFFmQ09xT2pEM1dSVzZHaUQ5MUtIeUVESlpQR2RKMkRqNHZoUFNTSVRoUmRqTHh4cnllOXd3cXViZFVTOUxMZw</guid></item><item><title>增加心力衰竭风险的“无声”疾病……你有吗？ --《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15031951/The-silent-disease-raises-risk-heart-failure-YOU-it.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New research reveals a strong link between a common liver disease affecting nearly 90 million Americans and heart failure, with nearly half of patients showing early signs of heart damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from Duke University examined the health data of 570 patients at the university’s hospital system who had metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which, according to the most recent data, affects more than 86 million Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They tracked the patients’ medical histories for 11 years from the time they were diagnosed with MASLD, a condition where &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12214597/Are-one-100MILLION-Americans-fatty-liver-disease-causing-liver-failure-CANCER.html"&gt;excess fat builds up in the liver&lt;/a&gt; and can lead to inflammation and scarring over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almost a fifth of patients&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6998481/Heart-failure-deaths-surging-young-Americans-study-finds.html"&gt; developed heart failure &lt;/a&gt;over that period, while nearly half showed signs of heart failure despite never being formally diagnosed with a cardiac condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The burden of MASLD in the US is significant, affecting more than one in three US adults on average. The disease stems from the body's difficulty processing fats and sugars and often progresses without causing noticeable symptoms until it reaches a severe, sometimes irreversible, stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person in the early stages of disease can have a significant amount of liver fat and some scarring without feeling sick, allowing the disease to progress undetected for years or even decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest research found that as MASLD slowly and silently scars the liver until it can no longer filter toxins from the blood, the heart becomes progressively weaker and prone to failure. Yet only five percent of patients in the study had ever been diagnosed with heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marat Fudim, a researcher at Duke Clinical Research Institute and co-author of the report, said in a statement: ‘The findings highlight a critical gap in the recognition and diagnosis of heart failure in this high-risk group.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Nearly 100 million Americans have a chronic liver disease that results when too much fat builds up and causes scarring (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers specifically selected 570 patients with MASLD that was confirmed by a liver biopsy - ‘the gold standard for diagnosis,’ Dr Fudim said, because it provides the most accurate diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patients had been diagnosed with MASLD between 2007 and 2013 and were followed until they died or until January 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of the study population was about 50 years. Less than two percent had been diagnosed with heart failure before the liver biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 40 percent had diabetes, 59 percent had high blood pressure and almost 60 percent had high levels of fat in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seventy-one patients (12.5 percent) died during the study’s follow-up period. Of these, nine were liver-related, three were due to cardiovascular causes, 23 were due to other known causes, and the cause of death could not be ascertained on manual chart review in 36 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over that period, researchers found that 100 patients in the study met the criteria for heart failure despite not having been formally diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those with stage 4-level liver scarring, indicating the most advanced form of the disease, 33 percent who had not been diagnosed before the study were deemed to have heart failure by the researchers when the study was completed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The biggest risk factors were being older and female, potentially due to decreasing levels of estrogen, which protects against liver dysfunction, as women age. Other conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, also increased the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph comes from an unrelated study that projected the number of US adults with MASLD will rise from 86 million (33.7 percent) in 2020 to 122 million (41.4 percent) by 2050&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;The lack of symptoms of MASLD in the early stages leads to patients being diagnosed at a point where damage to the liver may be extensive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also looked for early warning signs of heart failure, such as shortness of breath, swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet, irregular or rapid heartbeat, and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also considered how many times people had been hospitalized for heart trouble, blood tests showing key markers of heart strain, and scans showing the heart was stiff and had trouble filling with blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They discovered that many more people had clues pointing to heart problems than those who actually developed diagnosable heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly half of all the patients showed these early warning signs during the study, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 6.7 million Americans are living with heart failure, and it is the direct cause of approximately 8.5 percent of all deaths from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Duke gastroenterologist and lead author Dr Kara Wegermann said: ‘Our findings point to the under diagnosis of HF and lack of recognition of diastolic dysfunction in patients with MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There is a real opportunity to develop better screening strategies so we can identify these patients earlier or even prevent symptomatic heart failure.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on their findings, the study authors strongly recommend implementing targeted heart screening for MASLD patients who are at the highest risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They specifically suggested that individuals who also have diabetes, high cholesterol, or are female should receive regular and proactive heart check-ups, which would allow doctors to detect heart failure much earlier in these vulnerable groups, leading to timelier intervention and better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03891-5" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using data from more than 5,700 people gathered over 34 years found that the participants who stuck to the Mediterranean diet were less likely to wind up with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; benefit cropped up in the people who had the highest genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease—those with two copies of the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) variant. (For reference, carrying just one of these genes makes you three to four times as likely to develop the disease; sport two of them, and that jumps to a 12-fold risk compared to those with none.) Participants in the double APOE4 camp who followed a baseline Mediterranean diet were 35% less likely to get dementia, and the more closely their diet tracked with the Mediterranean ideal, the more they slashed their risk. (By comparison, people with zero or one APOE4 variant experienced more modest benefits, around 5% risk reduction.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get at why, the researchers dug into the metabolic profiles of people in each genetic risk group. It’s been previously shown that the APOE4 variant can affect how people process or metabolize certain foods, particularly lipids (a.k.a. fats), &lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/147408" target="_blank"&gt;Yuxi Liu, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, first author on the study and a research fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, tells SELF. For starters, it can trigger &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05439-w" target="_blank"&gt;accumulation of certain lipids&lt;/a&gt; in the brain, sparking the kind of &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/how-to-reduce-inflammation-in-the-body" target="_blank"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that can cause damage and put you on a slippery slope to dementia. Dr. Liu and her team pinpointed several differences in fat-related and other metabolic outcomes in the double-APOE4 folks that could explain why they were both much more at risk for dementia &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; more responsive to the helpful influence of the Med diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall thinking is that having two APOE4 variants messes with elements of your metabolism, and subscribing to the Mediterranean diet could help resolve that disruption by supplying your body and brain with a surplus of certain nutrients. That’s a huge deal since you can’t control your genes—but you can certainly determine what foods you eat. And while it’s long been thought that there was little you could do to meaningfully stave off cognitive decline if you were stuck with the highest-risk genetic profile for Alzheimer’s, this new research suggests otherwise. Exactly which aspects of the Mediterranean diet are responsible for the bulk of the potential benefits and how they drive those changes could be great subjects for future research, Dr. Liu points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for now, we know that there’s plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/foods-to-prevent-dementia" target="_blank"&gt;brain-related upsides&lt;/a&gt; to generally following the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/mediterranean-diet" target="_blank"&gt;Mediterranean approach&lt;/a&gt;, which, again, hinges on eating lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and cutting back on red and processed meats and &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/research-health-impact-alcohol" target="_blank"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;. Previous research has found that older folks who closely followed a version of the Mediterranean diet called the MIND diet (Mediterranean-Dash Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) experienced &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38407506/" target="_blank"&gt;slower aging&lt;/a&gt; and were less likely to develop dementia over the course of 14 years than those who didn’t; and several other &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02772-3" target="_blank"&gt;large&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2016.00022/full" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2016.00022/full"}' href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2016.00022/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have identified the risk-reducing powers of the Med diet for dementia, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1279770725000880" target="_blank"&gt;particularly in women&lt;/a&gt;, and as it relates to certain &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000207176" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000207176"}' href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000207176" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s-related features&lt;/a&gt; in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the reason Dr. Liu is so excited about the future of diet-dementia studies: We’re approaching an era of “precision nutrition,” she says, where we might soon be able to prescribe specific dietary interventions tailored to people’s genetic backgrounds, and actively thwart their dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.self.com/newsletter/self-daily" target="_blank"&gt;Get more of SELF’s great service journalism delivered right to your inbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SELF Magazine</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 17:58:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9SY2w3QkwzUjVmZVJXdm5tNHFBbXV3UFF4bHlqN1NZY05CcWNoX1NIc1I4MUU0alk4ZlpqUWwyVzJxdkw0aFMwU0IwTS02VEZiYmkxUS1Yc1VJb0NsMGdOSjJlaHRkRmljYWJfRFc5a3dCeUd4NXJVYlpR</guid></item><item><title>口腔到肠道细菌迁移解释了为什么吸烟对发炎的肠道有好处- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-08-mouth-gut-bacteria-migration-good.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by Hiroshi Ohno at the RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences (IMS) in Japan have discovered why smoking tobacco helps people suffering from ulcerative colitis, a chronic disease typified by inflammation of the large intestine.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2025/08/06/gutjnl-2025-334922" target="_blank"&gt;Published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Gut&lt;/i&gt;, the study shows that smoking produces metabolites that encourage bacteria from the mouth to grow in the large intestines where they trigger an immune response. These findings imply that protection against ulcerative colitis can be achieved through prebiotics like hydroquinone or probiotic therapy with bacteria like Streptococcus mitis, thus eliminating the need to smoke and all the associated risks for other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory bowel disease comes in two main varieties, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Although both cause chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/weight+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, their causes and the exact type and location of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; differ. Along with these differences is a mystery that has puzzled doctors and scientists for over 40 years; smoking increases the risk of Crohn's disease but somehow protects against ulcerative colitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both diseases are related to gut inflammation—which is an immune response—and gut immunity depends in part on the types of bacteria in the gut, Ohno and his team at RIKEN IMS set out to investigate whether the differential effects of smoking on these diseases can be explained by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers used a combination of human clinical data and experiments with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; to reach their conclusions. Among those with ulcerative colitis, they found that smokers had certain bacteria usually found in the mouth, such as Streptococcus, growing in the gut, specifically in the colonic mucosa that cover the inner lining of the intestines. This phenomenon did not occur in ex-smokers. Thus, while these bacteria normally pass all the way through the digestive system as we swallow saliva throughout the day, smoking somehow allows them to settle down in the gut mucosa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next question was why? The researchers also examined gut metabolites—small substances produced in the gut when food is broken down and processed by the body and gut bacteria. They found that levels of several gut metabolites were higher in smokers with ulcerative colitis than in ex-smokers with colitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mice, the researchers found that one of these metabolites, called hydroquinone, promoted the growth of Streptococcus in the gut mucosa. So, smoking-related metabolites like hydroquinone allow mouth bacteria like Streptococcus to flourish in the mucus layer that covers the inner lining of the intestines. But how do these bacteria help reduce inflammation? And why don't they help in Crohn's disease?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then went back to the oral bacteria that they had discovered was growing in the gut mucosa of smokers with ulcerative colitis, and isolated 10 strains from the saliva of smokers. When they treated mouse models of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with each of these 10 strains for five days, they found that giving the mice Streptococcus mitis had almost the same effect as smoking. Inflammation was reduced in mice with ulcerative colitis and exacerbated in mice with Crohn's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Analysis showed that S. mitis triggered the emergence of helper Th1 cells, which are an important part of the gut's immune response to invaders. In Crohn's disease, this likely worsens the condition because the original inflammation is actually caused by these same helper Th1 cells. But in colitis, the Th1 cells fight against an initial Th2-immune response, and this ends up reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As smoking poses high risks for cancer, heart disease, and many other illnesses, it is not a sustainable treatment for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/ulcerative+colitis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;ulcerative colitis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results indicate the relocation of bacteria from the mouth to the gut, particularly those of the Streptococcus genus, and the subsequent &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+response/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune response&lt;/a&gt; in the gut, is the mechanism through which smoking helps protect against the disease," says Ohno. "Logically, direct treatment with this kind of bacteria, or indirect treatment with hydroquinone, is thus likely to mimic the beneficial effects of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/smoking/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; but avoid all the negative effects."&lt;/p&gt;

You use your plastic brush to lather a paste pushed from a plastic tube. When you have a cavity, you go to a dentist who might fill the hole with a plastic composite then sand it flush right there in your mouth. Say you grind your teeth at night. Your dentist might prescribe you a fitted piece of cured acrylic to grind into instead, the surface of which eventually gets visibly rough and worn. Perhaps your teeth are not very straight, so you contemplate getting aligners—thin sheets of thermoplastic that would be heated and then molded to the contours of your mouth and that you would need to wear almost constantly. The retainers you’d wear afterward to keep your newly straight teeth in place might also be plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly every part of modern dentistry and orthodontics involves—and is enhanced by—this remarkably useful material. In some cases, it’s part of necessary medical treatments: A cavity must be filled to prevent worse damage, and at least the plastic-glass composite filling your cavity won’t &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/mercury/mercury-dental-amalgam" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:leach mercury;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;leach mercury&lt;/a&gt;, like the silver fillings that were more common for prior generations. But in cases that are purely aesthetic—tooth straightening can fall into this category—the trade-offs may look different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/09/avoiding-microplastics-luxury/679939/?utm_source=yahoo-news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hands are wrung;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hands are wrung&lt;/a&gt; over the microplastics that pass from our tea bags and carpets and water bottles into our bodies, when it comes to oral health, we welcome plastic intentionally, and sometimes permanently, directly in our mouths. This troubles Adith Venugopal, an orthodontist and a senior lecturer in the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Otago, New Zealand; he published a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-024-7465-x" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:letter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; in a dental journal last year raising concerns about the micro- and nanoplastics that slough off aligners and retainers. A robust body of research links chemical compounds that leak out of plastic to hormone disruption, developmental abnormalities, and cancer, but the effect of the actual fragments of plastic accumulating in our &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/hsc-newsroom-post-microplastics-testicular" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tissues;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tissues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11100893/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:organs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;organs&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl2746" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less clear;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;less clear&lt;/a&gt;. Venugopal started researching microplastics in orthodontics after seeing a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:paper;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;paper &lt;/a&gt;that found patients with micro- and nanoplastics embedded in their artery plaques were more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. Plastic exposure from dentistry or orthodontics, Venugopal thinks, is ethically different than the worries over plastic exposure resulting from consumer choices. “Prescribing it from a medical standpoint, knowing that it would leach out and cause so many millions of particles to be ingested on a yearly basis, is troublesome, isn’t it?” he told me. “I mean, that’s the first thing, to do no harm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what the harm of dental and orthodontic plastics might be is, as of yet, poorly understood. Venugopal’s letter is one in a growing body of statements and studies coming out of those professions that ask if plastic may be harming patients. (“Microplastics: An Orthodontic Concern!” yelped an &lt;a href="https://www.jwfo.org/article/S2212-4438(24)00037-7/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:editorial;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the World Federation of Orthodontists&lt;/em&gt; last year.) So far, few if any papers have looked at the issue in humans, though preliminary studies &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ejo/article/47/3/cjaf014/8110795" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:attempt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;attempt&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969722084601" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:replicate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;replicate&lt;/a&gt; aspects of mouths in a lab, by simulating wear and tear from liquid and friction. The Nordic Institute of Dental Materials has been &lt;a href="https://www.niom.no/visiting-researcher-at-niom-investigating-microplastics-from-occlusal-device-materials.6716329-606094.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:looking into the release of microplastics from night guards;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;looking into the release of microplastics from night guards&lt;/a&gt;. The chief scientific officer of the American Dental Association’s research arm, Ben Wu, said in a statement that the association is “closely monitoring the scientific literature on microplastics” but that “no clinical evidence currently exists showing a meaningful oral or overall health impact from the particles.” The ADA’s best current advice to patients is to monitor their plastic dental devices for cracks, roughness, or breaks, and look into a replacement. Or, Wu suggested, instead of opting for clear plastic aligners, a person could get metal braces or retainers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Association of Orthodontists is taking a more proactive approach. “This is certainly something that is high in our consciousness,” Steven Siegel, the organization’s president, told me. The association recently convened a panel of researchers to look at all of the available studies to date, and has asked its awards committee to put out a call for proposals for new research in this area. It &lt;a href="https://www2.aaoinfo.org/aao-monitoring-research-regarding-microplastics-and-clear-aligners/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hasn’t taken an official position;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hasn’t taken an official position&lt;/a&gt; on microplastics, because the group, like Venugopal and the ADA, considers the available research to be “preliminary,” he said. But it believes microplastics are “an issue that we need to pay close attention to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clear orthodontic aligners have become a particular focus of early research attention, given the nature of their use. “They’re supposed to be worn about 22 hours a day for optimal tooth movement,” Venugopal told me. People typically change theirs out after one or two weeks and continue that cycle for months to years. A group of Italian researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969722084601" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a paper in 2023 that found that aligners did indeed leach microplastics after seven days when exposed to artificial saliva in a lab. But Venugopal points out that the lab study couldn’t capture the onslaught of enzymes, teeth gritting, and temperature variation that a real human mouth inflicts. So he and a doctoral student are now conducting what he believes is the first real-world study of how much microplastic leaches into saliva while an actual person is wearing aligners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is always the alternative that the ADA pointed to: metal braces. Although these may still use a small amount of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10981366/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plastic adhesive;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plastic adhesive&lt;/a&gt; to bond the equipment to the front of a wearer’s teeth, at least the plastic isn’t on the chewing surface. (This doesn’t elide concerns entirely; &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/envhealth.3c00051" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one paper;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one paper&lt;/a&gt; has tried to characterize the microplastics sloughed off by orthodontic rubber bands. It may be a lot.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his own practice, instead of prescribing plastic retainers, which can be removed, Venugopal says he’s intentionally prescribing more fixed-wire retainers for people who would get a similar benefit from either. (Some patients would still benefit more from having thermoplastic molded ones, he said. But for those who could go either way, they’re getting metal.) “So, yes, it is affecting me as a clinician as well,” he said. If a patient were to ask him about microplastics, he would tell them what research has shown (that microplastics leak from objects such as aligners) and what it hasn’t (whether the leakage from an aligner or retainer alone poses a significant danger). “Without being informed about that, I don’t want to scare patients,” he said. Each of his patients—like everyone—is already inhaling, drinking, and eating microplastics just by living in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to get us out of the dental-plastic loop will be to develop different materials. A plastic-bristled toothbrush may add approximately 30 to 120 microparticles of plastic to your diet with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749123021206" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:each brushing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;each brushing&lt;/a&gt;, according to one study. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026265X2502034X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Another;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Another&lt;/a&gt; put the estimate at an average of 39 particles a day. Either calculation suggests that a plastic toothbrush adds tens of thousands of particles to one’s yearly load of microplastics, which is significant when considering that &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.9b01517" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:estimates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; of microplastic exposure from food, air, and water put a person’s yearly particle load at more than 100,000. Nonplastic toothbrush options exist, but they’re hardly mainstream. Most dental floss is plastic, too—alternatives, such as silk floss, are mostly a health-food-store find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, not brushing your teeth would be a dental disaster, and no one should choose not to fill a cavity. The downside of an untreated cavity almost certainly far exceeds any hypothetical harm from additional microplastic exposure. “I was at a dental meeting a couple of months back, and I bit down and I fractured two molars, old fillings,” Siegel said. “And I went to my friend who’s an excellent dentist. I didn’t hesitate to have composite restorations with the materials that we use. I put it in that context: I think that the release, if any, of some of the compounds and microplastics is probably relatively minimal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for mouth guards: Siegel said he wasn’t aware of any material that could take the place of my acrylic set prescribed for tooth grinding. “Whether it’s crossing the street or having a medical procedure, one always looks at the risks and benefits,” Siegel told me. “I try and limit microplastic exposure in my own life. I try not to reheat things in plastic containers. I limit processed-food intake, things like that.” But, he said, when it comes to the health of your mouth, you want to ask yourself: Do the benefits of protecting your teeth and jaw outweigh the potential risks of adding to your microplastic dose? “For me personally, if I ground my teeth, I would wear a night guard,” he said. That was a sensible assessment, I thought, even if—for now—we don’t really have the information to base that decision on. Still, I got his point. I’ll pull mine out of storage tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/08/modern-dentistry-microplastic/683996/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Article originally published at The Atlantic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Article originally published at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 16:51:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE13WEx4cWxCZ1RfUDN2eEIwVTM4cVlDdEFQdUNEeHRuRVBqMk5kbHgtXzlUdXV5bEhRQ25JS0dHYWZhRXp5VzlrUEZNQ2NsZjZhOXQtMnEwelFydzYwbjl6MmFYU3hvelBrVDMxTklqZTdtTWw4TTVRMHZGZi0tVU0</guid></item><item><title>食肉细菌在佛罗里达州杀死第5人，感染激增至20例- WPEC</title><link>https://cbs12.com/news/local/flesh-eating-bacteria-kills-5th-person-in-florida-infections-surge-to-20-cases-in-weeks-oysters-seafood-florida-department-of-health-bacteria-seafood-infection-florida-august-25-2025</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.

The infections can be treated with antibiotics, but in serious cases, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapid diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and recovery, and those with strong immune systems are at low risk of developing serious complications, per officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to FDOH, the confirmed deaths in Florida have been reported in these counties:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bay County - two deaths.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broward County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hillsborough County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;St. Johns County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, confirmed cases have been reported in these counties:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collier County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dade County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Duval County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Escambia County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flagler&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lee County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manatee County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Martin County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Okaloosa County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;St. Johns County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Santa Rosa County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walton County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, FDOH reported that Florida had a total of 82 confirmed infections with 19 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio bacteria are responsible for approximately 80,000 illnesses each year in the United States. The CDC reports around 150 to 200 infections annually, with a mortality rate of about 20% among those infected, often leading to death within one to two days after symptoms arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find more ways to stay up to date with your latest local news. &lt;a href="https://cbs12.com/sign-up" target="_blank" title="https://cbs12.com/sign-up" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Sign up for our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to get the day's top headlines delivered right to your inbox. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CBS12NewsWPEC" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/@CBS12NewsWPEC" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Subscribe to our YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; for the biggest stories and can't miss video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSTM</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 16:49:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgJBVV95cUxOSzF1MUt0c1haSmhINlBPQnBJamM0aFA5WFFqVk1OdHhWczdjem82SHFkTlA4Rkc2WVREM2RDV0RxNk5SUDczTXZFc1hyTmh2dTE2V1ZGVGhCbEU0YW9ZV0h2bTR1RWl6eTNrclVRdUdSc3BCR3JXNEctS3ZZYzJDZ0NzSjAyVXRrWTBSM2xoMjhkeC1fdnpxREhZWXFCaE13dTZjOTdybkNiREp3Sm9USjFFZ0lqN2hrRVJJTno5ZWY4NDV1TDRWeHd5Zl9UQ2NBRDliaTk4SmZGMHdXNXRBOXBBWWd0VWdXeVk3NmVPNVk3U0YwQkxuSE1VYnNBWjlyVFVOM09VNE05NEd3Zm9zcHRDdDVUYVdUQl9rTmE5NE5LUVhJcXlqTGZlaFhxUUZFQ2hSZ0tMNi0wbDZLUlZuOU9kT242dw</guid></item><item><title>科学家进行首例猪-人肺移植-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/health/lung-transplant-pig-human.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 16:02:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE01QWNqbk9lWkt6cnozNHR2R245Si1KdFJGRm9YZmlvRjBYVG5oNGdtRlpxWm1kakM2UTFvQlNFa3g2MkU5SThBcXZ3Z3lRT0g0SHVEcmgzWDBwdkNUTEhjLVp2eXNDdVUxY1ZIU2Q4bG5QU21NSTFIZ1QzMzQ</guid></item><item><title>我在Mounjaro丢了9块石头，但被毁容的副作用击中-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15018207/stone-Mounjaro-effect-teeth-weight-loss-jabs-doctor.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Hope Lancaster Colquhoun was sent photos of her sister's wedding, where she was a bridesmaid, she should have been thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the 42-year-old, who lives in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, could hardly bear to open the file. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, the 'defeated' mum of one, who weighed around 18 stone, was filled with dread at how 'heavy' she would look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So when, months later, she was diagnosed with &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-616e8090-7ea9-11f0-8959-afc9205461e6"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, prescribed Mounjaro and instantly shed the pounds, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-2d71d720-7dea-11f0-9bd7-992ec2de9cd1" class=""&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; jab felt like a 'lifeline'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dropping nine stone and going from a size 22 to a size 8 in the space of just a year, she looked 'like a totally new person'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her weight, however, wasn't the only dramatic change she noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As I ran my tongue against the top of my mouth, I felt a sharp, jagged edge,' the influencer, who is originally from Texas in the US, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I looked in the mirror and was left horrified as not one, but multiple, of my teeth had completely snapped in half.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hope Lancaster Colquhoun (pictured with her husband Dean Colquhoun) had two rows of broken teeth after losing nine stone from taking a weight loss jab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hope Lancaster Colquhoun says she was nervous about looking at photos of herself at her sister's wedding and was filled with dread at how 'heavy' she would look&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a panic, she arranged an emergency appointment with a dentist who told her that at least seven of her teeth would have to be pulled out immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I sat in the chair, feeling sick to my stomach, as they yanked my natural teeth away,' she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My gnashers before were perfect and I was really proud of my natural smile. I never had any dental work and kept up with my dental hygiene more than most people I knew.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many on the jabs, Ms Lancaster Colquhoun had experienced side-effects including nausea and indigestion, but noticed no debilitating impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Doctors think it's because I've lost so much weight in such a short frame of time,' she explains.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 1.5 million patients in the UK are now paying for private Mounjaro prescriptions, as well as a similar drug called Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But increasingly, users are experiencing a surprising and distressing effect of what are known medically as GLP-1 drugs: tooth decay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Receding or sensitive gums, yellowing teeth, bad breath, gum disease and even tooth loss are among the distressing symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Months after starting on the jabs, Hope suddenly noticed her teeth were cracked. In a panic, she arranged an emergency appointment with a dentist who told her at least seven of her teeth would have to immediately be pulled out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mounjaro is a GLP-1 drug. Jab users have told how they have lost teeth and developed cavities and gum inflammation weeks after beginning the medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In online forums, jab users have also told how they lost teeth and developed cavities and gum inflammation weeks after beginning the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to dental experts, who have seen a rise in what they dub 'Ozempic teeth', this is in part the result of acid reflux caused by the injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The jabs make people feel full by slowing down the rate of digestion, which can lead to food remaining in the stomach for longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The longer it sits, the higher the risk of stomach acid &lt;span&gt;refluxing into the mouth - weakening and dissolving the enamel and making teeth more susceptible to decay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are medications including proton pump inhibitors (PPI), like omeprazole, that can be taken to relieve acid reflux, but these should not be taken regularly in the long term. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts have also suggested a lack of saliva, triggered by using the jabs, could be the culprit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Edward Li, principal dentist and co-founder at The a.b.c Smile in London, told the Daily Mail: 'GLP-1 drugs slow the emptying of the stomach, which can increase reflux and nausea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When acid repeatedly washes into the mouth, enamel is softened and gradually worn away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The 42-year-old lost a staggering nine stone for her own wedding day, using the weight loss drug Mounjaro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This can raise the risk of sensitivity and cavities, but on its own is unlikely to cause a tooth to be lost unless there were already significant dental problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A more likely explanation is dry mouth, or xerostomia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These drugs dampen appetite and often reduce the sensation of thirst. Patients commonly drink less water and produce less saliva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Saliva is vital for protecting teeth: it neutralises acid, carries minerals to repair early enamel damage, and contains immune defences against bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Without it, plaque builds up and gum disease can progress much faster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Reports of “Ozempic mouth” or “Ozempic teeth” are increasingly being seen in our clinic, reflecting this.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who lose teeth while taking drugs may also have had 'underlying gum disease, weakened enamel or a genetic predisposition', he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In such cases, the added stress of dry mouth or acid exposure may tip the balance, pushing already compromised teeth past the point of saving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Rapid changes in body weight, whether drug-induced or not, can have side-effects of their own. Nutritional gaps, especially in protein and minerals, may reduce the resilience of both bone and gum tissue. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This does not mean the injections directly cause tooth loss, but that the pace and physiology of weight loss may make pre-existing dental problems worse.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Equally, jab users may be more susceptible to dental issues because they're failing to eat a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Rizwan Mahmood, a private dentist at London clinic Ruh Dental, 'eating less can also mean fewer nutrients like calcium and vitamin D - essentials for healthy teeth and gums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're seeing more inflammation and gum issues in patients using these medications, especially if they're not eating a balanced diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also told the Daily Mail: 'GLP-1 patients&lt;span&gt; often opt for softer, more processed foods which, if not counterbalanced with good hygiene, can quickly lead to plaque build-up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While these medications are highly effective, they can inadvertently create conditions that harm oral health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14277797/Ultra-processed-food-blamed-flaw-childrens-development.html"&gt;has also suggested&lt;/a&gt; a diet high in soft and hyper-palatable processed foods may reduce facial muscle strength and trigger teeth issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But regularly chewing solid and fibrous foods exercises the jaw, helping to prevent &lt;span&gt;deficiencies in the size and shape of dental arches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So devastating is the impact of the crippling dental side-effect that one patient has even filed a lawsuit against Mounjaro manufacturer Eli Lilly and Ozempic manufacturer Novo Nordisk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Attorneys for Jaclyn Bjorklund, from Louisiana, who had used both injections, claimed she was diagnosed with a condition called gastroparesis after using the jabs, which caused her to vomit so much that some of her teeth fell out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others have taken to social media forums to share their concerns over their rapidly declining dental health while on the jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one Reddit thread with more than 149,000 users, a user wrote: 'In the last week I have developed a bad inflammation on my gums. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'On some teeth I feel like the gum is receding or shrinking because I can see and feel the tooth necks which look orange.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another said: 'Since starting my journey, I’ve lost 80 pounds in five months. Has anyone noticed that since starting you are more prone to tooth decay or cavities!? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’ve always had cavities every so often but I can count at least six right now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Ms Lancaster Colquhoun, the debilitating side-effect has seen her shell out more than £3,700 to fix her teeth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But despite now needing dentures for life, she insists that taking the weight loss jab has saved her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’d encourage people to consider the jab because of how life-changing it’s been for me,' she said.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Responding to Ms Lancaster Colquhoun's tale, Eli Lilly said: 'Patient safety is Lilly’s top priority, and we take any reports regarding patient safety extremely seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Regulatory agencies conduct extensive independent assessments of the benefits and risks of every new medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Lilly is committed to continually monitoring, evaluating and reporting safety data to ensure the latest information is available for regulators and prescribers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Until now, dementia diagnoses often rely on questionnaires to indicate problems with memory as well as MRI scans (pictured) to track loss of brain volume&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is also important to know the tell-tale signs of a brain tumour to help catch in its early stages &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now evidence of a potential increased risk of malignant brain tumours adds urgency to shift the focus from short-term recovery to lifelong vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This underscores the importance of long-term monitoring for anyone with a history of a traumatic brain injury.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers divided 75,000 adults who had suffered a traumatic brain injury into three categories: mild, moderate and severe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mild included concussion, while falls and car crashes came under moderate and severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other 75,000 study participants had no history of traumatic brain injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found 87 volunteers in the moderate or severe group developed brain tumours within three to five years of injury—far higher than the mild or control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sandro Marini, a neurologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and study co-author, added: 'While there is an increased risk of tumor from a traumatic brain injury, the overall risk remains low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Still, brain tumor is a devastating disease and often gets detected in later stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

There is much more work required and we are not on the dawn of an era of lung xenotransplantation using pig lungs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Xenotransplantation has become a hot area of research in recent years, with the heart, kidneys and liver among the organs that have been transplanted into humans from pigs. The latter are typically genetically modified by removing certain pig genes and inserting specific human genes, to reduce rejection of the organs by the recipient’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Studies are often initially carried out on brain dead human recipients before, in some cases, being used in living patients. While there have been only a handful of living recipients, many have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/01/pig-heart-transplant-faucette-dies" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;died within weeks or months&lt;/a&gt; of such surgery, albeit not necessarily from complications relating to the transplant. However, &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/health/xenotransplant-pig-kidney-patient" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;some with transplanted pig kidneys have survived&lt;/a&gt; with the organs still functioning several months after the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But experts say xenotransplantation using lungs is particularly tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Every breath you breathe in is bringing the external environment into the body,” said Fisher. This means the lungs need to be very capable of responding to attacks from pollution, infection and other sources. “So the immune system in the lung is very sensitive and very active, which means when you’re dealing with organ transplantation, where you know you don’t want the immune system to be very active, it poses extra challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03861-x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Writing in the journal Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers in China reported how they transplanted the left lung from a Chinese Bama Xiang donor pig with six genetic modifications into a 39-year-old brain dead male recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team found the lung remained viable and functional over a 216-hour period and did not trigger hyperacute rejection – a rapid, violent immune response by the recipient’s body. There were also no signs of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, 24 hours after transplantation the lung showed signs of fluid accumulation and damage, possibly initially due to transplant-related inflammation. And despite the recipient being given powerful immunosuppressive medication, the transplanted organ was progressively attacked by antibodies, resulting in significant damage over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The impact of the damage was likely underestimated [because] the human recipient still had one of their own lungs present and this would have compensated for the damaged porcine lung,” said Fisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Peter Friend, from the University of Oxford, said the results were complicated by the fact brain death itself causes an acute inflammatory state. “So some of what they are seeing may be a function of the brain dead status of the recipient,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers behind the work said the approach needed to be refined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Continued efforts are needed to optimise immunosuppressive regimens, refine genetic modifications, enhance lung preservation strategies and assess long-term graft function beyond the acute phase,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Friend said other approaches to increasing the availability of organs were being investigated, including remodelling donor organs using stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some research groups are also exploring the possibility of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/sep/07/humanised-kidneys-grown-inside-pigs-for-the-first-time" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;growing humanised organs inside pigs or sheep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fisher added that while xenotransplantation for lungs held promise, another promising avenue was to treat human donor lungs deemed to be unsuitable for transplantation so they could be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If we get that right, that’s something can be implemented within months, and certainly in years could be making very big differences,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPdWpUMnJpTmhGblh4ZnhBb0hZNzJwb2wzS05CRDBxOXUxY3Y0ZlRueVMzQ285Q0hmRmx5QUN3R3pmVU5fRFh3bVBDRGsxZ1lpaDJXYkZIQjRVdGhFc0tkWU1tc3BMSGI1V0hiYkM1ZEtfNkJkb0dud3VTQ3ZDazRnTG5VQWxaLU5UUm9xdk5RaDh3R2M4aF9DUi1aTDZiVm54eGR2b19GZHFlOFJweF91ZGRSbC1TdnVVcl9GU2M3eFc</guid></item><item><title>洞穴鱼是如何一次又一次失去眼睛的- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/how-the-cavefish-lost-its-eyes-again-and-again/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Riddle thinks these carotenoids may be another adaptation to suppress inflammation, which might be important in the wild, as cavefish are likely overeating whenever food arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies by Krishnan, Rohner, and colleagues published in 2020 and 2022 have found other adaptations that seem to help tamp down inflammation. Cavefish cells produce lower levels of certain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-020-1234-2"&gt;molecules called cytokines that promote inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.74539"&gt;lower levels of reactive oxygen species&lt;/a&gt; — tissue-damaging byproducts of the body’s metabolism that are often elevated in people with obesity or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krishnan is investigating this further, hoping to understand how the well-fed cavefish remain healthy. Rohner, meanwhile, is increasingly interested in how cavefish survive not just overeating, but long periods of starvation, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No waste&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more fundamental level, researchers still hope to figure out why the Mexican tetra evolved into cave forms while any number of other Mexican river fish that also regularly end up in caves did not. (Globally, there are more than 200 cave-adapted fish species, but species that also still have populations on the surface are quite rare.) “Presumably, there is something about the tetras’ genetic makeup that makes it easier for them to adapt,” says Riddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though cavefish are now well-established lab animals used in research and are easy to purchase for that purpose, preserving them in the wild will be important to safeguard the lessons they still hold for us. “There are hundreds of millions of the surface fish,” says Rohner, but cavefish populations are smaller and more vulnerable to pressures like pollution and people drawing water from caves during droughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Riddle’s students, David Perez Guerra, is now involved in a committee to support cavefish conservation. And researchers themselves are increasingly careful, too. “The tissues of the fish collected during our lab’s last field trip benefited nine different labs,” Riddle says. “We wasted nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
