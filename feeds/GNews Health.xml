&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧬 Scientists leverage &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; to rapidly create &lt;strong&gt;personalized immune therapies&lt;/strong&gt; for cancer treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⚗️ Innovative AI designs &lt;strong&gt;minibinder proteins&lt;/strong&gt; that train the immune system to target cancer cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔍 Virtual safety checks enhance therapy &lt;strong&gt;safety&lt;/strong&gt; by preventing attacks on healthy cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⏳ New method promises &lt;strong&gt;faster&lt;/strong&gt; and more &lt;strong&gt;precise&lt;/strong&gt; cancer treatments, transforming oncology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of cancer treatment is witnessing a revolutionary shift with the introduction of AI-driven methods to create personalized immune therapies rapidly. This groundbreaking approach utilizes artificial intelligence to design proteins that can effectively train the immune system to target cancer cells. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on finding natural immune matches—a process that can take years—this new technique accelerates the timeline significantly. Within just weeks, scientists can create synthetic proteins that direct immune cells to cancer targets, marking a significant advancement in cancer research and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Faster Way to Train the Immune System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; highlights a significant leap forward in cancer treatment. Researchers from the Technical University of Denmark and the Scripps Research Institute have developed an AI platform to target cancer proteins, such as NY-ESO-1. This protein, prevalent in numerous tumors, has been a focal point for activating immune responses. By leveraging AI, scientists designed a minibinder protein that attaches to the NY-ESO-1 structure, enhancing the immune system’s ability to recognize and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process involved inserting the AI-designed protein into immune cells, resulting in modified cells known as IMPAC-T cells. These cells demonstrated a robust capacity to identify and eliminate cancer cells marked by NY-ESO-1. The success of these laboratory experiments underscores the potential of AI in creating highly effective cancer-targeting therapies. As Kristoffer Haurum Johansen, a postdoctoral researcher involved in the study, noted, the AI-generated minibinders performed impressively well in laboratory settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fighting Cancer With Digital Blueprints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This innovative AI system extends beyond known cancer targets, offering a new avenue for precision medicine. Researchers tested the platform on a previously unmapped target from a metastatic melanoma patient. The system successfully generated minibinders for this novel target, demonstrating its potential to design therapies for previously untargetable cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XLwz0TcFeQ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/theyre-hijacking-nature-with-machines-this-quantum-gamble-in-denmark-fuels-global-tensions-over-microsofts-power-and-national-resistance/"&gt;“They’re Hijacking Nature with Machines”: This Quantum Gamble in Denmark Fuels Global Tensions Over Microsoft’s Power and National Resistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This capability represents a transformative step in cancer treatment, enabling the creation of therapies tailored to the unique cancer markers in each patient. By utilizing digital models, scientists can bypass the limitations of existing data and immune cell availability. According to Timothy P. Jenkins, associate professor at DTU, the platform essentially provides a new set of tools for the immune system, designing molecular keys to target cancer cells with remarkable speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smart Screening to Improve Safety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical aspect of developing new immune therapies is ensuring they do not inadvertently attack healthy cells. Cancer markers often resemble proteins found in normal tissues, posing a risk of severe side effects if therapies bind to the wrong targets. To mitigate this risk, the research team implemented a "virtual safety check."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Precision in cancer treatment is crucial,” said Sine Reker Hadrup, professor at DTU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/i-just-saw-impossible-scientists-prove-time-reflections-exist-leaving-experts-stunned-and-forcing-physics-to-rewrite-its-own-laws/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using computer simulations, the team tested each minibinder against a comprehensive range of pMHCs present on healthy cells. This preemptive screening allowed them to eliminate potentially harmful designs before reaching the lab testing phase. By predicting and ruling out cross-reactions during the design phase, researchers increased the likelihood of developing safe and effective therapies. This step is pivotal in ensuring the safe application of these treatments in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Bench to Bedside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the lab results are promising, the journey from research to clinical application requires careful navigation. Jenkins estimates that it will take approximately five years before initiating clinical trials in humans. Once these trials commence, the treatment protocol will likely resemble existing methods used for certain blood cancers, involving the collection and modification of a patient’s immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the new AI method promises to streamline and personalize the process. By utilizing digital tools to design a perfect match for each patient's tumor markers, the approach could revolutionize treatments for solid tumors, where current immune therapies have had limited success. This advancement paves the way for potentially treating cancers previously deemed untreatable and exploring rare or unique mutations overlooked by conventional therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5LVxn9Sbff"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/09/students-build-rocket-engine-in-9-months-swiss-undergraduates-create-revolutionary-3d-printer-that-fuses-two-different-metals-simultaneously-while-cutting-production-time-by-67-percent/"&gt;“Students Build Rocket Engine In 9 Months”: Swiss Undergraduates Create Revolutionary 3D Printer That Fuses Two Different Metals Simultaneously While Cutting Production Time By 67 Percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Era in Precision Oncology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capability to design cancer-targeting proteins from scratch marks a pivotal moment in immunotherapy. This breakthrough illustrates the feasibility of transitioning from a digital blueprint to a functional immune therapy within a matter of weeks. The synthetic minibinders developed by the research team function comparably to natural receptors, effectively guiding T cells to their targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tested in laboratory settings, these engineered immune cells demonstrated comparable efficacy to those created through traditional methods, yet with faster and safer development processes. With ongoing refinement, AI-powered approaches could make personalized cancer treatments more accessible, precise, and swiftly deliverable. The future of immunotherapy is evolving beyond biological understanding to include the design of solutions through digital innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the integration of AI in cancer treatment progresses, it raises important questions about the future of precision medicine. How will these advancements shape the landscape of oncology and patient care in the coming years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;paralyzed &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;hours later—because of a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;rare brain disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; that makes cells bleed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The boy, a little league MVP, lost his ability to walk, talk, and even breathe independently in 24 hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors then realized that the child had a cavernoma—a mulberry-like cluster of leaking cells near his brain stem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

walk again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;In another case, a pediatrician thought it was an earache &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block"

and this is because they have difficulty accurately explaining what they are experiencing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And so for little kids, when we get to a point where this becomes emergent, where there’s an emergency, what we see are things like vomiting, projectile vomiting, floppiness, so this loss of muscle tone in infants especially.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And it can be mistaken for something that’s not as severe.

It’s better to be safe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The folks who are having focal seizures, that’s not as much of an emergency.

from person to person. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And as harrowing and jarring as the effects may be, only two percent of diagnosed cases result in patients passing away

First off, the doctor needs to or the health care provider needs to believe you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When you’re having neurological symptoms, sometimes they get tossed off as psychiatric symptoms or get attributed to some other physical disease that’s happening. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And so it may take a while before you actually get to the point where the doctor will say, Oh, there’s something going on in your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/neurologist-issues-warning-about-popular-post-exercise-practice-it-could-trigger-a-stroke/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;brain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We should give you an MRI.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children and certain “populations” are not favored candidates for MRI’s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think particularly there are populations in our country (the US) that don’t get the benefit of the doubt in the same way as others,” Lee observed, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and those folks typically take longer to get a diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A second issue that gets in the way of diagnosis is with kids,” she continued.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/polygraph-parents-two-young-children-who-suddenly-vanished-revealed/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; need to be sedated in order to have an MRI. MRI requires you to lie still for twenty five minutes or more, and children just can’t sustain that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So the sedation itself is a big deal. It requires time in pre op, in the MRI, and then in a recovery area.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Witten Daniel is home and well, and planning his return to the baseball field&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_2" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a testimony to Lee’s assertions of the low mortality rate surrounding Cavernous Malformation, her daughter and Witten Daniel have made the next best thing to full recoveries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Daniel’s case, it was Casey’s refusal to accept her &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/mom-left-puzzled-after-toddler-complains-of-hearing-ultrasound-photo-too-loud/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;son&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s fate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Following a Google search, she connected with neurosurgeons Dr. Manish Shah and Dr. Jacques Morcos at Houston’s UTHealth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a result of this interaction, her son, now seven, is home again, preparing to return to the baseball field, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kcbd.com/2025/09/12/lubbock-mother-says-google-search-saved-her-sons-life/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;per&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;KCBD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It appears the internet rallied behind Witten Daniels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_3" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div id="postPoll-9370777" class="post-poll poll-wrapper single-post" data-poll-viewed="false" data-post-id="9370777" data-main-post-id="" data-poll-id="16907"&gt; &lt;input class="post-9370777-poll-value" type="hidden" value="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"&gt; &lt;div data-bind="if: isInitialised()"&gt;    &lt;div data-bind="if: !isLoading() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isShowingResults"&gt; &lt;div class="poll-content"&gt; &lt;h3 class="answered-content-title"&gt;Thanks!

                    &lt;p&gt;Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#"&gt;half of all Americans have high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; – a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410"&gt;condition called hypertension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypertension is the No. 1 risk factor for heart disease and stroke. In addition, hypertension increases risk of dementia and cognitive decline. Heart disease, stroke and dementia are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm#"&gt;first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. Unfortunately, only 1 in 4 people with a history of high blood pressure have this condition under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2025, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, based on a comprehensive analysis of literature published over the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conversation U.S. asked &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24559"&gt;cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain what the new guidelines mean and how you can work with your doctor to manage your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the primary takeaways of the new guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065"&gt;prior to this new statement were in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, the medical community has learned a lot about hypertension and the best way to control it. The new guidelines provide a great deal of new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/heart-disease-patients-should-get-vaccinated-against-respiratory-illnesses-including-covid-19-cardiology-experts-say"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Heart disease patients should get vaccinated against respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, cardiology experts say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the definition of hypertension has changed. The criteria are more strict, and the target blood pressures are lower than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criteria depend on the values of the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/which-blood-pressure-number-is-important"&gt;“systolic” and the “diastolic” pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Systolic blood pressure, the top number, represents the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is squeezing blood into the body. Diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number, is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing. Both numbers are important when determining the severity of hypertension and how it is most appropriately managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines have removed the category of “prehypertension,” which was defined by a systolic pressure of 120-139 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), or a diastolic pressure of 80-99 mm Hg. Now, patients are categorized as having “elevated blood pressure” if their blood pressure is 120-129 over less than 80 mm Hg, or stage 1 hypertension if they are 130-139/80-89.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/should-you-eat-more-red-meat"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Should you eat more red meat?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading of 140/90 or more is considered stage 2 hypertension, and a reading of 180/120 or greater is a hypertensive crisis. In essence, the bar has been lowered, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25466"&gt;this change may impact millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People need to ask their doctors if they have hypertension based on these new criteria and whether or not they should be treated. It is also very important for patients to get advice from their doctors about lifestyle habits that they can incorporate into their daily routine, like diet, exercise and healthy sleep habits to help lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the guidelines encourage providers to use a risk calculator, called PREVENT – short for &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS&lt;/a&gt; – to determine a patient’s overall risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure. This tool represents a significant advance in personalizing medical care, since it incorporates risk factors unique to the individual, allowing for a tailored approach to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the link between alcohol intake and high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines encourage people to limit alcohol intake because alcohol increases blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis of seven studies with nearly 20,000 people showed that systolic blood pressure will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224"&gt;increase by about 1mmHg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed&lt;/a&gt;. A standard beer contains about 14 grams of alcohol, so regular alcohol consumption may increase blood pressure by several points over time. For people who have been drinking an excessive amount of alcohol but stop, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.HYP.33.2.653"&gt;their blood pressure may come back down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; Study: Lower targets for blood pressure can prevent heart attacks and strokes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might not sound like much, but when combined with other unhealthy and risky behaviors, like sedentary behavior, excessive weight, inadequate sleep, psychological stress and smoking, the risk factors start to add up quickly. Together, they can very quickly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001303"&gt;increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines encourage patients to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption entirely compared with the old guidelines. For people who do want to drink alcohol, the new guidelines recommend that men should drink no more than two drinks per day, and women should drink no more than one drink per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What other lifestyle factors did the new report focus on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize the fact that diet can have a major impact on blood pressure. They recommend that all adults – with or without hypertension – consume less than 2,300 milligrams of salt, or approximately 1 teaspoon, per day, and more ideally, less than 1,500 milligrams per day. For a comparison, the average &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html"&gt;American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt&lt;/a&gt; per day. Patients may also consider potassium-based salt substitutes to further lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/low-income-explains-poorer-survival-after-a-heart-attack-more-than-race-study-finds"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Low income explains poorer survival after a heart attack more than race, study finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend a specific diet called the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, for patients with or without hypertension to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat or nonfat dairy and whole grains. This diet may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;lead to a reduction in blood pressure by up about 10 mm Hg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also emphasize the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;need to increase physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. On average, for every additional 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a person gets per week, systolic blood pressure decreases by 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure drops by 1 mm Hg, with the largest reduction occurring at 150 minutes of dynamic exercise per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise also helps you live longer and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/as-wrestling-fans-reel-from-the-sudden-death-of-hulk-hogan-a-cardiologist-explains-how-to-live-long-and-healthy-and-avoid-chronic-disease-262103"&gt;reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the main preventive strategies in the report?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PREVENT risk calculator that the new guidelines recommend incorporates several factors, including demographics, cholesterol levels, medical history and blood pressure, to determine risk. This risk calculator is &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;free and available online&lt;/a&gt; to the general public. The PREVENT calculator may be a helpful tool for all Americans since it reliably provides patients and providers with an assessment of overall risk assessment. But it is particularly helpful for people with multiple chronic conditions, like hypertension, high cholesterol, overweight/obesity or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/an-annotated-page-from-heart"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; An annotated page from ‘Heart’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association recommends &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8"&gt;eight essential health behaviors&lt;/a&gt; for controlling blood pressure and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease overall. These include healthy diet, regular exercise, stopping or avoiding smoking, sleeping seven to nine hours per night, and controlling weight, cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the new guidelines change how doctors address high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest advances with these new guidelines is the personalized approach to medical care through the use of the PREVENT calculator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend that doctors encourage their patients to check blood pressure at home to better understand the fluctuations in pressure that occur throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the guidelines encourage physicians to be more aggressive about treating blood pressure. This may be an important change since uncontrolled blood pressure is a major risk factor for eventual development of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

Then, earlier this month, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), released the "Make Our Children Healthy Again" report. Among the ways the &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/make-our-children-healthy-again-maha-report-2025-11807251" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:20-page report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;20-page report&lt;/a&gt; could reshape the nation’s food policy is a push to deregulate food, with the HHS, FDA, and USDA planning to remove “restrictions on whole milk sales in schools, allowing districts to offer full-fat dairy options alongside reduced-fat alternatives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. has a questionable track record on milk — he says he only drinks raw milk, despite repeated agreement among experts that it’s nutritionally equivalent to but poses much greater health risks than pasteurized milk. So is it wise to trust his gut in this case? Is whole milk actually a nutritious drink that should be reintroduced to schools for the sake of kids’ well-being?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is whole milk — and how does it differ from other types?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whole milk might sound indulgent, but nutritionally, it’s not so different from the lower-fat options you see on the shelf,” says &lt;a href="https://www.usdairy.com/about-us/national-dairy-council/leadership/ndc-leadership" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Katie Brown, EdD, RDN, FAND, FASN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Katie Brown, EdD, RDN, FAND, FASN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian, executive vice president of Dairy Management Inc., and president of the National Dairy Council. The main difference is the amount of fat and calories, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eight-ounce glass of &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/746782/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:whole milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;whole milk&lt;/a&gt;, also known as full-fat milk, contains 152 calories and eight grams of total fat, whereas the equivalent portion of &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/746778/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2% milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2% milk&lt;/a&gt; holds 122 calories and four grams of total fat, &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/746772/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1% milk ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;1% milk &lt;/a&gt;provides 106 calories and two grams of total fat, and &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/746776/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:skim milk has;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;skim milk has&lt;/a&gt; 84 calories and zero grams of fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/what-do-milk-fat-percentages-mean-8724862" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Here’s the Actual Difference Between Whole, Low-fat, and Nonfat Milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Here’s the Actual Difference Between Whole, Low-fat, and Nonfat Milk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These differences in fat and calorie content are solely due to processing. “All of the milk fat is removed from dairy milk, then added back into the milk in varying amounts before the milk is bottled,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.laurentwiggenutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Twigge, MCN, RDN, LD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Twigge, MCN, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and owner of Lauren Twigge Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole milk, also known as full-fat milk, has more fat added back in than other types of milk — approximately 3.25% according to the USDA, roughly the same as the natural fat content of unprocessed cow milk. This fat adds flavor to whole milk and gives it a creamier texture compared to other types — so what’s the downside?

Saunders, DO, IFMCP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Tyler J. Saunders, DO, IFMCP&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internal medicine physician focused on longevity and preventive medicine. Among other concerns, a diet high in saturated fat could lead to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging research suggests that whole milk may not pose the cardiovascular risks once feared, though. A 2025 study in &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165%2825%2900137-6/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found no significant differences in cardiovascular risk factors between people who drink full-fat and low-fat milk. The researchers concluded that cutting back on ultra-processed, nutrient-poor foods might be more important for heart health than whether you choose whole or skim milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Saunders concurs. “While high levels of saturated fat in the context of processed foods may be concerning, saturated fats from whole foods like dairy do not appear to cause heart disease,” he says. This shift in understanding has influenced modern dietary fat recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is milk good for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk, including whole milk, provides a complete, high-quality protein and other nutrients that help keep you full, support energy, and assist in muscle repair, says &lt;a href="https://thesolutionissleep.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Angela Holliday-Bell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Angela Holliday-Bell&lt;/a&gt;, the board-certified physician and clinical sleep specialist behind The Solution Is Sleep. Those are all good things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For children, these benefits are especially important. “In the first 1,000 days of life — spanning from conception to two years of age — rapid brain growth depends on key nutrients. Dairy milk provides seven of the 14 nutrients identified by the &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/141/2/e20173716/38085/Advocacy-for-Improving-Nutrition-in-the-First-1000?autologincheck=redirected" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Academy of Pediatrics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; as essential for early brain development, such as protein, iodine, zinc, choline, vitamin B12, selenium, and vitamin A,” Dr. Holliday-Bell explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/goat-milk-anti-aging-muscle-benefits-study-11784847" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientists Tested 4 Types of Milk — This One Stood Out for Muscle and Gut Health Benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scientists Tested 4 Types of Milk — This One Stood Out for Muscle and Gut Health Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk naturally contains electrolytes, making it a surprisingly effective hydration choice. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26702122/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; even shows that milk can be more hydrating than water or sports drinks due to its balance of protein, carbohydrates, and electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy milk is also budget-friendly. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6842517/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMilk%20and%20dairy%E2%80%9D%20were%20the,least%20expensive%20sources%20of%20choline." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows dairy products are the least expensive sources of calcium and vitamin D in the American diet, costing about 25 cents per eight-ounce glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is whole milk even better for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to milk’s other nutritional benefits, whole milk may promote satiety, support weight management, and enhance metabolic health, says Dr. Holliday-Bell, as the combination of fat and protein helps you feel full longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies in children suggest those who drink whole milk have lower odds of being overweight compared with reduced-fat milk drinkers, and large cohort studies in adults have linked higher dairy-fat intake to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twiggs notes that regular consumption of whole milk within the context of a calorie-controlled diet may support weight management in children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much whole milk can I drink?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because experts are reassessing whole milk’s nutritional value, doesn’t mean they’re now recommending unchecked consumption; they still emphasize moderation and quality. &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/harpreet-pall/1316806" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harpreet Pall, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Harpreet Pall, MD&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical officer and pediatric gastroenterologist at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Hospital and K. Hovnanian Children’s Hospital in Neptune, New Jersey, recommends plain, pasteurized dairy milk without added sweeteners or flavorings. He mentions that if a child is overweight, their pediatrician might adjust milk recommendations on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/dairy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;, total daily dairy intake recommendations are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toddlers (12 to 23 months):&lt;/strong&gt; 1 2/3 to 2 cups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children (2 to 3 years):&lt;/strong&gt; 2 to 2 1/2 cups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children (4 to 8 years):&lt;/strong&gt; 2 1/2 cups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kids (9 years and older) and adults:&lt;/strong&gt; 3 cups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the Dietary Guidelines do not specify an exact amount of milk to include in your diet but instead focus on the broader dairy group, which includes milk, yogurt, and cheese. This group, however, excludes “foods made from milk that have little calcium and a high fat content,” such as butter, cream cheese, and sour cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For toddlers and young children, Brown recommends offering milk with meals and water in between. Drinking too much milk can crowd out other nutrient-rich foods, especially those high in iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does whole milk compare to plant-based milks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant-based alternatives to dairy milk, like almond or oat milk, differ nutritionally. Most contain only one to two grams of incomplete protein per cup, missing essential amino acids. These plant-based options also often have lengthy ingredient lists, while dairy milk remains simple — just milk, often fortified with vitamin A and D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even when [plant-based milk is] fortified, the nutrient bioavailability may differ from that of natural dairy,” explains Dr. Saunders. According to Dr. Pall, the addition of sweeteners in plant-based milks, especially those for children, can also offset nutritional gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line on whole milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy milk of any type provides high-quality protein and 12 other essential nutrients, so experts say it’s a good choice for kids and adults in moderation. Whole milk might even provide additional benefits thanks to the very fat that once made it a pariah among health professionals, so don’t be dismayed if you see the creamy drink on your kids’ lunch menus. Although RFK Jr. may not have expert support on raw milk, the science is on his side when it comes to whole milk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/whole-milk-nutrition-11809651" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food &amp;amp; Wine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 12:07:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxORXd1Tl91YTN0YnJYazdTT0hsUnVpa19OeHZncUhwMUpMS0dfRUxrU1daRktKQklLQ3Bhb0pfai0xU001SWJ1MGdrck9VLTdMQm1vRGpadnNKVjRUd0t3bVlwSkpPQzZBMjFmdTFOZWRCTVdEU1psUUxlSU1KejlmX2RB</guid></item><item><title>加强骨骼的新突破可以逆转骨质疏松症- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-to-strengthen-bones-could-reverse-osteoporosis</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A new study points to a key bone-strengthening mechanism at work in the body, which could be targeted to treat the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968"&gt;bone-weakening disease, osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by researchers from the University of Leipzig in Germany and Shandong University in China, identified the cell receptor GPR133 (also known as ADGRD1) as being crucial to bone density, via bone-building cells &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoblast"&gt;called osteoblasts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variations in the &lt;em&gt;GPR133&lt;/em&gt; gene had previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108145"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to bone density, leading researchers to turn their attention to the protein it encoded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-took-mice-into-space-and-it-did-something-scary-to-their-bones"&gt;NASA Took Mice Into Space, And It Did Something Scary to Their Bones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team ran tests on mice in which the gene was either absent or could be activated using a chemical called AP503. In the absence of the &lt;em&gt;GPR133&lt;/em&gt; gene, the mice grew up with weak bones, resembling the symptoms &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/osteoporosis-is-a-silent-killer-heres-how-to-avoid-it"&gt;of osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;. However, when the receptor was present and activated by AP503, bone production and strength improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Using the substance AP503, which was only recently identified via a computer-assisted screen as a stimulator of GPR133, we were able to significantly increase bone strength in both healthy and osteoporotic mice," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; University of Leipzig biochemist Ines Liebscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174316" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174316" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram.jpg" alt="Bone diagram" class="wp-image-174316 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram-633x415.jpg 633w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174316" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;With GPR133 activated (on the left), the osteoblasts (orange) are more dominant. (&lt;span&gt;Biorender, Ines Liebscher&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these experiments, AP503 serves as a biological button that gets the osteoblasts working harder. The researchers were also able to show that it could work in tandem &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-can-provide-relief-for-backpain-if-you-do-it-safely"&gt;with exercise&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen bones even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the GPR133 cell receptor is a crucial link in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/green-spaces-may-have-a-powerful-effect-on-the-bones-of-children"&gt;keeping mice bones strong&lt;/a&gt; is an important finding. While the results are based on an animal model, the underlying processes are likely similar in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this receptor is impaired by genetic changes, mice show signs of loss of bone density at an early age – similar to osteoporosis in humans," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Liebscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say future treatments could be used to strengthen bones that are already healthy, and build degraded bone back up to full strength, as in cases of osteoporosis in women who are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/menopause-symptoms-may-be-early-warning-sign-of-dementia-study-shows"&gt;going through menopause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are actually &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-new-hormone-that-makes-super-strong-bones"&gt;numerous factors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that have an influence on bone strength, and that gives scientists plenty of scope for finding methods &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-bones-could-soon-heal-a-whole-lot-better-thanks-to-polymer-nanoshells"&gt;that ward off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; issues like osteoporosis and promote a healthier old age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis is a serious condition affecting millions worldwide. While available treatments can &lt;a href="https://theros.org.uk/information-and-support/osteoporosis/treatment/"&gt;slow the condition's progress&lt;/a&gt;, there's no way to reverse or cure the condition. Current treatments also tend to come with risky side effects (like an increased risk of other diseases) or become less effective over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The newly demonstrated parallel strengthening of bone once again highlights the great potential this receptor holds for medical applications in an aging population," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Juliane Lehmann, from the University of Leipzig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-025-02291-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND what Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is really doing as secretary of health and human services—and the danger to which he’s likely exposing the American public—look back at what happened over three remarkable days last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Start with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/16/cdc-turmoil-senate-testimony-susan-monarez-debra-houry/" rel&gt;Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, when the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee heard testimony from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/public-health/fired-cdc-director-describes-pressure-kennedy-over-vaccines" rel&gt;Susan Monarez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the former CDC director whom Kennedy forced out of her job just weeks after she had started. It was Monarez’s first public appearance since the firing, and she had a lot to say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/09/03/robert-kennedy-cdc-health-policy/" rel&gt;Debra Houry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a veteran physician and administrator who resigned as CDC medical director in protest of Kennedy’s policies, Monarez described the ways she said Kennedy was sidelining or firing anybody who might object to his &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/rfk-jr-s-history-of-medical-misinformation-raises-concerns-over-hhs-nomination/" rel&gt;widely discredited ideas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/08/scicheck-factchecking-robert-f-kennedy-jr/" rel&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. That included, she said, the time Kennedy demanded she preemptively endorse changes in vaccine recommendations for children—a demand she says she refused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was fired for holding the line on scientific integrity,” Monarez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That was just a warmup for Thursday and Friday, when the CDC’s official &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2025/aug/advisory-committee-immunization-practices-what-it-does" rel&gt;advisory committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on immunization met to consider some of those aforementioned vaccine-recommendation changes. The committee was full of Kennedy appointees he’d put there after &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/adult-non-flu-vaccines/kennedy-removes-all-acip-members-eyes-replacements" rel&gt;firing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the scientists who had been on the panel before. And the proceedings unfolded about how you’d expect, with familiar, scientifically questionable &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/aap-continues-to-support-access-to-routine-immunizations-for-every-child-in-every-community/" rel&gt;assertions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; about alleged vaccine harms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the meeting also stood out for its disarray. One particularly memorable sequence started at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/health/kennedy-cdc-vaccine-meeting-hepatitis-covid.html" rel&gt;end of Thursday’s session&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, when the panel prepared to vote on a resolution that would affect availability of the MMRV shot, which combines immunization for varicella (chickenpox) with immunization for measles, mumps, and rubella.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The resolution’s wording and meaning were unclear, as one panelist protested openly. The panel approved it anyway, only to hold a new vote—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546769/cdc-vaccine-acip-hepatitis-b-covid" rel&gt;and reverse the decision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—at the start of Friday’s session, evidently because several other panelists had also been confused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We are rookies,” chairman Martin Kulldorff acknowledged in his opening remarks Friday—which perhaps understated things, given that five of the twelve members hadn’t even been named until &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/15/health/cdc-acip-new-members" rel&gt;four days before&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-prescription-pure-chaos-vaccines-cdc-monarez-acip?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-prescription-pure-chaos-vaccines-cdc-monarez-acip?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upshot of that MMRV debate is that few children are likely to get the combined shot anymore. And while that’s not earth-shattering, because most kids already get two separate shots anyway, the decision along with the rest of the week’s developments were the clearest sign yet of Kennedy’s true intentions. Although he insists he is not anti-vax—that he simply wants to promote choice, and to uphold “gold-standard science”—he keeps finding ways to make vaccines less accessible and, in so doing, to reduce vaccination rates overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But last week showcased another, equally important side of Kennedy’s management: the way he is eliminating the people and dispensing with the procedures that allow agencies like the CDC to carry out their basic functions in a transparent, scientifically sound way. The effect isn’t so much to realign priorities as it is to unleash chaos. But that can still be corrosive to the government’s credibility—and hazardous to the people who depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;STRICTLY SPEAKING, little of what Monarez said on Wednesday was new. The basic outlines of her saga as she remembers it—that she’d refused to fall in line with Kennedy’s vaccine directives and refused to fire career scientists like Houry—were already out there, thanks to news reporting and a short &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-the-cdc-and-me-b4ca2eaa?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhEEjlmeI8DFQL2-DH9Tprr6Q34Us0cAI1w5es45XlBQcgYNlvnskxqbHtS2Yo%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=68cdda4f&amp;amp;gaa_sig=UAa3AdLNu4tfcAOlK-n2-jvGfk4j_mcwdxxa-SdI-mPoFU9IU9jiuVCa5pa11DnGMmz-jmEi-dG4U3H5JpLSMQ%3D%3D" rel&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Monarez had written for the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; a week before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the versions of the stories that Monarez and Houry told over the course of their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25vDjs0iy_k" rel&gt;nearly three-hour testimony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; were more detailed and vivid. Together, they painted a picture of a temperamental, controlling, and downright ignorant cabinet secretary that at any other time—and in any other administration—would have created a political firestorm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the Texas measles outbreak, Monarez said, neither she nor any of the career CDC scientists briefed Kennedy—something highly unusual for any outbreak, let alone one that had resulted in the first child measles deaths in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/child-dies-of-measles-heres-a-look-at-the-countrys-re-emerging-disease" rel&gt;decades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But the outbreak still kept her busy, in part because Kennedy was putting out so many false statements about vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He said things like ‘vaccines had fetal parts,’” Monarez said, “and I had to send a note to our leadership team to correct that misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fealty to Kennedy was also an issue: Monarez said that she was instructed to communicate about sensitive matters only with his political appointees, not career officials. In addition, she said, she was admonished not to communicate directly with members of the Senate HELP committee, who have oversight responsibility over the CDC and to whom she’d gone with some of her concerns about Kennedy’s decision-making.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most difficult moments, Monarez said, were when Kennedy disparaged CDC staff: “He called . . . CDC the most corrupt federal agency in the world, emphasized that CDC employees were horrible people. . . . He said that CDC employees were killing children and they don’t care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of that was a prelude to Monarez’s confrontation with Kennedy over changes to children’s vaccine recommendations, which he said would be coming in September. In her recollection, Kennedy wanted a promise that she’d endorse whatever the advisory committee recommended—a promise that she felt would &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/scientific-integrity/php/about/index.html" rel&gt;violate her duty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to evaluate such recommendations on the merits, and that she says she would not make.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;“He was very upset,” Monarez said. “The entire meeting was very tense. He was very upset throughout the entirety of our discussion, and it was not a productive exchange of information.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Monarez was composed throughout the hearing, even as GOP senators tried to paint her as a partisan operative out to make Donald Trump look bad. (Mind you, these senators were part of the unanimous Republican vote to confirm Monarez two months earlier after her nomination by Trump.) At one point, Oklahoma Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/gop-senator-fact-checked-on-live" rel&gt;said he had a recording&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that showed Monarez was lying about a key conversation she’d had with Kennedy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She stood her ground, and Mullin later withdrew the allegation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That doesn’t mean everything she and Houry said happened exactly as they recounted it. Even the most honorable witnesses can misremember things. But the stories they told about Kennedy line up well with his public record of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/" rel&gt;downplaying the Texas outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, spreading &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" rel&gt;false information about vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-cdc-fascism-abuse-catholic-church-autism-conferences-rcna181605" rel&gt;attacking the CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—not to mention the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/4-major-moments-from-rfk-jr-s-contentious-hearing-with-senators" rel&gt;agitated, angry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; persona that was on display when he testified before another Senate committee two weeks ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if that evidence alone doesn’t back up Monarez’s version of events, what unfolded in the advisory meetings Thursday and Friday sure did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share The Bulwark","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share The Bulwark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEETINGS OF THE Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (that’s the official title) are typically sleepy, technical affairs, and pretty well orchestrated too. That’s not to say outcomes are preordained, or that they can’t be contentious. But the tone and pace is typically more academic than antagonistic. Following procedural rules is a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s difficult to capture all the ways in which last week’s meeting deviated from those norms, because it was so full of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/20/acip-vaccine-cdc-criticism-rfk/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel&gt;bizarre moments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—like the time on Friday morning when an open mic caught somebody saying “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/ddiamond/status/1969041100259070315" rel&gt;you’re an idiot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” while committee member and MIT professor &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/retsef-levi" rel&gt;Retsef Levi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; was speaking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7anl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eceba06-9f28-4a2e-ba8a-6960b916e5d6_3000x2000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;At the meeting of the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on September 19, 2025. Retsef Levi (center) is speaking; chairman Martin Kulldorff is at left. (Photo by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But decorum wasn’t the meeting’s only casualty. Intellectual integrity took a blow too. The committee’s usual process for taking up a new proposal is to announce that it will be on the agenda weeks, if not months, before a meeting—and then assign working groups, staffed by CDC scientists, who can carefully study the available research before making presentations to the full committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequently presentations won’t even lead to immediate votes, with the committee instead deciding to continue deliberating—and, perhaps, getting more input from the working groups. The process is methodical by design, because the idea is to make sure the committee members are working from research that has gone through a rigorous review, from analysts with deep expertise—and that they’ll have enough time to thoroughly understand the science and the stakes, and to think through changes before making them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last week’s meeting didn’t work like that at all. Scientists from the agency’s vaccine center “were completely shut out” of the preparations, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/19/what-acip-meeting-says-about-vaccine-schedule-rfk-restoring-trust-vaccines/" rel&gt;STAT News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The resolutions up for debate were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/sarahdespres/status/1969079192642867403" rel&gt;not posted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in advance of the meeting, nor were presentations that—as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1969102133204304070" rel&gt;observers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the proceedings &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dimitridrekonja.bsky.social/post/3lz7g4epw2s2s" rel&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—included papers that had not gone through peer review, and leaned on unproven claims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The result was a series of unsubstantiated, ill-informed statements—like the time one panelist asked about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/doritmi/status/1968688874181345480" rel&gt;adjuvants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a vaccine that doesn’t contain them, or moments when panelists seemed not to understand their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/doritmi/status/1969392543407489062?s=46&amp;amp;t=d31mFctLAT5rZfNqxj5LTQ" rel&gt;authority&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—that had &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Atul_Gawande/status/1969034028104691920?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" rel&gt;prominent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dimitridrekonja.bsky.social/post/3lz77e76phs25" rel&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/krutikakuppalli/status/1969136431164497981?s=46&amp;amp;t=d31mFctLAT5rZfNqxj5LTQ" rel&gt;from&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/jsm2334/status/1969035464498676098" rel&gt;around&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/benmazer/status/1969083924430086649?s=46&amp;amp;t=d31mFctLAT5rZfNqxj5LTQ" rel&gt;the&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/crabb_vicki/status/1969129111420272889" rel&gt;country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1969152356269822029" rel&gt;aghast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Among them was Stanley Plotkin, who &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/history/stanley-plotkin-md/overview" rel&gt;developed the rubella vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the 1960s and is the author of the field’s standard textbook, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotkin%27s_Vaccines" rel&gt;Plotkin’s Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. After watching the proceedings, he wrote an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/retsefl/status/1969216390310551964" rel&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to Levi stating, “Please consider whether your grasp of immunology and public health is sufficient to make recommendations that will result in more disease. Modesty about your basic knowledge would help.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More knowledge about the realities of American &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/sick-jonathan-cohn?variant=32130588508194" rel&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250270931/thetenyearwar/" rel&gt;care&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; might have helped too—especially a debate about the timing of vaccines for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-kennedy-acip-crusade-against-vaccines-hepatitis-b" rel&gt;hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a potentially lethal disease newborns can acquire from their mothers during birth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC since 1991 has recommended administering the first dose before infants leave the hospital. A proposal before the committee last week called for pushing the first dose to one month, when doctors know a woman has tested negative for hep B during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The proposal’s proponents noted that most Western and Northern European countries have a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/humanspective/status/1968872290302755190?s=46&amp;amp;t=d31mFctLAT5rZfNqxj5LTQ" rel&gt;similar standard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. They did not acknowledge—and maybe did not grasp—that the situations are not comparable because those countries have seamless universal health care systems that consistently provide prenatal care and feature up-to-date, easily shareable medical records.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the patchwork U.S. health care system, with its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/surveys/2024/nov/state-health-insurance-coverage-us-2024-biennial-survey" rel&gt;inconsistent access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health-care/2017/10/30/16228054/american-medical-system-fax-machines-why" rel&gt;archaic recordkeeping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, selective recommendation is bound to miss a lot of cases—and in fact already did once, during the early years of the vaccine. Back then, roughly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/sep/17/hepatitis-b-vaccine-babies-risk/" rel&gt;20,000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; kids a year were getting hep B. It’s the main reason CDC switched to an at-birth dose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One panelist, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/faculty/facultydb/view.php/?uid=8272" rel&gt;Cody Meissner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, pointed this out repeatedly during the debate. He was a vocal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/16/health/vaccines-rfk-jr-cdc-fda.html" rel&gt;critic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of CDC vaccine recommendations during the pandemic—which, almost certainly, is how he ended up on the panel now. But he’s also a well-respected pediatrician who tried to convey some practical realities to his fellow panelists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The committee ultimately balked on hep B, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/acip-tables-vote-delay-hepatitis-b-vaccine-birth-dose" rel&gt;postponing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a decision until an unspecified future date—and setting off furious speculation over what behind-the-scenes drama might have prompted the shift.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-prescription-pure-chaos-vaccines-cdc-monarez-acip?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-prescription-pure-chaos-vaccines-cdc-monarez-acip?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WERE PANELISTS GETTING PRESSURE from the White House, which may have worried a hep B change would spark a political backlash? Were they responding to Senate HELP Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who is also a physician specializing in liver disease—and who had &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5508009-bill-cassidy-warning-hep-b-childhood-vaccine-delay/" rel&gt;said loudly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; he thinks changing the guidance would be a mistake?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or were some members with more anti-vax leanings unhappy that the proposal called for pushing back the first dose recommendation by only one month, when they think it should be later—and even more contingent on the identification of risk factors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any and all of those explanations are plausible, although there’s another interpretation too. Maybe some committee members zeroed in on more reliable evidence, listened to warnings from the likes of Meissner, and decided that changing the guidelines was a bad idea—or, at least, one that needed further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would be a hopeful sign, because that kind of process could actually be productive. Questioning groupthink, seeking out unconventional perspectives, holding past decisions up to serious scrutiny—that’s entirely appropriate, and ultimately makes agencies like CDC more effective, not less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a thoughtful, measured way to do that—one that preserves expertise and institutional memory, and allows for structured debate about genuinely complex issues. It looks like such a process would have to take place in spite of Kennedy, not because of him. And that’s not going to be easy as long as he remains in charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-prescription-pure-chaos-vaccines-cdc-monarez-acip/comments","text":"Leave a comment","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jr-prescription-pure-chaos-vaccines-cdc-monarez-acip/comments" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leave a comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 12:01:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNV2pFdWJMNFRNMjRwdHp2SVhDdlJscmpTZHJGYllVM1Jad0ZfNFNhLWk3TzBTWVAxcllhWDdzb3RvT1NIQlRSb3Nqc1A3dmUwbmpOX3Q0bnBqTGVKWjUtdTdUbi1VNVozamVtdi1FZjdLMzY0aFZDV0lmSldHUk1vaFhsVW83SzViT3FFUFdn</guid></item><item><title>以色列医院在催眠下进行脑深部手术-《耶路撒冷邮报》</title><link>https://www.jpost.com/science/article-868234</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Jerusalem Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 10:10:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiV0FVX3lxTFBqVW9PdUtVNnM2MFVtUmR0QU9VZVhfZXV0bFJZbkF2V2xheWNlR1BHZVE2eXVkWEtFTG1kZm85YTZUa3dZbWE5RjJrUzlYdFdoV1MyNW5mQQ</guid></item><item><title>四杯咖啡和更多步行：保护肝脏的日常习惯-《每日电讯报》</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/daily-habits-that-protect-your-liver/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;The liver is the central factory in our bodies, filtering out toxins, producing proteins for blood clotting and metabolising food into energy, but when it’s damaged, that all starts to go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early stages of liver damage, symptoms are rather generic, like fatigue, lethargy and weight loss, hence why liver disease is often mistaken for other conditions. However, severe liver damage can lead to dementia-like symptoms such as extreme confusion or trouble focusing, because the liver is unable to clear toxins in the blood, which then infiltrate the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the classic symptom of jaundice, where you’ll see yellowing of the eyes and skin, because the liver can no longer excrete bilirubin, a yellow pigment produced when red blood cells break down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the prospect of liver damage may be frightening, the good news is it is an incredibly resilient organ that can recover under the right conditions. I’m still astounded at how quickly the liver regenerates. This is why it’s never too late to give up alcohol or start losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In keeping our livers healthy, it’s important to focus on prevention. Luckily, there are all sorts of things we can do to protect this vital organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are my top science-backed tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;1. Drink 3-4 cups of coffee a day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health benefits and risks of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/coffee/"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; are an incredibly well-researched topic. We know it boosts our energy and can help with concentration, while too much of it can lead to insomnia and anxiety. However, fewer people realise the power that coffee holds as an anti-fibrotic, which prevents or reduces scar tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s incredibly good for the liver, and I drink three to four cups of it each day to maximise these benefits, usually sticking to black coffee, as added dairy or sugars can reduce its powerful antioxidant and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/anti-inflammatory-diet-guide/"&gt;anti-inflammatory effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2025 study, researchers found that giving patients with cirrhosis 400mg of caffeine (roughly four cups) each day improved their liver function. In an older review by the British Liver Trust, they found that regularly drinking moderate amounts of coffee in any form, even decaf, may prevent liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we’re still unsure exactly why caffeine possesses this unique power, we believe its protective effects lie in its potent combination of compounds and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;2. Swap your butter for olive oil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I’m cooking, I try not to use butter or animal fats and avoid saturated fats like red meat and full-fat dairy wherever possible. A 2018 study in &lt;em&gt;Diabetes Care&lt;/em&gt; found that saturated fat is more harmful for the human liver than unsaturated fat or simple sugars because it increases the concentration of fat molecules and causes inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

The FDA declared the scarcities resolved over the past year, so if people wanted to keep &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/upcoming-glp1-weight-loss-drugs-to-watch-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;taking the GLP-1s&lt;/a&gt;, they would need to switch to the patented versions. Many patients were not thrilled with this, given the eye-watering &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doctor-how-patients-afford-glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-2024-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;price tags&lt;/a&gt; on the official stuff, but the law appeared to clearly state that once the drugs were no longer in short supply, the pharmacies making the dupes had to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the law seems a little less clear — or at least different interpretations of it are pushing into more gray areas. While platforms such as Ro and Weight Watchers have stopped selling and advertising compounded GLP-1s, others, such as the direct-to-consumer telehealth company &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hims-hers-stock-plunges-novo-nordisk-weightloss-drugs-partnership-ends-2025-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Hims &amp;amp; Hers&lt;/a&gt;, have kept on keeping on. Compounders say they have found loopholes that mean they can continue to sell copycat weight-loss drugs, despite warnings from the FDA about safety and legal threats from drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk has estimated that about 1 million patients in the US are still on compounded GLP-1s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of affairs epitomizes a lot of what's wrong with the American healthcare system: Drugmakers have stumbled upon a miracle drug, but because of patents and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-prescription-drugs-prices-big-pharma-executive-order-medicines-cost-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;drug pricing&lt;/a&gt;, many Americans aren't able to access it. People, understandably, are willing to push the limits to get their hands on them, and market players have seized the financial opportunity to meet that need, even amid potential legal and medical risks. After all, what good is a miracle if it's out of reach?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;To provide some brief historical context, the brand-name versions of semaglutide and tirzepatide were so popular when they hit the US market in 2018 and 2022, respectively, that &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buy-compounded-semaglutide-online-risks-wegovy-ozempic-2023-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;manufacturers were unable&lt;/a&gt; to keep up with demand. People were complaining that diabetes patients were losing access to Ozempic because people who were being prescribed Wegovy for weight loss were gobbling up the supply. (They're the exact same drug, just with different names for their different prescribing purposes.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-quote="I thought they were going to go away in the spring for the most part." data-source=""&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout"&gt;&lt;q class="pullquote-quotation heading-md"&gt;I thought they were going to go away in the spring for the most part.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/es-blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the FDA put the drugs on its shortage list, which allowed compounding pharmacies — specialized pharmacies that prepare custom medications — to create their own versions of the injectable drugs. These formulations themselves weren't FDA-approved, but the law allows FDA-regulated pharmacies to make them in certain instances, including shortages or to meet specific patient needs. Given how popular the drugs were, many companies were eager to jump on the opportunity to get into the GLP-1 business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the drugs were &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fda-shortage-of-weight-loss-drug-tirzepatide-zepbound-is-over-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;pulled off the shortage list&lt;/a&gt;, which tirzepatide was in late 2024 and semaglutide was in early 2025, the compounders were supposed to halt production, since the law states it's illegal for them to create what are "essentially" a copy of a commercially available, FDA-approved drug.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p class="newsletter-dynamic" aria-expanded="true" aria-hidden="false" data-track-view='{"element_name":"inline_newsletter","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned","subscription_experience":"bi_value_unassigned"}' data-component-type="newsletter-dynamic" data-load-strategy="lazy" data-element-name="inline_newsletter" data-source="healthinlinesignup" data-skeleton-name="generic-tout"&gt;
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought they were going to go away in the spring for the most part," says Gina Moore, a senior associate dean at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/weight-loss-drugs-craze-healthcare-weight-watchers-ozempic-2023-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;direct-to-consumer companies and pharmacies&lt;/a&gt; say they've found a workaround: "personalization." These compounders add an ingredient to the drug formula — for example, vitamins B6 or B12, saying it may help alleviate nausea associated with GLP1s — or modify the dosage amounts. This allows them to argue that the drugs they're prescribing and distributing are a special formulation dictated by a doctor or prescriber. This is broadly aligned with the purpose of compounding pharmacies: They make medications for people with unique needs that necessitate a special formulation. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which outlines much of how the FDA is intended to regulate, allows personalized compounding, for example, so that a patient with a dye allergy or who has trouble swallowing can get the medication they need. But the small tweaks to the GLP-1s are stretching the limits on "personalization," says John Hertig, a healthcare consultant, since some pharmacies may be distributing the same "personalized" version "on a mass scale, which doesn't really then meet the definition of personalization, does it?"&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;"It's not meant to take tirzepatide and then add B12 and say, 'Oh, this is different just for you. And also we're going to do it in thousands and thousands and thousands of doses with prearranged telehealth relationships with physicians who are just prescribing this nonstop,'" Hertig says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see just how easy it still is to access these compounded weight-loss drugs, I went to a telehealth company website, input some random information about my height, weight, and health, and was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-really-like-find-affordable-weight-loss-drugs-patient-2024-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;prescribed a GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; without ever speaking to a doctor. That does not feel very personal to me. There are pharmacies, companies, lawyers, lobbyists who say that qualifies as coloring within the lines — medical appointments where patients and doctors don't meet live are possible in the age of telehealth, and just because you have the same needs as other people, doesn't mean the drug isn't "personalized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of these sites, you fill out the questionnaire, then the prescriber looks at the questionnaire and then makes a determination whether they want to prescribe the drug. There is a prescription somewhere, you're just not seeing it," says Martha Rumore, an attorney at the Health Law Alliance, a group of healthcare defense lawyers. "The prescriber has to indicate on the prescription what the medical necessity is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/fda" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;The FDA&lt;/a&gt; has issued warnings about the potential risks of using non-FDA-approved compounded GLP-1s, before and after ending the shortage. This month, the FDA sent a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/hims-hers-health-inc-dba-hims-09092025" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=""&gt;warning letter&lt;/a&gt; to Hims &amp;amp; Hers regarding claims it makes on its website about its compounded semaglutide that it alleges imply the company's products are the same as an FDA-approved product when they are not. It was part of a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-launches-crackdown-deceptive-drug-advertising" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=""&gt;larger crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on deceptive advertising by direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical companies by the FDA, though some experts I spoke with say the regulator could do more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the current presidential administration, they're deferring more to the patient-doctor relationship and not challenging that and having that come into question as much as perhaps other administrations," Moore says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an email to Business Insider, a Health and Human Services spokesperson noted that compounded drugs are not FDA-approved, meaning the agency "does not review compounded drugs for safety, effectiveness, or quality before they are marketed" and therefore recommends FDA-approved drugs where available and safe for the patient. The spokesperson added they've gotten reports about patients making mistakes with dosing or being prescribed extra-large or extra-frequent doses of GLP1s and said that healthcare providers "should be vigilant" when prescribing compounded weight-loss medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-right" data-quote="Technically, price is not supposed to be a factor in whether or not a compounded drug is dispensed, but it's an unavoidable factor right now." data-source=""&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote-wrapper pullquote-right"&gt;&lt;q class="pullquote-quotation heading-md"&gt;Technically, price is not supposed to be a factor in whether or not a compounded drug is dispensed, but it's an unavoidable factor right now.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/es-blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some states have taken action on GLP-1 compounding. Ohio, for instance, has cracked down on &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-go-to-med-spas-abroad-save-money-treatments-injectables-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;medspas&lt;/a&gt; dispensing the drugs and is limiting the drug batch sizes pharmacies are allowed to produce, which could hit Hims &amp;amp; Hers. Drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have also tried to take legal action to keep compounders at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to Business Insider, a Hims &amp;amp; Hers spokesperson said that "one-size-fits-all care is outdated." They added that the company follows "carefully written compounding regulations" and only offers access to medications when a licensed provider independently decides it's necessary for a patient. Regarding the FDA's letter and actions out of Ohio, the spokesperson said that Hims &amp;amp; Hers appreciates the FDA's efforts "to make sure health information is accessible in a way that helps consumers make informed choices," touted the company's "industry-leading facilities," and noted it has a track record of working with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/section&gt;
          &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;The story around GLP-1s is as much about money as it is about health. The &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-weight-loss-drugs-expensive-cost-ozempic-mounjaro-zepbound-wegovy-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;name-brand medications are expensive&lt;/a&gt;, and often not covered by insurance, so people turn to more affordable, accessible versions. Some patients would also be turned down by their doctors or insurance companies for brand-name drugs, so they turn to compounding companies that are often more lax with prescribing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Technically, price is not supposed to be a factor in whether or not a compounded drug is dispensed, but it's an unavoidable factor right now," says Scott Brunner, the CEO of the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, an industry group. "Prescribers are sitting down with Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Jones who said, 'I want some of this stuff to manage my weight or manage my diabetes, but I can't afford that FDA-approved drug.' And I believe prescribers are sympathetic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers have brought the costs of the brand-name drugs down, in part, to fend off the compounders. &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eli-lilly-cut-price-zepbound-tirzepatide-weight-loss-drug-copycats-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Eli Lilly offers self-pay options&lt;/a&gt; for Zepbound for as low as $349 for the smaller starter dose and $499 for the higher doses in vials, compared to only price options of over $1,000 a month when it was first released. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/novo-nordisk-stock-rises-6percent-in-a-week--what-should-investors-do-14565262" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt; has a $499 option for its drugs, a discount from the original roughly $1,000 price. It's still more expensive than the compounded versions — Hims &amp;amp; Hers, for example, sells semaglutide starting at $199 a month — but it's getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The lower-priced compounded drug is actually serving to drive down the price of the FDA-approved drug," Brunner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients may already be deciding that paying a couple of hundred dollars extra each month to get FDA-approved medications is worth it. If pricing comes down further, pharmacies and companies selling compounded versions will be squeezed more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we see the branded manufacturers drop price, these compounders will have to cut prices to a hundred bucks or whatever that compelling level is to maintain their value proposition to patients paying out of pocket," says Brian Tanquilut, a senior equity research analyst at Jefferies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that compounded semaglutide is generally more widely available than compounded tirzepatide — Hims &amp;amp; Hers, for example, only sells the former. Tanquilut says that's because tirzepatide is viewed as a "cleaner" drug with fewer side effects, so there's less need for added "personalized" ingredients in theory. He also points out that Novo Nordisk's US patent on semaglutide runs out in 2031, while Eli Lilly's expires in 2036. Some companies may make the calculation that even if Novo Nordisk were to sue, the resulting legal battle would last until they could make generics anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/semaglutide" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; is also a more recognizable name than tirzepatide, even though the latter is more effective. Eli Lilly came out with a cheaper consumer offering for its medication before Novo Nordisk did, which may have discouraged some compounders from trying to get into the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;The arrival of super-effective weight-loss drugs to the market has opened up a financial, medical, and regulatory can of worms. A lot of parties stand to make a lot of money — drugmakers, compounders, telehealth operations, etc. — and so there is a lot of effort to figure out, say, creative interpretations of the laws. And for patients, it's understandable to want a relatively easy &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/practical-simple-weight-loss-tips-people-lost-fat-kept-off-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;solution to weight loss,&lt;/a&gt; especially when other avenues have failed, and to want it at a price that won't mean big sacrifices in other parts of their lives or breaking the bank. The best hope is that eventually, the name-brand formulations will become inexpensive enough that affordability and access won't be as much of an issue, and that, even more eventually, generics will become available once patents expire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's the problem with much of the American healthcare system — there are a lot of hopes and eventuallys in the mix, and in the meantime, patients are caught in the expensive and confusing crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/emily-stewart" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emily Stewart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;I used to be one of those people who wore their eight hours of sleep like a badge of honor. "I get my full eight hours," I'd tell anyone who'd listen, usually while stifling a yawn and reaching for my third cup of coffee. It wasn't until a particularly brutal morning—when I'd slept from 10 PM to 6 AM and still felt like I'd been hit by a truck—that I realized something was fundamentally wrong with my understanding of rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom is simple: eight hours equals good sleep. Less than that, and you're sleep-deprived. More, and you're oversleeping. But as I discovered through a journey that took me from sleep labs to meditation retreats, from nutritionists' offices to my own bedroom, the truth about why we wake up exhausted is far more complex—and far more revealing about the intricate ways our bodies try to communicate with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Your Sleep Architecture Is Crumbling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first revelation came in a sterile room at a sleep clinic, electrodes attached to my scalp like some science fiction experiment. Dr. Sarah Chen, a sleep specialist who'd seen thousands of patients like me, pulled up my sleep study results on her computer. "See these waves?" she said, pointing to what looked like a seismograph during an earthquake. "You're getting eight hours in bed, but you're not cycling through sleep stages properly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I learned that day fundamentally changed how I thought about sleep. It's not just about duration—it's about architecture. Our sleep is supposed to move through predictable cycles: light sleep, deep sleep, REM sleep, repeat. Each cycle should last about 90 minutes, and we need four to six complete cycles for true restoration. But stress, alcohol, late-night screens, or even an uncomfortable mattress can fragment these cycles, leaving us with what Dr. Chen called "junk sleep"—hours that count on the clock but don't count for recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started tracking my sleep with a wearable device, not obsessively checking the numbers but learning to recognize patterns. The nights I felt most rested weren't always my longest—they were the nights when my sleep cycles remained uninterrupted, when I moved through each stage like a well-rehearsed dance rather than a chaotic stumble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. The Silent Struggle for Oxygen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second piece of the puzzle fell into place unexpectedly, during a routine dental cleaning. My hygienist, of all people, noticed something. "Has anyone ever told you that you might have sleep apnea?" she asked, peering at my throat. I laughed it off—I didn't snore loudly, I wasn't overweight, I didn't fit the profile. But her observation nagged at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that sleep apnea doesn't always announce itself with thunderous snoring. Sometimes it's subtle—a slight narrowing of the airway, a gentle interruption in breathing that's just enough to pull you from deep sleep without fully waking you. Your body, in its wisdom, prioritizes breathing over rest, sacrificing sleep quality to keep you alive. Each micro-awakening is forgotten by morning, but the exhaustion remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After another sleep study—this one specifically looking for breathing issues—I discovered I had mild sleep apnea. Thirty times an hour, my breathing would pause just long enough for my brain to panic and partially wake me. No wonder I felt tired; I was fighting for air all night long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution was surprisingly simple: sleeping on my side instead of my back, using a wedge pillow, and practicing breathing exercises before bed. Within weeks, my morning exhaustion began to lift like fog burning off in sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Dehydration in Disguise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd always prided myself on drinking enough water during the day, carrying my reusable bottle everywhere like a talisman against dehydration. But it wasn't until I met with a sports nutritionist for an unrelated issue that I learned about nocturnal dehydration—a phenomenon that had been sabotaging my sleep for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Your body loses about a liter of water through breathing and perspiration during eight hours of sleep," she explained. "If you're not properly hydrated before bed, or if your bedroom is too warm and dry, you wake up with your body in a mild state of dehydration. And dehydration mimics exhaustion almost perfectly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix seemed almost too simple: a glass of water with a pinch of sea salt an hour before bed, a humidifier in my bedroom, and keeping the temperature between 65-68 degrees Fahrenheit. The first morning after implementing these changes, I woke up feeling different—not miraculous, but noticeably less sluggish, as if someone had oiled rusty gears in my body overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. The Blood Sugar Rollercoaster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My relationship with late-night snacking had always been complicated. Some nights I'd go to bed with a growling stomach, others after demolishing half a pint of ice cream. Both, as I learned from an endocrinologist during a routine check-up, were wreaking havoc on my sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Your blood sugar doesn't clock out when you go to bed," Dr. Martinez explained, sketching a graph that looked like a particularly aggressive rollercoaster. "When it drops too low during the night, your body releases stress hormones to bring it back up. Those hormones—cortisol and adrenaline—are the same ones that wake you up in the morning. But if they're spiking at 3 AM, you're getting poor quality sleep even if you don't fully wake up."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposite was equally problematic. Going to bed after a sugar binge meant my blood sugar would crash in the early morning hours, triggering the same stress response. Either way, I was setting myself up for exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started experimenting with my evening eating, finding that a small portion of complex carbohydrates with protein about two hours before bed—think apple slices with almond butter or a small portion of Greek yogurt with berries—kept my blood sugar stable through the night. The difference was subtle but consistent: fewer morning headaches, less grogginess, more mental clarity upon waking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Stress Hormones Going Haywire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the revelations on my journey to understanding exhaustion, this one hit closest to home. I'd always been a worrier, but I'd never connected my racing thoughts to my morning fatigue. It wasn't until I attended a workshop on stress and sleep that I understood the vicious cycle I'd trapped myself in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cortisol is supposed to be lowest at night and highest in the morning," the instructor explained. "But chronic stress flips this rhythm. You go to bed wired and wake up tired." She might as well have been describing my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cortisol rhythm was indeed inverted, confirmed by a saliva test that tracked my hormone levels throughout the day. Evenings found me energized and anxious, mornings sluggish and depleted. My body was trying to tell me that my stress management—or lack thereof—was destroying my sleep from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path forward required more than just better sleep hygiene. I had to address the root cause: my relationship with stress. Meditation, therapy, and learning to set boundaries at work all became part of my sleep improvement plan. It was the hardest change to implement but perhaps the most transformative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Hidden Inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months into my journey, I thought I'd uncovered all the reasons for my exhaustion. Then I developed a strange rash that led me to an allergist, and another piece of the puzzle clicked into place. The allergy tests revealed sensitivities to several foods I ate regularly, including dairy and gluten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When your body is constantly fighting inflammation from food sensitivities, environmental allergens, or other sources, it's like running a low-grade fever all the time," the allergist explained. "Your immune system never gets to rest, even when you're sleeping."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was skeptical—how could what I ate for lunch affect how I felt the next morning? But after eliminating trigger foods for a month, the difference was undeniable. Not only did the rash disappear, but I woke up feeling lighter, less puffy, more energetic. My body had been trying to tell me through exhaustion what it couldn't communicate directly: that it was fighting a battle I didn't even know was happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led me down a rabbit hole of anti-inflammatory practices: adding turmeric to my evening routine,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some people swear apple-cider vinegar (ACV) can help with weight loss. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;However, dietitians say research supporting the link between ACV and weight loss is weak. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ACV may help some people manage blood sugar and cholesterol. But research is mixed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apple-cider vinegar (ACV) may be all the rage now, but it’s been around for thousands of years. This all-natural remedy is made simply by fermenting apples. While it’s a go-to in many kitchens, in health circles it’s gained a reputation as a magic elixir. In fact, ACV has been touted for everything from clearing up acne and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001265/can-you-reverse-diabetes-what-experts-say/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reversing diabetes&lt;/a&gt; to melting away fat and promoting faster weight loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But is there actual science to back up these bold claims? To find out, we asked dietitians what they really think about apple-cider vinegar, especially for weight loss. Here’s what they told us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wondering what ACV can—and can’t—do for you, here’s what you need to know.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While apple-cider vinegar is not a cure-all, some evidence suggests it might help manage blood sugar. But only for some people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="http://jennabraddock.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jenna Braddock, M.S.H., RDN, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, points to the results of one systematic review and meta-analysis on the impact of ACV on blood glucose and cholesterol. Its findings: Apple-cider vinegar consumption for eight weeks may help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290850/diabetes-myths-that-dont-lower-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower blood glucose&lt;/a&gt;, but only in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290924/diabetes-information-know-the-basics/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;people with diabetes&lt;/a&gt; (more on the cholesterol angle soon).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another study reported similar results. In this study, volunteers with diabetes who consumed 30 milliliters (about 2 tablespoons) of apple-cider vinegar daily for eight weeks paired with a balanced eating plan experienced significant &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291826/7-simple-ways-to-reverse-prediabetes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reductions in fasting glucose&lt;/a&gt; and A1C.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, a control group that also followed a healthy eating pattern (but didn’t consume ACV) had no reduction in A1C, and only a nonsignificant decline in fasting glucose. So, while ACV might be helpful if you have diabetes, there’s not enough research to show that it will lower everyone’s blood sugar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wondering how ACV may help reduce blood sugar in people with diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cassandra-lepore" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cassandra Lepore, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, points to its &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/apple-cider-vinegar-benefits-11742971" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;acetic acid&lt;/a&gt;. “Acetic acid in apple-cider vinegar may slow gastric emptying, delaying the passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine,” she says. This might also indirectly help people with diabetes lose weight. The reason? Slower digestion helps prevent sharp spikes and dips in blood sugar levels, says Braddock. This can keep you feeling full longer, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7905014/the-1-habit-you-should-break-to-lose-weight-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;reducing the likelihood of overeating&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of ACV’s most popular claims is that it can melt or burn away fat. However, dietitians say not so fast! “There is limited research to suggest that consuming apple-cider vinegar may help with weight loss,” says &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/sargent/profile/joan-salge-blake-ms-rd-ldn/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Joan Salge Blake, Ed.D., RDN, FAND&lt;/a&gt;. She explains that in studies where ACV was paired with a low-calorie eating plan, participants did lose weight. But the control groups, who didn’t consume ACV, also lost weight. So, it's more likely that the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy eating plan&lt;/a&gt; was behind their weight loss, rather than the ACV.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there may be a few small studies that found a link, &lt;a href="https://signup.usenourish.com/providers/manjushree-karkare" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Manju Karkare, M.S., RDN, FAND&lt;/a&gt;, questions their methods. “While there may have been some studies that showed improved weight loss with daily consumption of ACV, most of these studies had inadequacies such as study design, duration of the study or number of participants,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lose-body-fat-8619424" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lasting fat loss&lt;/a&gt; requires more than just one food or supplement, says Lepore. “Many people believe that apple-cider vinegar alone can lead to fat loss. But this overlooks the fact that lasting weight loss requires lifestyle changes like diet and exercise,” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Might Help Lower Cholesterol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If there is one area where ACV shows promise, it’s in supporting healthy cholesterol levels. Remember that systematic review and meta-analysis that looked at blood glucose? It also examined ACV’s impact on cholesterol and found that consuming 15 mL of ACV per day significantly lowered total cholesterol. However, the greatest benefits were seen in people with type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, the study also revealed a link between ACV consumption and significant improvements in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898451/how-to-raise-good-cholesterol-levels-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;favorable HDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, but only in healthy individuals. While these results are encouraging for heart health, they won’t result in weight loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wondering how ACV may lower cholesterol, experts believe it works by stimulating the body to excrete cholesterol building blocks, called bile acids. With fewer bile acids on board, the liver can’t make as much cholesterol, so blood cholesterol levels drop.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may have heard that ACV can ease digestive woes, such as constipation or bloating, but there isn’t strong evidence backing this up either. “There’s a common claim online that apple-cider vinegar can cure digestive problems and reset the gut microbiome,” says Lepore. “In reality, the gut is highly complex and often requires more comprehensive interventions. And there is little to no evidence proving that ACV can resolve chronic digestive issues.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But what about its supposed &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16530/can-probiotics-really-help-your-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotic properties&lt;/a&gt;?  While apple-cider vinegar is a fermented food, most ACV sold in stores is actually pasteurized. This process kills off any beneficial bacteria that might support digestive health. And even raw, unfiltered ACV doesn’t have enough live bacteria to qualify as a probiotic food, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The consensus among dietitians is that ACV is OK to add to foods and beverages. But they don’t recommend supplementing with it for weight loss. That said, if you love its flavor, go ahead and whisk it into a cider vinaigrette or a glaze for salmon or chicken. You can even stir it into mocktails.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No matter how you use it, be sure to dilute it with other liquids and avoid drinking it on its own. “I would not recommend consuming it as a stand-alone daily beverage, as it is very acidic and could damage your tooth enamel, increasing the risk of tooth decay,” says Salge Blake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Straight ACV can also make your throat burn and upset your stomach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apple-cider vinegar has been promoted as a magical remedy for various health issues, especially weight loss. Can it work for you? Dietitians say that right now there’s not enough research to support a link between ACV and weight loss. While there has been some encouraging research on its ability to help manage blood sugar, these findings only relate to people with diabetes. On the upside, ACV might help lower cholesterol, but more research is needed. And if you’re taking it to reduce bloating or help you poop, it’s unlikely to help there either.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, if you love ACV’s flavor, go ahead and add it to your favorite salad dressing, sauce or mocktail. Just don’t drink it straight, as research has shown its acid can erode your tooth enamel. As in most cases, a food-first approach is the way to go!&lt;br&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagine tossing aside your reading glasses and regaining crisp, youthful vision with just a few drops a day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New research suggests that specially formulated eye drops can significantly improve near vision in people with presbyopia — age-related difficulty focusing on close objects. Patients reported sharper sight within an hour, sustained improvements for up to two years, and only mild, temporary side effects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Eye Drops That Sharpen Sight Without Glasses&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone experiences presbyopia as they get older, which makes it harder to focus on nearby objects and read small print. For many, the solution is reading glasses, but new research suggests that relief could be as simple as applying special eye drops two or three times each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the 43rd Congress of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS),&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; researchers presented the results of a retrospective study involving 766 patients. Most participants were able to read two, three, or even more additional lines on the Jaeger chart, a tool used to measure near vision, after using the specially designed drops. This improvement lasted for as long as two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;An Innovative Alternative to Glasses and Surgery&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Giovanna Benozzi, director of the Center for Advanced Research for Presbyopia, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, said: “We conducted this research due to the significant unmet medical need in presbyopia management. Current solutions, such as reading glasses or surgical interventions, have limitations, including inconvenience, social discomfort, and potential risks or complications. There is a group of presbyopia patients who have limited options besides spectacles, and who are not candidates for surgery; these are our primary focus of interest. We sought to provide robust clinical evidence supporting an innovative pharmacological solution to offer patients a non-invasive, convenient, and effective alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drops were originally developed by Dr. Benozzi’s father, the late Dr. Jorge Benozzi, at the same center. They combine two active ingredients: pilocarpine, which constricts the pupils and activates the ciliary muscle that adjusts the eye’s focus for objects at different distances, and diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation and helps ease the discomfort often caused by pilocarpine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Testing Pilocarpine Formulations Across Hundreds of Patients&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients administered the eye drops twice a day, usually on waking and again approximately six hours later, with an optional third dose if symptoms recurred or additional visual comfort was needed. The group of patients (373 women and 393 men, with an average age of 55) was divided into three groups to receive one of three eye drop formulations. Each formulation had a fixed dose of diclofenac, but concentrations of pilocarpine were 1%, 2% and 3%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers assessed the improvement in how well patients could read the Jaeger chart without reading glasses (uncorrected near visual acuity) one hour after the first administration of the drops, and they followed up the patients for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rapid and Lasting Vision Improvements Observed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Benozzi told the Congress: “Our most significant result showed rapid and sustained improvements in near vision for all three concentrations. One hour after having the first drops, patients had an average improvement of 3.45 Jaeger lines. The treatment also improved focus at all distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Impressively, 99% of 148 patients in the 1% pilocarpine group reached optimal near vision and were able to read two or more extra lines. Approximately 83% of all patients maintained good functional near vision at 12 months. Importantly, no significant adverse events like increased intraocular pressure or retinal detachment were observed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Impressive Outcomes Across All Dosage Groups&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2% group, 69% of 248 patients were able to read three or more extra lines on the Jaeger chart, and in the 3% group, 84% of 370 patients could read three or more extra lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improvement in the patients’ vision was sustained for up to two years, with a median duration of 434 days. Adverse side effects were mild, with the most common being temporary dim vision, which occurred in 32% of cases, irritation when the drops were instilled (3.7%) and headache (3.8%). No patients discontinued the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common adverse side effects of pilocarpine can also include eye redness, watery eyes, blurred vision, dim or dark vision, sensitivity to light or problems changing focus between objects, seeing flashes of light or “floaters” in vision, and, in rare cases, detached retinas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tailoring Treatment Based on Presbyopia Severity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Benozzi continued: “Nearly all patients experienced positive improvements in near visual acuity, although the magnitude of the improvement depended on the status of their vision before treatment at baseline. Our study revealed that optimal pilocarpine concentrations could be individualised depending on the baseline severity of presbyopia as assessed by the initial Jaeger scores. Patients with less severe presbyopia responded best to 1% concentrations, while those with more advanced presbyopia required higher 2% or 3% concentrations to achieve significant visual improvement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She concluded: “These results suggest this combination therapy offers a safe, effective, and well-tolerated alternative to traditional presbyopia management. It significantly reduces dependence on reading glasses, providing a convenient, non-invasive option for patients, although these eye drops may not eliminate the need for glasses in all individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Importantly, this treatment is not intended to replace surgical interventions, but rather to serve as a valuable solution for patients who need safe, effective, and personalised alternatives and seek freedom from the inconvenience of eyewear. Eye care professionals now have an evidence-based pharmacological option that expands the spectrum of presbyopia care beyond glasses and surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Long-Term Research and Next Steps in Presbyopia Care&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the group of patients in this study, Dr. Benozzi has other patients who have received the treatment for more than ten years. Dr. Benozzi plans further research to measure improvements in patients’ quality of life, and to explore the underlying physiological mechanisms of the eye drops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengths of the study include the large number of patients included and the long follow-up time. It is the first systematic evaluation comparing three different pilocarpine concentrations in combination with diclofenac. A limitation is that it is a retrospective, single-centre study, which could limit the generalisability of the findings and introduce selection bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESCRS President-Elect, Professor Burkhard Dick, chair of the ophthalmology department at the University Eye Hospital Bochum, Germany, was not involved in the research. He commented, “While surgery for age-related near vision loss has advanced, some patients are not candidates. The single-centre retrospective study by Dr. Benozzi suggests that eye drops containing pilocarpine and diclofenac may improve near vision for up to two years, but the limited design means the results may not apply to everyone. Long-term pilocarpine use can sometimes cause side effects such as reduced night vision, dimmer vision in low light, eye strain, irritation and, in rare cases, retinal detachment, while prolonged topical NSAID use may pose corneal risks. Broader, long-term, multi-centre studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;

This potential danger is especially concerning for those over 65 whose weight repeatedly shifts by 'more than 5%'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fresh study, conducted by &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/health-and-human-development/story/weight-change-may-contribute-cognitive-decline-older-adults" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Pennsylvania State University&lt;/a&gt;, examined 11 years of weight, body mass index, and waist measurement data to determine their impact on brain changes. The research encompassed information from more than 4,000 senior participants, with records spanning 2011 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regrettably, irrespective of the analytical approach taken by researchers, one trend emerged as 'crystal clear'. Whilst some cognitive deterioration is anticipated with advancing age, people experiencing greater weight variations faced significantly raised risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Muzi Na explained: "We examined 11 years of data related to weight, body mass index and waist circumference. We conducted three different types of analysis on how those measures compared to cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Any way we looked at the data, the relationship was crystal clear — the more a person’s weight varied from year to year, the faster that person experienced cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline generally refers to the onset of challenges with a person's reasoning, memory, learning, or judgement capabilities. Warning signs may include difficulty focusing or completing routine activities, memory problems, and comprehension issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having mild cognitive impairment, a common form of cognitive decline, can potentially increase the risk of developing dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease and similar conditions. Currently, the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; estimates that over 944,000 people in the UK are grappling with dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Within the new research, scientists discovered that both 'losing at least 5% of one’s weight' and 'cycling between weight loss and gain of at least 5% of one’s weight' were associated with accelerated cognitive decline. Meanwhile, older adults who gained weight demonstrated a comparable level of cognitive decline to those whose weight remained steady.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the researchers stressed this doesn't mean putting on weight is advisable either. Associate Professor Na continued: "Mid-life obesity is a known risk factor for cognitive decline later in life, but there is an 'obesity paradox' associating late-life obesity with a healthier cognitive trajectory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Some studies have revealed a complex interplay between &lt;a href="https://karger.com/ofa/article/15/3/321/825712" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;age-related muscle mass loss and fat gain in older adults&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and our study does not suggest older adults should gain weight."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In light of these findings, Dr Na said that older adults should monitor their weight at home more regularly. For example, this could simply involve stepping onto the scales at the same time each morning before breakfast to provide a reliable dataset. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If their weight varies considerably, Associate Professor Na believes it may be best to consult a physician for further guidance. She continued: "From one doctor’s appointment to the next, the way weight is measured may not be consistent. Perhaps you have your coat and shoes on one time, and the next time you are in light clothes and socks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"To make sure you understand what is happening to their body and brain, older adults should track their weight at home in a more consistent way."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2&gt;Potential early signs of dementia&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whilst dementia symptoms can vary depending on the specific type, typical early indicators may include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Memory loss&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Struggling to follow a conversation or find the right word&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Being confused about time and place&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Mood changes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Difficulty concentrating&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Finding it hard to carry out familiar daily tasks, such as getting confused over the correct change when shopping&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The NHS advises anyone experiencing these symptoms to seek medical guidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNejZVR0NnQ1llOTRfUkZhR3ltaUc2a1dHQjJQUmJRTFFNSTJrbTNvWmtoWC1IcHZMSEJBTjNLblpYUTdzS3h4b19hMGJ6Z2NEd0hOV0xFMjhUVEkzazlVT25TNXhweDN4QlFoNTMwTU5YbUFyYXRNUDY4Y21rZ3FHcnE1akE2Y0RhbG1DWVdVLXNZUjZxMWfSAZsBQVVfeXFMTk9JdF92ekhLVjNncFZqZGh0T3VCc2ZVanVrVjdkUnlzczFDaHNOMHhsbWl6QWFfT09zMXpzWVhxdmRheWs0NkZWd2d3SVh1VHBoVnotQnhIYkhrUW5NMHN6LXNQLURPZHR4UGRQaVpZMXhiVkd1OFZFWTBJcnhlRmEzS0Q1aVJUaDRQVE1JcTNBRXJyaFdTY21MS3c</guid></item><item><title>“日落”是我们谈论不够的痴呆症症状- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/seraphinaseow/sundowning-dementia-symptom-sc</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;Disorientation and confusion underpin most of the other sundowning symptoms and behaviors. As the day is ending, people may start to be uncertain and confused about what’s going on in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, if their family is preparing dinner, the patient might be thinking, ‘What are these people doing?’ They don’t understand the activity around preparing the meal,” Diaz said. They may also feel that they are in the &lt;a href="https://www.dementia.org.au/living-dementia/mood-and-behaviour-changes/restlessness" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7944365" data-affiliate="true"&gt;wrong place&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, they may become agitated and restless. “They might pace around or rock in the chair, things like that, where there’s visibility, an inability to relax,” Krowel said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person may become anxious, irritable, upset or aggressive. They may also have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, Diaz said. “Relatives may say they observe the patient wandering at night, because they’re not sleeping at night and reversing the day with the night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms “present differently from patient to patient, because there is more than one form of dementia,” Diaz noted. Visual or auditory hallucinations are more common in those with Lewy body Dementia, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to learn to tell sundowning apart from delirium, though, as symptoms can appear similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delirium may mean the person is going through a condition that is critical and in some cases, life-threatening, so being able to identify its root cause is essential. “Disorientation in delirium [may mean] the patient is in a critical condition. It could be a bad infection, sepsis, a severe and sudden spike in blood pressure, very high blood sugar, or a manifestation of stroke in patients who are older,” Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main way to distinguish between delirium and sundowning is by remembering that the latter typically occurs around the time the sun is setting or at a specific time of day, whereas delirium occurs abruptly at any time of the day, Diaz explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the most part, once you find out what is causing the delirium, and treat it or get it under control, the delirium will subside,” he noted. Sundowning tends to recur, though there are ways to ease its symptoms when it does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect your loved one is experiencing delirium, Krowel advised seeing your primary care physician or going to emergency care, “depending on how severe the symptoms are at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can worsen sundowning? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

They contain healthy omega-3 fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary fiber, proteins, vitamins, and some minerals. They are also an excellent source of polyphenols and antioxidants, such as caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, myricetin, and quercetin, among others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 tbsp or 28 g of chia seeds &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170554/nutrients" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;contain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calories: 138&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 4.7 grams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 8.7 grams (including 5 grams of omega-3s)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carbohydrates: 12.3 grams (10.6 grams of fiber)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calcium: 18% of the Daily Value (DV)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnesium: 23% of the DV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phosphorus: 27% of the DV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin B1 (thiamine): 15% of the DV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin B3 (niacin): 16% of the DV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Can chia seeds pose a danger to health? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are good for your health, especially your gut and heart. But if they are not consumed the right way, it can be dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chia seeds are super healthy, but did you know eating them the wrong way can cause serious issues?” Dr. Sethi says in a video shared on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what’s the wrong way to eat chia seeds? Not soaking them. “You have to soak your chia seeds, or you risk this happening inside your body. I'm a gastroenterologist. People have ended up in the hospital after eating dry seeds and then drinking water. The seeds expanded and got stuck in the esophagus, and it had to be removed endoscopically. Even though it is rare, it has happened in people with swallowing issues or other GI conditions,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds can absorb water, so if you are not soaking them properly, the chances of ending up in an ER are high. “Chia seeds absorb up to 27 times their weight in water, so make sure to consume them the right way,” the doctor adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How to consume chia seeds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to consume chia seeds is after soaking them. “Soak them in water for at least 30 minutes, if not overnight.

Now, the criteria are stricter and the target blood pressures are lower than before. The criteria depend on the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. While the former, the top number, represents the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is pumping blood in the body, the latter, the bottom number is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines have removed the category of “prehypertension,” which was defined by a systolic pressure of 120-139 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), or a diastolic pressure of 80-99 mm Hg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the patients are categorised as having "elevated blood pressure" if their blood pressure is 120-129 over less than 80 mm Hg or stage 1 hypertension if they are 130-139/80-89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 2 hypertension is defined by a reading of 140/90 or more, and hypertensive crisis is signalled by a reading of 180/120 or greater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, people are advised to ask their doctors if they have hypertension based on this new criterion and whether or not they require treatment. They must also seek suggestions for changes in lifestyle such as diet, exercise and sleep habits to lower the blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usage of a risk calculator called PREVENT (Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS) to prevent a person's overall risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure is also advised. It is free and available online and incorporates several factors, including demographics, cholesterol levels, medical history and blood pressure, to determine risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limit alcohol intake to prevent high blood pressure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

A standard beer contains about 14g of alcohol and thus blood pressure may increase with alcohol consumption over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who don't want to completely avoid alcohol, the new guidelines recommend that men should drink no more than two drinks per day, and women should drink no more than one drink per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;DASH diets for hypertension&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

It emphasises the consumption of fruits, vegetables, low-fat or non-fat dairy and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Physical activity to the rescue&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Most organizations are still built on assumptions of bodily reliability and linear productivity, as if everyone follows the same GPS: steady roads, predictable stops, and a straight path from the effort to output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But living with chronic and degenerative illness and distressing diagnoses is not a detour; it is a different journey altogether. The road is uneven, often unpaved, and sometimes washed out without warning. You may be rerouted mid-meeting, stalled by fatigue, overcome by pain, or the need to adjust your position or location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chronic illness often begins with invisibility that prompts others to fill in the blanks. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue or distraction mistaken for disinterest; pain misread as irritability; brain fog interpreted as forgetfulness; or physical adaptations branded as “weird.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/news/mom-calls-out-attendance-awards"&gt;Mom Questions The Merits Of School Attendance Awards After Her Chronically Ill Daughter Was Excluded While Her Classmates Were Gifted Chocolate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike having a broken leg, which comes with a cast and immediate sympathy, chronic conditions linger in the shadows until they disrupt what others expect of us. When presentations of “symptoms” become undeniable — missed deadlines, canceled plans, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/mind-tricks-improve-mood-according-psychology"&gt;altered moods&lt;/a&gt; — the illness becomes “seen,” but often too late or too awkwardly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this situation, compassion at work must be skilled, not sentimental. Well-meaning colleagues might say, “Feel better soon,” as if this were a passing cold, not a permanent recalibration. Unlike some other afflictions, chronic illnesses do not resolve on a schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for those living with such chronic health conditions, like I have for decades, the challenge lies not only in the symptoms but also in managing the mismatch between external expectations and internal reality — at work, at home, and within &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-of-an-identity-crisis"&gt;one’s own sense of identity&lt;/a&gt; and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the workplace still expects everyone to arrive on time, use the same road, and pretend their journey is not more challenging, employees and precious talent will be lost. But what happens when our body no longer cooperates? How can managers support employees in these situations, and what can we all learn from those who must rearchitect their lives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I learned early in my life that I had to move through the world with a different map. Along the way, I met some people who seemed impatient when I slowed down or unkind when I diverged from norms to just get through the day — but I also met a few remarkable guides who just walked with me, without needing to know the whole story. This post is about what that journey has taught me, about work, leadership, and how we think of others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Below the water line: fragility and productivity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-09/people-with-chronic-illness-know-about-compassion.png" alt="woman with chronic illness who knows compassion" title="what people with chronic illness know about compassion" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;fizkes / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disease is part of life and the human condition. Chronic, genetic, and degenerative conditions are often invisible to others; can be progressive, episodic, or unpredictable; and require ongoing medical care, workplace flexibility, and emotional understanding. Perhaps most insidiously, they often come with stigma or disbelief — especially when symptoms are not outwardly visible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This invisibility leads many people to hide their diagnoses or downplay their needs, at the expense of their health, performance, and ability to connect to others. These conditions affect millions of people: colleagues, managers, family members, and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), epilepsy, ALS, and myasthenia gravis all impact how individuals move, speak, or think — and often unpredictably. MS alone affects roughly one million people in the United States, while epilepsy impacts over three million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn’s disease, and psoriatic arthritis are equally prevalent, with lupus affecting an estimated 1.5 million Americans and inflammatory bowel disease impacting around three million Americans. These conditions flare and recede, often without warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic and connective tissue disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (1 in 5,000), Marfan syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz Syndrome (1 in 100,000) can cause not only chronic pain, musculoskeletal deformation, exhaustion, and functional instability, but also sudden cardiac or pulmonary events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sufferers of fibromyalgia (which affects an estimated four million people in the U.S.) and chronic fatigue syndrome (experienced by 3.3 million American adults) share some of these life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endocrine and metabolic conditions — particularly diabetes and thyroid disorders — affect over 38 million and 20 million Americans, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many patients or sufferers remain underdiagnosed or misunderstood, and &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2021/the-intersection-of-mental-health-and-chronic-disease" rel="nofollow"&gt;mental health issues are frequent&lt;/a&gt;: clinical and epidemiologic evidence shows that the risk for depression is higher among those who suffer from chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add these up, and tens of millions of people in the U.S. alone (and their loved ones) are navigating &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-youre-overworked-underappreciated-every-aspect-your-life"&gt;the demands of work&lt;/a&gt;, family, and society with invisible limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health/serious-health-conditions-linked-directly-constantly-being-stressed-out"&gt;16 Serious Health Conditions Linked Directly To Constantly Being Stressed Out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Off-roading: inflection points and identity shifts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many workers with invisible conditions carry two burdens: their own symptoms and the discomfort these symptoms cause themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our book, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-71541-4" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compassionate Management of Mental Health in the Modern Workplace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we focused on how health challenges — especially chronic or acute illnesses — are critical &lt;em&gt;personal inflection points&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflection points affect not just how individuals feel but also how they function in all areas of life. At work, they may struggle with energy, focus, and reliability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At home, they may become dependent, altering established family roles. And they might withdraw from society because the cost of &lt;em&gt;engaging &lt;/em&gt;with others seems to outweigh the potential benefits of &lt;em&gt;connecting &lt;/em&gt;with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managers must recognize these moments not as isolated crises but as transitional phases requiring adaptive support — both emotional and structural. This does not mean lowering expectations, but making appropriate accommodations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put another way, managers here do not need to reduce standards but rather enable individuals to meet the standards and work expectations, but perhaps in new ways, until the necessary work and business of the firm can be accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflection points often hold special power because they usually entail shifts in identity: very independent people may&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/ways-you-make-world-better-when-ask-for-help"&gt; need to learn to ask for help&lt;/a&gt;, while the more resilient and stoic presenting individuals might need to show vulnerability. Caregivers become patients, providers need support, and high performers may need to downshift. These changes can cause shame, internal conflict, and silence — especially in workplaces that reward stoicism in leaders and managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, health inflection points are entangled with other stressors — financial expenses, the strain of uncertainty, and grief around losing abilities and control, and just dealing with change. For example, postpartum depression or long-term caregiving may go unacknowledged yet fundamentally affect workplace performance and family dynamics. Employees often mask these issues, which can lead to an increased emotional and physical toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When individuals fall ill, families, colleagues, and friends often absorb the fallout, which can be an additional burden on the employee struggling with illness. Their children and their partners will have to do more emotional and physical labor and may need to adjust their work schedules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this context, managers should consider how support can expand beyond the individual to encompass their context and view the entire family as the caregiving unit. The question then becomes, “How do we best go about it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/scenarios-sound-familiar-relationship-wildly-unhealthy"&gt;If These 5 Scenarios Sound Familiar, Your Relationship Is Wildly Unhealthy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When instincts take over&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The place to start is with ourselves. When confronted with an employee in distress, managers tend not to consult policy manuals immediately but instead rely on instinct, which is often based on their lived experiences, personalities, and fears. This can lead to jumping to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our book identified default &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://carinisabelknoop.medium.com/hyena-or-kangaroo-know-your-archetype-to-better-support-struggling-employees-and-yourself-58b3ea3f06c1" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;animal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; archetypes in managerial responses when mental illness issues surface in persons or in teams. They apply just as clearly to chronic illness as they do to mental health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some default to the Ostrich, practicing benign ignorance. They keep their heads down, hoping the problem will resolve itself. Their discomfort with vulnerability leads them to avoid conversations until the issue becomes unavoidable. Often, it becomes harder to manage and even harder for the employee to divulge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others become Kangaroos, carrying their struggling team member close, over-accommodating, or shielding them from challenge. While motivated by care or shared experience, this approach can disempower and demoralize the employee, who is struggling to preserve autonomy and agency, and it can destabilize the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hyena manager, consciously or not, shifts into a “protect the pack” mindset. They may sideline or pressure the unwell employee to leave, rationalizing it as being in the best interest of performance or morale. But this often communicates that being imperfect means being expendable. The Snake waits until a mistake justifies action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, we would be a Platypus, unusual, adaptive, and rare. This manager blends curiosity with care and pragmatism with perception. They listen for signals rather than stories, ask how they can help before making assumptions, and respond with flexibility grounded in structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As managers, considering the impact of chronic illness invites us to redesign for the reality of managing humans for the unpredictability and unevenness of the human body and spirit as they truly are. This is about diversity, inclusion, and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If managers and workplaces can support those of us living on altered maps, they might be better equipped for everyone navigating the detours of life we have written about over the years — be it &lt;a href="https://carinisabelknoop.medium.com/how-extending-a-hand-to-employee-caregivers-helps-them-and-the-firm-and-some-lessons-from-an-af9f31760350" rel="nofollow"&gt;caregiving&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://carinisabelknoop.medium.com/lost-in-transition-how-understanding-loss-supports-workplace-well-being-for-all-e3338cf20fcc" rel="nofollow"&gt;grief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://carinisabelknoop.medium.com/the-burnout-puzzle-the-role-of-expectations-boundaries-and-ego-c5f99d71e01d" rel="nofollow"&gt;burnout&lt;/a&gt;, parenting, neurodiversity, or plain exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/family/bride-uninvites-chronically-ill-sister-wedding"&gt;Bride Wonders If She's Wrong For Uninviting Her Chronically Ill Sister — 'I'm Sick Of Her Stealing The Spotlight'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to lead when the map has changed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting employees with chronic illness means redesigning systems with variability in mind. Sometimes, productivity, like health, comes in waves, not on fixed timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than asking employees to explain or justify their conditions, managers can focus on listening for signals: subtle shifts in behavior, energy, or engagement that may indicate the need for adjustment. When someone says they need to work differently, the most helpful question is, “How can we support that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, organizations have not always been successful in building career paths that accommodate rerouting, for example, for employees who are parenting and caregiving. Employees may need to pause, slow down, or shift directions entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also important to remember that individuals disclose when the environment feels safe, not when they are told to “bring their whole selves to work.” Today, for the most part, most of us feel that we can bring our whole selves to work as long as we present as healthy. Asking someone to “just be honest” is cruel if honesty costs them their career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaders can help by modeling imperfection themselves and being transparent about the tradeoffs of high performance. Insufficient leave, lack of flexible scheduling, and persistent stigma around health-related vulnerability hinder employees’ ability to recover and contribute. Even when laws exist (e.g., the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Pregnancy Discrimination Act), cultural signals often suppress help-seeking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/art-letting-go-habits-naturally-tranquil-people"&gt;The Art Of Letting Go: 3 Simple Habits Of Naturally Tranquil People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The gifts of a wounded traveler&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chronic illness can limit what we do on a given day, it often expands &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we do it and how we see others doing it, too. The workplace tends to frame illness in terms of risk: absenteeism, lowered output, and cost. However, like neurodivergence, experiencing and managing chronic conditions can also cultivate capacities that align with what teams and leaders supposedly need the most today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illness sharpens time awareness and forces prioritization. Many of us become &lt;em&gt;radically organized&lt;/em&gt; because we have no choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When energy comes in limited units, we learn to protect it, map it, allocate it with care, and triage what matters, what can wait, and what needs help. And who needs help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illness also strips away pretense. It makes us &lt;em&gt;vulnerable&lt;/em&gt; for sure, but not fragile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It teaches us to ask for help, to receive support, and to notice subtle cues in others. These are core leadership skills: humility, attunement, and relational intelligence. In managing a body that betrays expectations, we become more aware of what others are carrying and more willing to accommodate differences without demanding explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And perhaps most powerfully, chronic illness often deepens empathy. We may be short-tempered sometimes because we are in physical and mental pain, but we will also be more empathetic and understanding of others presenting with differences. We may become more patient with these differences, more skilled at navigating ambiguity, and more courageous in trying to reach out to address the imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, chronic illness teaches us that change and life are not always gradual, fair, or predictable. It allows us to lead and support others with greater sensitivity, especially in times of organizational transition, personal loss, or systems in flux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, your body works the way you expect. The next, it does not.  And in that reckoning, many of us must develop comfort with uncertainty, navigating life with less entitlement and more realism and resilience. Not everyone gets what they need and want. Not everyone starts from the same baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illness makes visible what is true for many marginalized people at work and in society: that effort and outcome are not always proportionate. What is “equal” on paper may not be equitable in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as organizations are learning to recognize the assets of neurodivergent talent — such as pattern recognition and creative thinking — they must also learn to recognize what employees with chronic illnesses bring. Like caregivers who feel supported and understood, we can also bring perspective, focus, and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/simple-habits-people-refuse-shame-themselves-practice-every-single-day"&gt;5 Simple Habits People Who Refuse to Shame Themselves Practice Every Single Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Driving with pain in the passenger seat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those living with conditions like mine, the path is not broken, but it is different. If you manage or love one of us, please understand this: Some of us are always driving with pain in the passenger seat, bad shocks, or blurred mirrors — and sometimes, we look out for death approaching in the rearview mirror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/signs-man-doesnt-love-just-loves-fixing-you"&gt;are not asking to be rescued or fixed&lt;/a&gt;. We are asking for room to move forward, in the ways that we still can, perhaps sometimes sideways, and be accepted as we are. Still capable and very human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And perhaps special in different ways, too. To extend our metaphor, chronic illness changes not only the map, but also the travelers. And in that change, we may discover paths worth following, not just for ourselves but for everyone seeking their way.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common and often debilitating condition that affects millions of older adults, causing pain and stiffening of the knee joint. Treatment often includes anti-inflammatory drugs, which are linked to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers examined the current evidence on non-drug therapies for treating KOA. They looked at data from 139 clinical trials involving nearly 10,000 people to compare 12 different non-drug treatments. These included laser therapy, electrical stimulation, braces, insoles, kinesiology tape, water-based therapy, exercise, and ultrasound. By combining results from all these studies into a powerful network meta-analysis, the team could rank the therapies based on how well they worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knee braces came out on top across most categories, including reducing pain, improving function, and relieving stiffness. Hydrotherapy -- exercises or treatments performed in warm water -- was particularly effective at easing pain and general exercise was also consistently effective, improving both pain and physical function. High-intensity laser therapy and shock wave therapy showed some benefits, while ultrasound consistently scored the lowest in effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors caution that differences in study design, small sample sizes, and variability in treatment duration between the 139 included studies may limit the precision of the rankings. However, they conclude that physical therapy has promising effects on KOA, offering potential treatments without the risks of anti-inflammatory drugs. Future studies should examine the clinical efficacy of combined therapies, as well as their cost-effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors add: "Knee braces, hydrotherapy, and exercise are the most effective non-drug therapies for knee osteoarthritis. They reduce pain and improve mobility without the gastrointestinal or cardiovascular risks linked to common pain medications. Patients and clinicians should prioritize these evidence-based options."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our analysis of nearly 10,000 patients reveals that simple, accessible therapies like knee bracing and water-based exercise outperform high-tech options like ultrasound. This could reshape clinical guidelines to focus on safer, lower-cost interventions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to the Louisiana Department of Health, people typically become infected either by exposing open wounds to contaminated water or by eating raw or undercooked seafood, especially oysters (pictured)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

Clinical Trial Finds Oral Semaglutide Works For Weight Loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: people in the surgery group shed an average of 25.7 percent of their total body weight over two years, while those in the medication group lost 5.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's partly down to patients not sticking to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-supplements-dietitian-reveals-truth-about-glp-1-imitations"&gt;their GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt;, whereas surgery is more permanent, but the researchers also noticed smaller differences over shorter time frames – the surgery always gave the best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165321" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165321" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-642x428.jpg" alt="Ozempic Isn't Actually The Most Effective Option For Weight Loss, Scientists Confirm" class="wp-image-165321 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165321" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Semaglutide mimics the body's natural GLP-1 hormone. (aprott/iStock/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; show weight loss between 15 percent and 21 percent for GLP-1s, but this study suggests that weight loss in the real world is considerably lower even for patients who have active prescriptions for an entire year," &lt;a href="https://asmbs.org/news_releases/head-to-head-study-shows-bariatric-surgery-superior-to-glp-1-drugs-for-weight-loss/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; NYU surgical resident Avery Brown when the results were &lt;a href="https://www.soard.org/article/S1550-7289(25)00188-1/fulltext"&gt;presented in June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know as many as 70 percent of patients may discontinue treatment within one year. GLP-1 patients may need to adjust their expectations, adhere more closely to treatment or opt for metabolic and bariatric surgery to achieve desired results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that the study was funded by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), who would have a vested interest in promoting surgical options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers aren't outright dismissing semaglutide treatments, which also showed beneficial results in this study. With &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-coverage-of-and-spending-on-glp-1s/"&gt;GLP-1 prescriptions doubling&lt;/a&gt; from 2022 to 2023, it's crucial to investigate how they compare to established &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/as-well-as-weight-loss-studies-find-bariatric-surgery-also-lowers-the-risk-of-developing-cancer"&gt;surgery methods&lt;/a&gt;, and to figure out which options are best for each individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs remain much more popular than surgery, but people &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.57349"&gt;don't often&lt;/a&gt; stick to taking them. Meanwhile, only a small percentage of people eligible for surgery choose it as an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss isn't the only benefit that can come from Ozempic. The drug was originally approved to treat type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="174929" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, because it helps lower blood sugar levels, and studies have shown it can also reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-and-similar-drugs-lower-cancer-risks-study-suggests"&gt;the risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-could-be-good-for-your-heart-even-if-you-dont-lose-weight"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. In this study, bariatric surgery was associated with even better blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174931" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174931" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RaspberryAndSugarOnSpoon.jpg" alt="A spoonful of white sugar with a raspberry on top" class="size-medium wp-image-174931" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RaspberryAndSugarOnSpoon.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RaspberryAndSugarOnSpoon-578x415.jpg 578w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RaspberryAndSugarOnSpoon-600x431.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174931" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Bariatric surgery was associated with better blood sugar control compared to semaglutide.

Though safe, the procedures are invasive, permanent, and still require patients to stick to strict diet and exercise routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In future studies we will aim to identify what healthcare providers can do to optimize GLP-1 outcomes, identify which patients are better treated with bariatric surgery versus GLP-1s, and determine the role out-of-pocket costs play in treatment success," &lt;a href="https://asmbs.org/news_releases/head-to-head-study-shows-bariatric-surgery-superior-to-glp-1-drugs-for-weight-loss/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Karan Chhabra, a bariatric surgeon at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2025.04.008"&gt;was presented&lt;/a&gt; at the ASMBS annual meeting 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was first published in June 2025&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            Relentless coughing echoes through the Mumbai suburb of Govandi, where families live cramped under tarpaulin and salvaged wood. The narrow lanes are waterlogged and airless, and here in India’s financial capital, a deadly disease is lurking at every door.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00023b6n25b91lcs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors on the ground estimate that tuberculosis has infiltrated almost every second home of this eastern urban compound, killing residents and robbing many families of their livelihoods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00033b6nnu1zmfao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The local crisis is a microcosm of a national health care crisis. India is home to 27% of the world’s TB cases and records an average of two deaths related to the infectious disease every three minutes, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00043b6nbvychuyw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The government has pledged to eliminate the disease by the end of this year – but experts say that goal is dangerously out of reach – with health care system gaps and socioeconomic barriers stalling efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00053b6nvjzjc39w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mehboob Sheikh was diagnosed with TB six months ago – more than a decade after his wife died of the disease. For him, the realities of living with it are far too real.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00063b6n8bthxau0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I have lost a lot of weight, I can barely walk now, and I get breathless if I speak more,” he told CNN, his gaunt face and hollow eyes symptoms of his plight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00073b6nopspmjmb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The disease has already cost him his job at a printing press – the relentless fatigue and weakness left him unable to cope with the long shifts on his feet. Sheikh has been on an extended nine-month course of antibiotics, but with just three months of that treatment left, his body is still frail. Any sign of a recovery is hard to see.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00083b6nhyumxvhz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His children – malnourished, vulnerable and too young to understand – hover around while he coughs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00093b6nuarb1zbw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once earning 15,000 rupees ($171) a month, he now struggles to pay their school fees.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000a3b6nzn5hy9uj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If my body holds on, I will keep living. If not… that’s the end.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000c3b6new5jxoos@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stunned global health circles by pledging to eliminate TB by 2025 – five years ahead of the WHO’s global target. Elimination means cutting new TB cases by 80% and deaths by 90% compared with 2015 levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000d3b6nh0lwb48s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts viewed the government’s 2025 target as a monumental challenge, and just months ahead of the deadline, TB remains one of India’s most stubborn public health crises.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000e3b6n90u00ghl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            India’s struggle with the disease, experts say, is fueled by a potent combination of biology, poverty and systemic health care gaps.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000f3b6n2mc2lbdo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are a high-burden nation,” said Dr. Lancelot Pinto, an expert in lungs and the respiratory system, in Mumbai. “We do not necessarily have all the resources in place to scale up and eliminate TB by 2025.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000g3b6nxr7na6qa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The bacteria that causes the disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has haunted humanity for millennia, with traces found in Egyptian mummies. It can remain dormant inside the body for years and develop resistance to drugs, making it difficult to eradicate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000h3b6nozzip998@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The disease thrives in India’s densely populated, impoverished pockets, where people have little access to consistent medical care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000i3b6ntri1juga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After 10 years working in Govandi, health worker Pramila Pramod says the number of TB patients she sees every month has remained the same.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000j3b6nh3zbqmrj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The suburb’s alleys create the perfect transmission pathway, with no cross-ventilation, open drains clogged with garbage, and families of six huddled in single rooms. Fear of social stigma means some patients hide diagnoses from neighbors, schools, even spouses.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000k3b6nhu2fc6a0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sometimes there is a young girl of marriage age. (Her) parents won’t tell anyone she has TB,” said Pramod, who volunteers at Alert India, a non-governmental organization that works with people affected by infectious diseases. “How will they find a boy for her otherwise?” she recalls them asking.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000l3b6njsmvsc8m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This vulnerability is exacerbated by a struggling health care system where the public sector is plagued by decades of underinvestment, staff shortages and outdated facilities. The country’s vast but unregulated private sector, while providing essential and crucial services, can be costly to access.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000m3b6nv7km97cp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            India’s diagnostic strategy is another major hurdle. Nearly three-quarters of diagnoses still depend on sputum microscopy, a method first introduced around 140 years ago, that can miss active cases. The more modern molecular tests – which accurately detect the bacteria’s DNA – are used in a little over 1 in 4 diagnoses, according to Pinto.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000n3b6nbvt13dwn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This gap means countless infections go untreated and dangerous, drug-resistant strains spread undetected. “So, unless we detect and treat proactively – not just wait for symptoms – we’ll continue to miss cases,” Pinto said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000p3b6ntnifxi4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chest aches, fevers, debilitating headaches and chills pained 15-year-old Sufiya Syed for more than a year before doctors finally diagnosed her two months ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000q3b6nnq484e2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As TB took over her body, her weight dropped from 88 pounds to 55 pounds (40 kilograms to 25 kilograms). During that time, she still went to school. Now, she says she can’t focus on her studies, with nausea and sleepless nights leaving her body struggling to battle the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000r3b6ntw3j99uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every day when I wake up, I feel like I am going faint and completely black out,” she said. “Sometimes I don’t have food for four or five days. My mom forces me to eat.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000s3b6n2yrc9y47@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The government has ramped up efforts by offering free TB testing and medicines through public health facilities, aiming to ensure early diagnosis and treatment, reaching even the most vulnerable populations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000t3b6ngjxjn6zs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some progress has been made.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000u3b6nadcynh42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            India has reduced cases by 17.7% since 2015, nearly double the global average decline, and deaths have dropped from 28 to 22 per 100,000 people, according to data from India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000v3b6nv2r0lbc9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But with just months to go until the government’s end-of-2025 deadline, its promise is unraveling.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000w3b6nxp9i5k89@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Major challenges, including a shortage of staff to maintain comprehensive treatment, vulnerability in mapping in high-risk areas and poor health-seeking behavior, have allowed the disease to persist, according to a 2023 parliamentary report on the government’s eradication push.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000x3b6nxsvxr7r7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Covid-19 pandemic worsened matters. Lockdowns halted screenings, disrupted medicine supplies and diverted health workers, the report said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q000y3b6nl16v3vmh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CNN has contacted the Indian government’s Directorate General of Health Services for a response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00103b6n4vsf2ofq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For years, diagnosing TB in India’s remote communities has been a losing race against time, where vast distances to clinics, a chronic shortage of radiologists and a reliance on outdated sputum tests meant infections festered undetected, often until they were dangerously advanced.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00113b6ncv194mpp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since 1998, USAID filled some of the gap in India’s TB fight, channeling more than $140 million to fund grassroots networks in the nation’s hardest-to-reach corners. But recent US funding cuts have threatened to unravel these hard-won gains.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00123b6nfbtjat3n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While not publicly acknowledging the shortfall, India has boosted domestic budgets and is deploying an arsenal of new tools, including AI-powered X-rays, mobile testing vans and drones ferrying samples.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00133b6nli72jkte@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to speed up the fight against TB. Tools like Qure.ai’s chest X-ray software can rapidly scan lung images and flag patients who may have active TB – a critical step in countries where trained radiologists are scarce.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00143b6nhurzzky0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Confirmatory tests that analyze sputum or detect TB at the molecular level are more accurate, but they require labs, equipment, and time – resources often unavailable in slums and rural India. Integrated in portable machines, AI-powered X-rays help bridge that gap by flagging potential TB cases, allowing health workers to quickly refer those patients for confirmatory tests, reducing delays that often cost lives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00153b6nqeeo2gll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health experts caution, however, that the scans do not diagnose TB or reveal whether the disease is drug-sensitive or drug-resistant. Instead, they function as a screening and triage tool – catching cases earlier, reducing the number missed by basic symptom checks, and ensuring that patients are referred for proper sputum or molecular testing before starting treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00163b6nro7o5snn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That speed and reach matter in India, the world’s most populated country, where crowded living conditions make early detection crucial to stopping the spread of TB.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00173b6nvuibursv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These machines weigh less than 3.5 kilos and can be carried in a backpack,” said Qure.ai’s chief medical officer for global health, Dr. Shibu Vijayan. “They run on batteries, so you can screen an entire community in one day without needing power.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00183b6nlt45xe4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The devices are making it easier to reach people who might otherwise fall through the cracks. In the capital Delhi, for instance, the Clinton Health Access Initiative has deployed more than 30 backpack-sized machines in harder-to-access areas, and hundreds more across the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q00193b6n9e5jzzf0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know that certain groups are most vulnerable – slum dwellers, migrant workers, people exposed to dust,” Vijayan said. “The tiny X-rays make it possible to offer them tests in their community settings.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q001a3b6ngls770iy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cost is another breakthrough: the portable units are half the price of traditional hospital X-ray machines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q001b3b6ny50fj4ly@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Indian government has embraced the approach, incorporating AI screening into its national strategy. It has performed nearly 5 million X-rays with the devices, according to Vijayan, and officials are procuring additional devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q001c3b6nm5o1pxzz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Having the target and getting things aligned is as important as meeting the deadline itself,” Pinto said. “As long as it’s leading us in the right direction, we should consider these small victories as victories and push harder.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q001d3b6n64z38t63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But for people like Sheikh, there is little to celebrate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q001e3b6nor5mnipq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He continues his free treatment at a government hospital every month, with his son helping to bring his medicines home. But the help ends there. He says he has not received any monthly cash assistance that TB patients qualify for as part of a federal government program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf7tsh1q001f3b6now2jbajq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No one has come to help us,” he said. “I have no money left. I have to support and feed myself while I am alive.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Notice the little things. Are they repeating questions? Avoiding friends? Struggling with bills? Having open, compassionate conversations is the first step. Encourage them to see a doctor, and remember that Alzheimer’s doesn’t just affect one person it affects the whole family. Awareness and support make the journey less isolating.&lt;br&gt;Alzheimer’s often sneaks in quietly, disguised as everyday forgetfulness or moodiness. That’s why families need to stay alert to the first signs of Alzheimer’s disease. The more we talk about it, the easier it becomes to spot and address. On this World Alzheimer’s Day, let’s commit not just to raising awareness, but to really noticing the little things in the people we love. Because catching Alzheimer’s early isn’t just about treatment, it’s about giving families time, options, and hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 23:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8gFBVV95cUxNQXV4RnRDMlc4ZG9mb01pRTVCMzZ4bjMtSDBmY0dTanl3elNheXFWdUItTmhVS3BjTVRFc0RKak9JdkF5YWdEWEF4YXZlTE9UeC14dHVackpKLXN5NVRZZXpyNTBQRWdRY0FfU1BPc2tyMld1cktXMmZtaDZsY2dBeWI2R21tYm5kdHJKeVZqa0pOY0x5SVl6TG93MElJTTktWTVyUVdtVlAtbGZ4c1paMkd2YUQ4OXoyeTYzMnFVVm84M3VndGNDNVZfQWdRYzFFVGdLM1dmcWZDSENzVWtWQVZZZDlISGx4dG9lVThEU2VhZ9IB-gFBVV95cUxObklfeUV1b2RLTGlJdkdOdGRuU1RjZkpLZzR4cHZEZUJSRmUyTi03MFU1OWVVN0l4bU51OWJZM2x2bE9xTl84aFU3RWN0Wng3TENDOFRud0p1SDNYMTJtZnJITmVwUDFqcUVPVVRjU0JaRzlUZ2huVVlGTC16bTBDZ0NmMmRtSXpBa1o1Y25DYUl5Vzdfd1pua2h2VGFza0tkSVZteE1DRGhPeTVPN2EtRHY3dTZ6NDg0QXpwZTJfdEg0WkdIdDVYNW1qMDF4T0tOajMwSTBuNEtocXMwX0oyWlpMSEU2RVkyd1BFV3liZjZJczJlUHFjb05n</guid></item><item><title>兄弟姐妹想要一个和平的假期，但当他哥哥的鲁莽行为让他生病时，他质疑他是否想完全远离他- TwistedSifter</title><link>https://twistedsifter.com/2025/09/sibling-wanted-a-peaceful-vacation-but-when-his-brothers-reckless-behavior-got-him-sick-he-questioned-whether-he-wanted-to-pull-away-from-him-entirely/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family vacations have the power to mend old wounds, but they also can just open them wider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mm-player"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One young man was looking forward to a relaxing getaway, but when he suspects his brother &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mvk978/aita_for_going_lowcontact_with_my_brother_for/"&gt;gets him sick on purpose&lt;/a&gt; just to ruin his fun, he begins to question if he wants his brother in his life at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on for the full story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;AITA for going low-contact with my brother for deliberately getting me sick?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (21M) was recently on a family vacation with my brother “Linus” (19M).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About halfway through the trip, he got sick but refused to wear a mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also refused to take any other precautions around his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He kept doing things like drinking from my drinks without asking me, even though he knew he was sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I got sick to the point that I couldn’t enjoy much of the vacation because I was stuck in bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To him, this was the final straw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am just done with Linus’ rude and entitled behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be off at college this year and am planning on going low—maybe even no—contact with him over his lack of respect for other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, his family accuses him of overreacting, but he doesn’t feel like he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But my family is acting like I’m being unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AITA?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s determined to make sure his health is never collateral damage ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did Reddit think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like this commenter has cut their family members off for a similar reason.&lt;/p&gt;

And I'm far from alone - creatine has become the supplement of choice for millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Originally known for enhancing the performance of bodybuilders and athletes in the 1990s, this white powder is now entering the spice cupboards (well, that's where I store mine) of women in their 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It's arguably one of the world's most researched supplements. Thousands of studies have been carried out over the past few decades evaluating its ability to increase muscle mass and overall strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Creatine has become so big, you feel that if you are not using it, you are kind of losing out," says Dr Henry Chung, a lecturer in sport and exercise science at the University of Essex. "It's moved from elite sport into the mainstream. It's not about whether to take it anymore, it's about when to take it - before or after exercise? Everyday? How much?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"In which form is best? Powder, tablets, gummies?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Creatine is a naturally occurring compound which is stored in our muscles, and helps our cells produce energy. It is a vital component in the ATP-CP system, the fastest, most powerful energy system in our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It fuels the first 10-20 seconds in high intensity workouts - giving that quick, powerful burst of energy. From lifting weights to sprinting round the track, research suggests &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28615996/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;creatine supplementation can help improve performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;And away from the gym, there is a growing, but still relatively limited, body of evidence to suggest it can also help with our&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39070254/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt; short-term memory, mood and focus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Creatine supplements have become popular across different sports&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So, can this supplement improve our ability to think, remember and respond?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;And for me, and many others, will it help clear our brain fog, a catch-all term that describes an inability to think clearly, string a sentence together, and remember the simplest of things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For some people with serious post-viral conditions, brain fog can be longer term and potentially life-changing. If you have concerns, it is best to seek medical help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For most, brain fog is usually temporary and can happen because of an illness or certain types of medical treatment. For millions of women, it can be a symptom of the perimenopause, due to hormonal fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Katie Mansell believes creatine has helped in many parts of her life. The 46-year-old from Merseyside lifts weights, runs 30-40 miles a week, has a full-on job as the chief financial officer of a software company, and a busy home life with a teenage son and two dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"A few months ago, I was out of sorts. I was finding training really hard work and I was struggling to focus on things," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It was my friend who recommended it - she said it was a game changer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Katie, who is also perimenopausal, started taking six grams of creatine a day three months ago, and is beginning to feel a difference. Her mood feels a bit lighter, she can lift heavier weights and the fog that had descended on her brain has started to lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I've got more motivation to do things, especially when it comes to training. I feel stronger when I'm lifting and bouldering, and I can also think more clearly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Katie does caveat this - she's also on magnesium supplements and has started on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but she's confident that creatine is making an impact and will continue with her daily dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Katie Mansell says she has felt herself become stronger since she started taking creatine three months ago&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There are others who believe it's made little difference and there is divided opinion on whether the majority of us get the amount of creatine we need through our diets. Katie, who is a vegetarian, says she was probably missing out. While it's understood our bodies produce one gram of it naturally, the rest comes from high-protein food like meat and fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The supplement's impact on male athletes has been documented since the early 1990s but, as with a lot of scientific research, female biology was missing from the equation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I used to have to guess what my female athletes needed," explains Dr Susan Kleiner, a high-performance nutritionist from the US state of Washington. "All the research was based on men."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It wasn't until a few years ago that women's hormonal fluctuations were taken into account, says Dr Kleiner, an adviser on the board of Creatine Health, a global initiative set up to promote research on the supplement. "And that was when scientists started to see a real impact in other parts of the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Instead of just concentrating on how creatine interacts with our muscles in a sport setting, scientists have begun to discover how it could potentially affect reproductive health, bone health and brain function - all of which can be affected during perimenopause, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So does that mean that creatine can help my brain fog?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"That's an interesting thought," says Professor Emeritus Trevor McMorris. "It might do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Having been in the field for more than 40 years, he has carried out many studies into creatine supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He says perimenopausal brain fog could have a similar impact to sleep deprivation, something he has researched extensively, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16416332/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;finding that high doses of creatine could mitigate the effects of too little sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;When people use the supplement, the brain may - like other muscles in the body - increase its stores of creatine. This helps produce more energy, which could help improve memory and the ability to process information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But Prof McMorris say it won't work for everyone. His most recent research suggests &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432824001384?via%3Dihub=" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;people need to be under a level of stress&lt;/a&gt; - for example, being sleep deprived or not having enough creatine in their diet - for it to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So, in short, when it comes to helping me with my brain fog - maybe - there's potential. The experts I have spoken to believe it's an "an exciting time" in this line of research, but that more studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Dietician Lucy Upton warns that we could start to see more side effects to creatine use because of the supplement's surge in popularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"While there is extensive research, that has been in a controlled environment," she says. "Now we need to think about the variation of body sizes, doses and any pre-existing conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Currently, known side effects are the risk of stomach upset, muscle cramps and bloating. People with conditions affecting their kidneys should consult a doctor before taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;While Dr Chung sees no harm in healthy adults "trying it out", he also says results tend to be "minimal gains", adding that "it is not, by any means, a wonder drug".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;As for me, I started taking the creatine in my cupboard but stopped after a month (blame it on the brain fog). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Perhaps I'll give it another try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 23:02:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1IcmwtaGltcHhLVFNfYW01WnBEUjJIcFVRRks3UlV1a1RCRVRveU9FRUxoR2puMEpjQzFTUW9lVGtmZ0Y3NU9tVFp0Y29GOUxseno0SVg5aVB1d9IBX0FVX3lxTE9helltajhEQk1wSzZQSjhvcmVJZG5QMG5TUGs4NkpSYkdiQTN6cjh5UVV5aWUwMGFsTnVfQ2ZINkx2Y0N5M290R2pxYWx5RG5zRHhvQVA0OXF3R2I4OC1Z</guid></item><item><title>28岁的影响者说，她从计划婚礼到面对无法治愈的脑癌- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/28-old-influencer-says-she-220623149.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty (2)&lt;/p&gt; CT scan on computer monitor (stock image); bride-to-be trying on wedding dresses (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One influencer is opening up about her cancer diagnosis and how it has impacted her life, including everything from wedding planning to fertility&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shinae Ann, a 28-year-old YouTuber and TikToker from Australia, first shared in a September social media video that she had been diagnosed with an incurable grade 2 astrocytoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have high hopes," she told 9Honey.

She shared in a TikTok that she and her fiancé ultimately opted to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shinaeann/photo/7550250653168291090?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:postpone their nuptials;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;postpone their nuptials&lt;/a&gt; from April 2026 to later in the year, as they weren't sure where her cancer treatment would take them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to Australian outlet &lt;a href="https://honey.nine.com.au/latest/shinae-ann-the-bizarre-symptom-that-led-to-her-brain-cancer-diagnosis-mor/35f477b5-c1bd-4fe9-8952-5ac23f179931" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:9Honey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;9Honey&lt;/a&gt; about the day she found out about her tumor, Shinae recalled driving home from breakfast when a friend called her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I saw her calling me, I thought I'd just pull up, chat to her and go into the [garage] afterwards," Shinae shared, recalling how she opted to park on the street outside her home so she could have better cell reception. "I'm really glad that I made that decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Patient undergoing an MRI (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The influencer recalled suddenly seeing visions in her right eye, and being unable to open the car door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Something was not right. I didn't know where I was," she recalled to 9Honey. "I said to my friend, 'Something is wrong with me.' That's when I started to freak out."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shinae's fiancé, Sebastain, was at home at the time, and jumped into action after her friend alerted him to the situation taking place outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He had no idea how severe it was until he said he saw me," Shinae said. "He said I just looked at him with terror in my eyes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it took her nearly a minute to open the car door and let her fiancé inside, the pair sped to the hospital as soon as they could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they arrived at a small private hospital, Shinae began having a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's when the doctors came and started helping immediately," she recalled. "They helped get me to the public hospital, where I've had the rest of my treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An MRI and CT scans showed that she had a brain tumor, and surgeons scheduled her for an operation to remove as much of it as possible, as well as a biopsy, later that week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They didn't know if it was cancerous, they didn't know what type it was or anything," she explained to 9Honey. Doctors quickly diagnosed Shinae with a cancerous astrocytoma, and told her that it was considered incurable because of where it's located in her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's made its way into important parts of my brain that would affect speech, memory and eyesight, so that they can't remove the tumour, which is why I'll probably have it for forever," Shinae said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My dad had also had a seizure a few weeks before me, so we already had a lot going on in our family," she added. "That's kind of when it hit me that I'm actually really unwell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the influencer, she plans to go through radiation and chemotherapy, "but even if they can kill the cancer cells and I go into remission, since the tumor is still there, it's inevitable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cancer will come back at some point," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Patient in hospital bed (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the difficult diagnosis, Shinae has been candid about wanting to put on a brave face and fight. On her &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shinaeann/video/7551208302567279893?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; account, she has detailed undergoing fertility treatments to attempt to freeze embryos and have children in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel like I'm quite a resilient person, I just feel like at some point I'm like, well, there's nothing that I can do about it so I may as well get on with it," she said. "I don't really dwell on the negatives too much; I always try to look for the positives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has also taken time to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shinaeann/video/7544531808428297479?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:advocate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;advocate&lt;/a&gt; for other young people to undergo regular medical checkups, as she experienced migraines for years before her tumor was discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All it would've taken was getting an MRI three or five years ago and we would've known about [the tumor]," Shinae told 9Honey. "You know yourself the best, if you have a feeling that there's something wrong. I think it's important to push for yourself. Say, 'I think I want to get an MRI done.' Just take yourself a little bit more seriously because I didn't."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for her future, Shinae said, "I have high hopes. I have youth on my side. I'm healthy, so I'm going to do everything on my end to do as much as I can to still live a long, healthy life."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/28-year-old-influencer-went-from-planning-wedding-to-facing-brain-cancer-11814157" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 22:13:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTFBUQ2NIeWNSbUhucmFkcVNwRHk4YVIwbU81YmVLTGFKLWRRYmhiSUFJbFFDQWtmbktkQ01tcVhVRkNHeFlFU0VVOXF3Qkd5WnZSYjY3aE9mUjVxM05fNlRlNk5RQ2pPQkRBNW9MOXpDOUhzVmlieHQ0VXVR</guid></item><item><title>2025年世界老年痴呆症日：我们今天应该开始做的7件事，以保持60岁后的大脑健康-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/world-alzheimers-day-2025-7-things-we-should-start-doing-today-to-keep-our-brain-healthy-after-60/articleshow/124017971.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a year, World Alzheimer's Day helps to remind us how crucial brain health is, both to avoid memory-associated diseases but to lead a happy, independent life into old age. Though neurodegeneration is a factor, more and more science demonstrate that lifestyle decisions greatly impact how better or badly our brains age. And here's the good part—nowhere is too early or too late to take action. Below are seven practical, science-proven steps to start today to keep your mind fit long into your 60s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Remain physically active&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise increases blood circulation to the brain, decreases one's risk for hypertension and diabetes, and promotes development of new neural pathways. Walking briskly, swimming, riding a bicycle, or even yoga for 30 minutes daily can boost memory and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Scientists reveal that six minutes of high-intensity exercise could delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prioritize Quality Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is more than rest—time for brain repair. When we sleep profoundly, waste such as beta-amyloid, associated with Alzheimer's disease, is eliminated. Grown-ups should have 7–8 hours of continuous sleep a day to boost mood, attention, and future intellectual function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keep Learning, Keep Challenging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your brain is fueled by novelty. Learning a new language, a new instrument, crosswords, or even software increases neural links. Lifelong learning defers intellectual decline by building up what neuroscientists call a "cognitive reserve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eat a Brain-Friendly Diet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your diet directly affects brain health. There has been a demonstration that a Mediterranean diet rich in leafy greens, nuts, fatty fish, olive oil, and berries can slow down age-related decline. Cutting down consumption of packaged foods and refined sugar can protect against inflammation that destroys brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Handle Stress Well&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress accelerates brain ageing and impairs memory. Simple practices like meditation, mindfulness, deep breathing, or journaling can lower cortisol levels. Even ten minutes a day of mindful relaxation can protect brain cells from long-term damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cultivate Social Relationships&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia's quiet threat is loneliness. Conversation with others, visiting with family or a friend, or participation in community activities helps to maintain intellectual and emotional functioning. It is as good for your brain as exercise is for your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Be Aware of Health Status&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untreated diabetes, high blood pressure, overweight or obesity, and high cholesterol greatly accelerate intellectual decline. Regular visits to a doctor, early treatment, and lifestyle modifications protect the heart but also protect the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ultimate Conclusion Brain health is neither a prerogative of ripe old age; it is a continuous investment. Even small, consistent steps taken today can cumulatively make a vast impact by age 60. On account of today being World Alzheimer's Day, let's raise our awareness about the disease beyond being just observant; let's also educate ourselves to take preventive steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt; Ultimately, a healthier brain spells a better memory, better decision-making, and a better quality of life to come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;(Dr Khushboo Patel, Consultant – Neurology, Max Smart Super Hospital, Saket)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
