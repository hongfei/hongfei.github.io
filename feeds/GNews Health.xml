Whenever I have period cramps, pelvic pain or a stabbing sensation in my thighs I get scared that I will have another ruptured cyst."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since her diagnosis in 2023, Nina says everyday life has massively changed for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina said: "Living with endometriosis has changed my life entirely, it's taken away my favourite hobbies such as volleyball and it has placed a huge strain on my career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It effects my job and my productivity as there are days when I cannot leave my bed due to the pain. It really scares me that I could lose my job as each month I am absent due to the insufferable pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina says the biggest challenge she has faced since her diagnosis is how endometriosis has effected her fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina said: "I felt like my life fell apart as I had always dreamt of becoming a mum but with endometriosis it is likely that I will struggle to conceive naturally, so the freedom of choosing when I would like to be a mum has been taken away from me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis Action Month is calling for greater awareness towards the chronic condition, Nina believes knowledge of endometriosis is getting better but it can come with challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina said: "The diagnosis rate is getting better but it does mean more dedicated nurses within the NHS are needed to help women get the support they need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BloodyEndoMidlands is a charity supporting women suffering with endometriosis in the West Midlands region, you can visit their support group Facebook page and website online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="article-body-link" href="http://hellorayo.co.uk/hits-radio/play/" target="_blank"&gt;First for all the latest news from across the UK every hour on Hits Radio on DAB, at hitsradio.co.uk and on the Rayo app.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Rayo</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 06:32:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-wFBVV95cUxPdzFkS0dPUVhWeHVnTmwyLUNQb0NXRjB1UXc1MEVaWFhFb2IyR1FoazRrbFNsSFlLNklFZmljV3oycldSRUhVX1o2RnRtdTZ3VnNkLXk3R0UwczVLMjhoWWdBbE1UNTRXeGZRd1hPNXVIcjlJWkdROC1rVTA1Yl9wYW45OGlfXzV5ck1JMU13Tk1vOFFVMng4UlZJNl9ydktnYzR5NGtBZkxRenFHYi01OV94VUN5bm4ycHAtbVdOSktEM2NGTlFiZ1J4NnBsT2dYbXNRYlBNQjNwQnA5SEowQmtmVGxkN1p0dFljS2xVUTEyWkUybDBTbXdmVQ</guid></item><item><title>I'm a colon cancer doctor.

This graph shows the latest year for which data is available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 52,900 will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is also the second most common cause of cancer deaths around the world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Cancer Research UK, 44,063 cases are diagnosed per year, and the nation experiences 16,808 deaths every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show that in industrialized countries like the US and UK, early-onset colorectal cancer is increasing by two to four percent every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And since the 1990s, cancer statistics have shown that EOCRC (early-onset colorectal cancer) has increased by more than 50 percent, meaning it is the leading cause of cancer death in men and the second-leading cause in women under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer is most commonly found in the sigmoid colon, the lowest part of the colon just before the rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A survey conducted by the Colorectal Cancer Alliance revealed that young patients with EOCRC often experience changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea or constipation, unexplained weight loss, fatigue and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The biggest red flag, however, is blood in the stool, on the toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If blood is bright red, it's 'newer' or came from lower in the digestive tract, such as in the sigmoid colon or rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, if it's darker or black, it's 'older' and could have come from higher up in the colon or the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the main reasons colorectal cancer is diagnosed so late or dismissed in young people is these signs could be attributed to more benign and common conditions like hemorrhoids or irritable bowel syndrome.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, roughly half of all Americans will have hemorrhoids at least once in their life, and one in 10 will be diagnosed with IBS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although bright red rectal bleeding is commonly associated with hemorrhoids, the rising incidence of EOCRC means that any concerning symptoms in younger individuals should not be dismissed without further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This blood loss can also cause anemia, leading to fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Why is there a surge of cases in young people?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, diets rich in red and processed meats, sedentary behavior, and obesity, are well-documented risk factors for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year a study from Cleveland Clinic's Center for Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer shed some light on why processed meats such as deli ham, hot dogs and burgers can be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13746823/oncologist-discovery-record-colon-cancer-patients.html"&gt;colleague Dr Suneel Kamath&lt;/a&gt; and his team collected plasma samples from 64 patients with colorectal cancer and found young patients had higher levels of compounds called metabolites from red and processed meat in their blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We think these metabolites help feed cancer cells and hijack normal cells, causing tumors to grow while healthy cells are deprived of the energy they need to function normally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is also thought to be the case for alcohol.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for obesity, the latest science tells us that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14292265/body-fat-areas-higher-risk-colon-cancer-study.html"&gt;carrying more visceral fat around organs like the colon&lt;/a&gt; may create inflammation, which makes cancer cells more likely to form.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a significant proportion of young patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer do not fit this typical high-risk profile. Many are fit, have healthy diets, and do not exhibit common lifestyle risks like smoking or drinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This paradox points to the complexity of environmental exposures contributing to the disease, an active area of research that still comes with many unknowns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The concept of the 'exposome' - the total amount of environmental exposures that a person encounters during their lifetime - has emerged as a valuable framework for how genetic predisposition and the environment raise the risk of early-onset cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Teams like ours at the Cleveland Clinic are now trying to figure out which environmental factors contribute to the rise in colorectal cancer in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some research has already provided theories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A review from the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14202563/colon-cancer-explosion-toxins-air-link.html"&gt;University of California San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; of more than 3,000 studies found that microplastics can accumulate in the colon and cause it to produce less mucus, a protective layer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the colon can't produce mucus, the intestinal walls can't protect against contaminants like microplastics and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mucus also lubricates the colon and helps stool pass easily. When stool builds up in the colon, it irritates the colon and inflames the inner lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, much of this territory is still uncharted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Am I at risk?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Besides environmental risk factors that still need to be identified, there are several known inherited conditions that predispose patients to colorectal cancer at a young age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, about 15 to 20 percent of early-onset colorectal cases cases are attributed to hereditary conditions - those passed on through families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of these are related to Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lynch syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs when genes involved in DNA repair - mismatch repair genes - mutate. This significantly raises the risk of cells in organs like the colon growing out of control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC estimates one in 279 Americans has Lynch syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;FAP, meanwhile, causes the growth of numerous polyps that almost always lead to early-onset cancer if left untreated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people with a family history of these conditions, genetic testing and early and frequent screening, including colonoscopies, are critical in identifying and preventing colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, risk-reducing surgeries, like removing parts or even all of the colon, may be the best prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A family history of colorectal cancer, especially when in a first-degree relative, even without a known hereditary condition, doubles your overall risk, so it's crucial to know your history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A known family history of colorectal cancer may prompt genetic testing and potentially life-saving screening colonoscopies, even if you're younger than 45, the current recommended screening age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;How is colon cancer screened for and diagnosed?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer is crucial, as cancers detected in the early stages can often be cured with surgery alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unfortunately, early-onset colorectal cancer is frequently diagnosed at advanced stages because young people are more likely to ignore their symptoms or not be old enough for regular screenings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This complicates treatment and lowers survival rates. &lt;span&gt;When addressed early, the chances of successful treatment and cure are significantly higher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The good news in recent decades has been thanks to screening tools like colonoscopies and at-home stool tests, colon cancer rates are down in people over 65.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alarmingly these important gains were accompanied by a rise in cases and deaths in young people that are still below the age of recommended screening examinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colonoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This involves inserting a long tube with a camera on the end into the anus and passing it through the rectum and colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the doctor finds polyps during the exam, they will remove them and test them for cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends getting a colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 45, though this guideline fails to capture the growing number of patients in their 20s and 30s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At-home stool tests like Cologuard have also become increasingly popular, allowing people to take a sample of their stool and send it off to check for hidden blood for DNA changes, which could be a sign of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, if you get a positive stool test, you will likely still be referred for a colonoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;How is colon cancer treated?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treating young people with colon cancer requires special considerations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since hereditary conditions are more commonly found in young patients with cancer, any patient diagnosed with early-onset colon cancer should undergo genetic testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diagnosing genetic conditions like Lynch syndrome or FAP can have significant implications not only for the patient but for their relatives, as it could prevent further cancers in the family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Young patients with metastatic disease - meaning the cancer has spread to other areas - may benefit from aggressive treatment, including surgery to remove the primary tumor in the colon and also potential metastases in the liver or lung, but this must be balanced with a careful, individualized approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psychological care is also an essential part of treatment, as cancer at a young age can have profound emotional and social impacts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be very difficult for people who are used to being the primary caregivers in their families, taking care of young children and aging parents, to suddenly require care to be given to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Financial toxicity, which refers to the high costs associated with cancer treatment, is another challenge faced by many young patients who frequently do not have sufficient savings and are dependent on regular paychecks to make ends meet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Social work support is crucial in addressing these financial burdens and helping patients navigate the complexities of cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, since some cancer treatments can affect reproductive and sexual health, it is critical for EOCRC patients to discuss their plans for childbearing with their cancer provider and be referred to fertility specialists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike many patients traditionally diagnosed with colon cancer, these patients are focused on expanding their families, and we want to make sure they have every opportunity to do that.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The goal of my team is to optimize the quality of life for cancer survivors and provide ongoing support tailored to their unique needs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;What's the takeaway?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset colorectal cancer presents a significant public health challenge, driven by complex interactions between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preventing and reversing the rise of the disease in young people requires a deeper understanding of these influences and the implementation of personalized screening strategies, particularly for individuals with hereditary risks or a family history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early diagnosis is crucial to improving survival, and patients and healthcare providers need to be vigilant to prevent delays in detection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment must be tailored to the unique needs of younger patients through a multidisciplinary approach at expert centers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As innovative research continues to shed light on the causes of colon cancer in young people, a more comprehensive patient- and population-centered approach will not only improve outcomes but also help reduce the overall impact of this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When Catalonian &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Branyas"&gt;Maria Branyas&lt;/a&gt; died in August 2024 at the grand old age of 117 years and 168 days, she was officially the world's oldest living person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine how Maria managed to collect so many birthdays, a team led by researchers from the Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute in Spain conducted a comprehensive analysis on everything from her genes to her proteins to her microbiome to her metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their report, which is yet to be peer reviewed, provides a rare glimpse into the cellular machinery that just might give some of us a shot at starting a second centenary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155484" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155484" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642.jpg" alt="Maria at her 117th birthday" class="wp-image-155484 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155484" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Maria blowing out candles at her 117th birthday. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Branyas#/media/File:Maria_Branyas_Morera_(117%C3%A8_aniversari).jpg"&gt;Family archive of Maria Branyas Morera/Wikimedia Commons/PD&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria was a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercentenarian"&gt;supercentenarian&lt;/a&gt; – someone who reaches the age of 110 or urpasses it – and it's quite an achievement. Only around 1 in 10 of the people who make it to a century of living then manage another decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a host of different analytical techniques and interviews, the researchers found that Maria checked a lot of the recommended boxes when it came to longevity and healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155398" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155398" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart.jpg" alt="Multiomics chart" class="wp-image-155398 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart-416x415.jpg 416w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart-600x598.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155398" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at multiple signs of aging. (Santos-Pujol et al., &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a mentally, socially, and physically active lifestyle, for instance, spending quality time with family and friends; all factors known to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-social-life-could-help-you-stave-off-dementia-for-years-study-finds"&gt;keep dementia at bay&lt;/a&gt;. Maria also ate well, sticking mostly to a Mediterranean-style diet that's been linked &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mediterranean-lifestyle-really-can-help-you-live-longer-study-shows"&gt;to a longer lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing the researchers noted was Maria's love of yogurt. The researchers think the supercentenarian's diet choices helped to encourage healthy gut bacteria – and indeed her gut microbiome had the characteristics of someone much younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Microorganisms are critical in determining not only the metabolite composition of our body, but also inflammation, intestinal permeability, cognition, and bone and muscle health," &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations in our DNA have long been considered critical in determining our mortality. Maria had genes associated with a stronger immune system, protection against heart disease, and a reduction in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-risk-of-cancer-could-fluctuate-even-born-youre-born"&gt;risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also looked at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt;; a chemical marking mechanism that affects how genes are expressed. Since this mechanism is influenced by stresses in the environment, it is often used to gauge the passing of life's trials in what's described as our biological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Remarkably, all the distinct algorithms of age based on DNA methylation yielded the same result," &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our supercentenarian exhibited a much younger biological age than her real chronological age and this occurred in the three different tissues analyzed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other factors highlighted by the researchers were Maria's highly efficient metabolism, leading to lower levels &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-reveal-how-to-actually-lower-your-cholesterol"&gt;of 'bad' cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and higher levels of 'good' cholesterol, as well as low levels of inflammation (protecting against multiple health issues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20250310/genetico-maria-branyas-117-anos-microbiota-nina/16484198.shtml"&gt;Maria herself&lt;/a&gt; put her long life down to an "orderly life and pleasant surroundings", but it's clear that there were multiple factors at work. While most of us won't reach 117, the research does help in understanding how the body can be given the best chance of aging without damage or disease – and from there improving our health in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The picture that emerges from our study shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked and that both processes can be distinguished and dissected at the molecular level," &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, but is available on the preprint server &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;BioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"For as long as I can remember, every time I pee, my eyes tear up. I don’t mean just a little watery-eyed moment, I mean full-blown tears streaming down my face, sometimes even a runny nose. The longer I hold it, the worse it gets. I always assumed this happened to everyone. Growing up without the internet, there wasn’t exactly a way to fact-check my experience, and honestly, it never even crossed my mind to ask my family about it. It was just…normal. Then, one fateful day in high school, I hadn’t adjusted to my new schedule yet, so I went for two full class periods without a bathroom break. By the time I finally made it to the restroom, the floodgates (both kinds) opened. When I walked back into class, my friends looked alarmed."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“'Are you okay? Why were you crying?' one of them asked. Confused, I just shrugged. 'Oh, I wasn’t crying. I just really had to pee.' Apparently, this wasn’t a universal experience. No one in my friend group had any idea what I was talking about. In fact, they didn’t even believe me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, and thanks to the internet, I now know this rare phenomenon is called Gustatory Lacrimation. It’s a quirky little glitch in the nervous system where the body gets its wires crossed, making my tear ducts go into overdrive when I relieve myself. If that’s not a completely useless superpower, I don’t know what is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brazil's bats are harboring a vast and diverse pool of coronaviruses, a new study finds, including a newly identified strain that may pose a danger to human health in the years to come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists are taking the threat seriously and will soon conduct testing in a secure lab to see if the variant really could spill over to our own species.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The discovery is cause for concern because the strain is eerily reminiscent of the bat-borne virus behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) – a contagion that causes a very high case fatality rate of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8930171/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;nearly 35 percent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its identification in 2012, the MERS  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="155291" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; (MERS-CoV) has &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers"&gt;caused 858 known deaths&lt;/a&gt;, mostly in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. While mild cases are likely underreported, this  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="155291" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; holds the&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_839_21"&gt; highest case fatality rate&lt;/a&gt; of all the known coronaviruses that can infect humans, making it the most lethal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For comparison, the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS‑CoV‑2, has a human case fatality rate of around 2 percent, according to a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_839_21"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155419" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155419" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-642x856.jpg" alt="Close Relative of Most Lethal Coronavirus Found in Brazil's Bats" class="wp-image-155419 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-642x856.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-311x415.jpg 311w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-600x800.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155419" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The great fruit-eating bat (&lt;em&gt;Artibeus lituratus&lt;/em&gt;) can harbor the new MERS-like virus. (&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Great_fruit-eating_bat_held.jpg"&gt;Juan Cruzado Cortés/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY-SA 4.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists in Brazil and China discovered the close relative of MERS-CoV while testing 16 different bat species in Brazil for pathogens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Taking more than 400 oral and rectal swabs from bats, the international team, led by Bruna Stefanie Silvério from the Federal University of São Paulo, identified seven distinct coronaviruses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;These were harbored by just two species: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvety_free-tailed_bat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molossus molossus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (an insect-eater) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_fruit-eating_bat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artibeus lituratus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (a fruit bat).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only one of the viral variants shares an evolutionary history with MERS-CoV.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Until now, members of the MERS-CoV family had only been documented in bats of &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/10/13-0946_article"&gt;Africa, Europe, and the Middle East&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This indicates that "closely related viruses are circulating in South American bats and expanding their known geographic range," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.70173"&gt;according to the authors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Silvério et al., &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.70173"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists have known that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;viruses found in bats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; are a threat to human safety since long before the 2020 pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, became the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-70962-6_13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;first pandemic transmissible disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the 21st century to have an unknown origin. The fatality ratio of this viral outbreak reached &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1843.2003.00518.x"&gt;around 10 percent&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the epidemic in June 2003.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Later, researchers figured out that bats were a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/research/health-medical/diseases/infectious-diseases/bats-confirmed-host-of-sars-virus"&gt;&lt;span&gt;natural reservoir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for SARS-like coronaviruses, and after years of hard work, they confirmed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1118391"&gt;SARS-CoV-1 spilled over&lt;/a&gt; from these wild mammals to ourselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2012, yet &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/man-tests-positive-for-mers-cov-in-abu-dhabi-who-reports"&gt;&lt;span&gt;another deadly coronavirus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; appeared on the scene. The MERS coronavirus was first identified in Saudi Arabia after most likely jumping from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000342"&gt;bats to camels&lt;/a&gt; to humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While this virus spreads less easily among our own species, travelers have carried the infection to the United States, Europe, Africa, and Asia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of a MERS-like strain in South America underscores the "&lt;span&gt;critical role bats play as reservoirs for emerging viruses," &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.70173"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; Silvério and her team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Right now we aren't sure it can infect humans, but we detected parts of the virus's spike protein [which binds to mammalian cells to start an infection] suggesting potential interaction with the receptor used by MERS-CoV," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076849"&gt;&lt;span&gt;explains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Silvério. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"To find out more, we plan to conduct experiments in Hong Kong during the current year."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since 2020, the world has taken the threat of coronaviruses spilling over from wild mammals to humans &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-covid-like-virus-in-russian-bats-shows-resistance-to-vaccine-antibodies"&gt;&lt;span&gt;more seriously&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; than ever before. The discovery of a threatening bat-borne virus in South America is certainly concerning, but it's also a point of comfort. Now that we know it exists, scientists can keep a close eye on the threat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Bats are important viral reservoirs and should therefore be submitted to continuous epidemiological surveillance," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076849"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; co-author Ricardo Durães-Carvalho, biologist at the Federal University of São Paulo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Better the devil you know than the one you don't.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.70173"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

										&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Tuolumne County, CA—Tuolumne County Public Health (TCPH) is warning the public that it is investigating two suspected cases of measles involving Summerville High School and Adventist Health Sonora (AHS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department cautions the public about potential exposure for anyone at the campus between Monday, March 10, and Tuesday, March 11, 2025, and at the hospital’s emergency room between the late evening of Saturday, March 15, and the early morning of Sunday, March 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an emerging situation; details are pending, and we will update the public as soon as further information is available,” stated health officials, adding, “As part of the investigation, Summerville High School is coordinating closely with public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Summerville Union High School District takes the health and safety of its students, staff, and our community seriously, and we will be working closely with Tuolumne County Public Health through the process of identifying any risk to our students, staff and community,” states Michael Merrill, superintendent of Summerville High School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/local/3645030/safeguarding-against-measles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;As we reported here last week, California had five confirmed measles cases,&lt;/a&gt; and county health put out an alert to the public advising on the best way to protect against the highly infectious disease. In today’s press release they advise that exposed individuals should monitor for symptoms and confirm if their measles vaccination is up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unimmunized persons or those with unknown immunization status who were at these locations during the aforementioned dates and times are at risk of developing measles from 7 to 21 days after being exposed and should monitor for symptoms,” shared health officials, adding, “Exposed individuals who have been free of symptoms for more than 21 days after exposure are no longer at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCPH provided this list of what exposed individuals should do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Review their immunization and medical records to determine if they are protected against measles. People who have not had a measles infection or received the measles immunization previously may not be protected from the measles virus and should talk with a healthcare provider about receiving the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) or Proquad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Monitor themselves for illness with fever and/or an unexplained rash from 7 days to 21 days after their exposure (the time period when symptoms may develop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• If symptoms develop, they should isolate at home and avoid contact with others. Talk to their healthcare provider. Call ahead of their visit to a healthcare facility and make them aware of their measles exposure and symptoms. Public health can assist healthcare providers in appropriately diagnosing and managing your care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An infected person can spread measles up to four days before a rash appears and up to four days after the rash appears. Measles is an airborne illness that can infect others when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs, or sneezes. Health officials stress that the virus can stay in the air and on surfaces for many hours, even after the infected person has left. If others breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth, they can become infected. Young children and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are at a higher risk for life-threatening complications from infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCPH provided these common symptoms of measles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• High fever (higher than 101°F)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Cough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Runny nose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Red and watery eyes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness. The “measles rash” typically starts at the face and then spreads down to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most health insurance covers the cost of vaccines, according to TCPH, noting that being vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella with the MMR or MMRV vaccines is the strongest defense against this disease. The MMRV also guards against varicella or chickenpox. If taken in two doses, they are 97 percent effective. That drops to 93 percent if just one dose is taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If 95% of the population has received both doses of the vaccine, the transmission of measles within the community can be stopped,” stress TCPH officials.&lt;/p&gt;

Health departments in King and Snohomish counties have assessed potential public exposures and determined there is no risk to the general public, according to Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. James Lewis, Health Officer for the Snohomish County Health Department, emphasized the importance of vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/snohomish-county-health-department-confirmed-measles-case-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-exposure-symptoms-king-county-public-health-schd" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/snohomish-county-health-department-confirmed-measles-case-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-exposure-symptoms-king-county-public-health-schd" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;2 cases of measles exposure confirmed in Snohomish County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Measles spreads easily in communities with low immunity, which is why maintaining high vaccination rates is so critical," Lewis said. "We have confirmed a second measles case; without the rapid response from public health departments to conduct contact tracing to identify susceptible individuals, we could have seen significantly more cases.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eric Chow, Communicable Disease Chief for Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County, highlighted the seriousness of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Measles is more than just a rash and can be a very serious infection that affects different parts of the body. It’s hard to watch a loved one experience an illness due to measles," Chow said. "Unfortunately, measles is very contagious and people who are not fully vaccinated are at risk.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to severe complications, including ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and, in rare cases, encephalitis or death. The disease is preventable with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is about 97% effective with two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about measles and vaccination, visit &lt;a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/measles" target="_blank" title="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/measles" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;www.kingcounty.gov/measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 00:01:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxONXFlekZOU0RiT081ZDlMQnRXYUpmMVc1cVE2S2p4WlpXamlqRmZGcVNvMTUzSUxyaU92VEhvTmdhMk1JUzN0bVVVM0lRQkdFUWlzanlaMkc0VTMyMXd4QzR2RzJORVNsWHdrNVZ4UHFES2dzQW5JU21pWmRNM3RZOHYtNEh5OVFnY0xYODVIcUNzV3BoT0xsUVltNlVVeUxMY09zNHgxb3NfaDJHb3owQS1jSXd2ZEJmaFVNaDlISFAxTjFBR0I5TWR3bTlEVnJKdTlzTFUyRFQ4cVdFSUFJZ1Fn</guid></item><item><title>Only 10% of non-surgical treatments for back problems kill pain, says review - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxPMFVPd25HQzk2dWlvV1ctc0R0YmxRSmFvMlhPa2FBbjdyR3lCeE1rdHF5b0hXQmJ4RjJHSFlaQ2Z6R192U1JUM3QxRDM3QThMcU5KT1FtdEJ0WnJsd05pWHlCT0s0VlNUZWxPbE4tWXBLbWpGYUNhU1N6R1NlLUE1S0d2dTd6RDRzM1V4Q0RDT2hVNmlfdjM1TW1TNHFuXzNTQi1sMFVkSFp6S2NKVFpiTVlpR2JNMFl4enZXQjhZSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector  dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Most treatments for back pain do not work and even the few that do bring little relief, a global review of the evidence on one of the world’s commonest health problems has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Six in 10 adults in the UK live with lower back pain at some point.

The other 50 treatments either do not work, only modestly reduce pain or may even worsen it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;That is the conclusion of the most comprehensive review yet of the worldwide evidence surrounding what non-surgical treatments have analgesic – pain-killing – effects on back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Australian researchers led by Dr Aidan Cashin at the pain impact centre at Neuroscience Research Australia examined 301 previously published randomised controlled trials that investigated the 56 treatments or combinations of treatments, such as anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants. The trials were carried out in 44 countries worldwide, including in Europe, North America and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The current evidence shows that one in 10 non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low-back pain are efficacious, providing only small analgesic effects beyond placebo,” conclude the authors, whose findings are published in the medical journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The efficacy for the majority of treatments is uncertain. Our review did not find reliable evidence of large effects for any of the included treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The one treatment that does help those with acute low-back pain is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), they found. In addition, five treatments also bring some relief for chronic low-back pain: exercise, spinal manipulative therapy, &lt;a href="https://www.neuromusculartaping.com/clarifying-the-differences-between-various-taping-techniques-in-rehabilitation-nmt/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;taping&lt;/a&gt;, antidepressants and what are known as transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TPRV1) drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But three treatments for acute back pain do not work – exercise, glucocortisoid injections and taking paracetamol. And two for chronic back pain are also ineffective – antibiotics and anaesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, the evidence for the other 45 treatments is “inconclusive”. The researchers assessed and offered a judgement on the extent to which they all relieved pain. Despite some of them being very popular, most “may provide modest reductions in pain”, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Interventions that “probably provide little to no difference in pain” include exercise, paracetamol, glucocortisoid injections, anaesthetics and antibiotics or antimicrobial drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, having a massage, taking painkillers and wearing foot orthotics “may provide” large reductions in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Heat, acupuncture, spinal manipulation and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/transcutaneous-electrical-nerve-stimulation-tens/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;TENS&lt;/a&gt;) may produce a “moderate” reduction in pain. Osteopathic treatment and using muscle relaxants and NSAIDs together may produce a small lessening of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, two treatments may increase someone’s pain, including extracorporeal shockwaves and the anti-inflammatory drug &lt;a href="https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drugs/colchicine/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;colchicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said that family doctors often refer patients with back pain for physiotherapy as a first-line treatment, to be assessed and given exercises to perform, or to link workers, who suggest non-medical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Many patients do report feeling some relief from the interventions – medical or not – that we suggest,” Hawthorne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Tim Button, the president of the British Chiropractic Association, welcomed the study’s endorsement of spinal manipulation and taping as effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Our members are increasingly seeing patients come to them with back pain, worried that they can’t work and stuck on NHS waiting lists,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“While this may not always be a &lt;em&gt;‘&lt;/em&gt;miracle cure&lt;em&gt;’&lt;/em&gt; to chronic musculoskeletal conditions, it is as effective as other non-invasive treatments and makes a real difference to how quickly people can get back to work and normal life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A Chartered Society of Physiotherapy spokesperson said: “Physiotherapists carry out an in-depth assessment to identify the root causes of back pain, which will be different for everyone and can range widely from stress, fear of movement and poor sleep to smoking, obesity, job-related strain, and insufficient physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Exercise has been shown to be the most helpful treatment for back pain. Hands-on treatments have been shown to have a small benefit to back pain, but only when used as part of a whole treatment programme, which includes exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Similarly, injections may be beneficial as part of a treatment programme, but not on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxPMFVPd25HQzk2dWlvV1ctc0R0YmxRSmFvMlhPa2FBbjdyR3lCeE1rdHF5b0hXQmJ4RjJHSFlaQ2Z6R192U1JUM3QxRDM3QThMcU5KT1FtdEJ0WnJsd05pWHlCT0s0VlNUZWxPbE4tWXBLbWpGYUNhU1N6R1NlLUE1S0d2dTd6RDRzM1V4Q0RDT2hVNmlfdjM1TW1TNHFuXzNTQi1sMFVkSFp6S2NKVFpiTVlpR2JNMFl4enZXQjhZSQ</guid></item><item><title>Pet food sold in WA recalled after link to bird flu -

						Ohio health officials provided an update on the nationwide measles outbreak Tuesday.Bruce Vanderhoff, director of the Ohio Department of Health, hosted the press conference, along with Dr. Matthew Washam, an infections disease doctor at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus.Officials discussed the outbreak while stressing the importance of parents keeping up to date with their children's vaccinations on the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. Vanderhoff said the MMR vaccine is highly effective and safe."The recommended two dose regimen for children has been proven to be 97% effective at protecting against measles, and we also know it is very safe," Vanderhoff said. "There have been some spurious claims in the past that the vaccine is connected to autism, but those claims have been debunked and there is no evidence of a connection."The percentage of students who were up to date on the MMR fell from 89.2 percent in the 2023-24 school year to 88.3 percent in the most recent school year.Measles outbreaks are growing in West Texas and New Mexico. Testing sites and vaccine clinics have opened in outbreak areas and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas last week to support the response. Still, local health officials say spread could continue for months."You can get measles literally by just being in a room where a person with measles has been recently," Vanderhoff said. "This can happen even up to two hours after the person has left."Late last month, Kentucky health officials confirmed an adult had tested positive for the virus, in FrankfortAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 301 cases have been confirmed as of Thursday, March 13, in 15 states. This year, there have been no reported cases in Indiana or Ohio.

&lt;p&gt;Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city of Lubbock, said the outbreak is still growing, with capacity to transmit both locally and further afield through spread to pockets of unvaccinated individuals. Though the response teams have been stressing the importance of vaccination, uptake of vaccines “has definitely been a struggle,” Wells said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is going to be a large outbreak. And we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases, both because we’re still seeing spread and also because we have increased testing capacity, so more people are getting tested,” Wells said during a press conference organized by the Big Cities Health Coalition, a forum for leaders of metropolitan health departments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m really thinking this is going to be a year long in order to get through this entire outbreak,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If the outbreak lasts for longer than 12 months, the United States would lose its status as a country that has achieved &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#:~:text=Historic%20achievement,control%20in%20the%20Americas%20region." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;measles elimination&lt;/a&gt;. Measles-free status means that all cases are either contracted abroad, or linked to spread from someone who has been infected elsewhere. If that ensuing transmission continues for more than a year, however, the virus would be deemed to be endemic again in the country. The U.S. achieved measles elimination status in 2000, but came close to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/04/measles-outbreaks-put-u-s-at-risk-of-losing-prized-elimination-status/"&gt;losing that status in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when a long-running outbreak in New York City and surrounding counties continued for close to a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, Texas has confirmed 279 cases, though that number is undoubtedly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/12/measles-outbreak-larger-than-reported-public-health-experts-say/"&gt;an underestimate&lt;/a&gt;. There are now cases reported in 11 counties in Texas, with the epicenter of the outbreak in rural west Texas, in a community of Mennonites who do not vaccinate their children. &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Only two&lt;/a&gt; of the confirmed cases in Texas have had the recommended two doses of measles-targeting vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To date Texas has recorded one death in this outbreak, in an unvaccinated school-aged child. New Mexico &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has recorded 38 cases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/06/new-mexico-adult-with-measles-dies/"&gt;one death&lt;/a&gt;, in an unvaccinated adult. Oklahoma has reported &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/osdh-reports-additional-measles-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;four confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt;, all in unvaccinated individuals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That evidence of spread underscores the challenges public health faces in bringing the outbreak under control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I just think that it being so rural, now multi-state, it’s just going to take a lot more boots on the ground, a lot more work, to get things under control. It’s not an isolated population,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though efforts to increase vaccination rates among the most affected communities are not meeting with substantial success, Wells said in Lubbock about 300 more doses than normally would be administered have been given in the past couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mixed messaging about the best way to combat measles could be contributing to the difficulties in bringing the outbreak to a close, suggested Phil Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Neither Huang nor the other public health officials at the press conference referenced Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. directly in their remarks. And at a point, Huang sidestepped a question about whether Kennedy — a long-time critic of vaccines, particularly the measles, mumps and rubella shot — was undermining the effort to persuade parents of unvaccinated children to get them vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In interviews and&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/rfk-jr-vaccine-skepticism-on-view-in-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt; a commentary published on the Fox News site&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy has stressed treatment of measles over prevention of the disease, urging the use of vitamin A and cod liver oil. While vitamin A has been shown to improve survival of malnourished children in developing countries when they contract measles, it is in no way a preventive measure. Although it is common practice in measles outbreaks for public health leaders to stress the importance of vaccination, Kennedy has said the decision of whether to vaccinate is down to parental choice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One of the things that we really depend on … is a consistent message, really, from all levels,” Huang said. “All of us, from the highest level down to the ground level need to be reinforcing that message about the importance of vaccines and that vaccines are the way we prevent this and are going to address this, and need to address this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And we do have some concerns when some other messages might dilute that message.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simbo Ige, Chicago’s commissioner of public health, spoke of the struggles her department faced last year during a &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_protection_and_response/news/2024/may/cdph-press-release-05-30-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;large measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; that began in a migrant shelter in the city. Over the course of the outbreak, 30,000 doses of vaccine were administered, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Pussycat Dolls alum Jessica Sutta was left with debilitating medical issues after getting a vaccine for COVID-19. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;iamjessicasutta/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pussycat Dolls alum Jessica Sutta sustained a debilitating injury after getting the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The singer, 42, said she began experiencing horrific symptoms just days after receiving her second dose of the Moderna vaccine in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I woke up with a muscle spasm in my right rib that just would not get out,” she recalled during&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14491779/pussycat-dolls-covid-vaccine-injuries-jessica-sutta.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; an interview with Daily Mail published Tuesday.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It felt like a knife inside was burning. It wrapped around my rib cage and up and down my spine, and it felt like I was on the brink of death.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The singer discussed her painful symptoms from the Moderna vaccine in an interview with Daily Mail.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;iamjessicasutta/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sutta said she started experiencing spasms and muscle pain just days after getting her second dose of the vaccine in 2021.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sutta, who started experiencing spasms and tremors in her legs, said that she feels like her body has been “completely hijacked.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pop star shared that she was left bed-bound and unable to dance for more than a few minutes at a time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Any physical activity I pay for the next day, and my body just flares, and it’s very disappointing because I love to dance. It’s who I am,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The “Don’t Cha” artist (seen here in 2011) felt like she was “on the brink of death.”  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;WireImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sutta (seen here in 2024) also lost a ton of weight. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;iamjessicasutta/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sutta struggled with chronic fatigue, muscle pain and extreme weight loss, dropping a staggering 50 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It felt like my body was eating itself,” she said. “And you can imagine living in Hollywood, you lose a lot of weight after you have a baby, and it’s, like, the best thing to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her symptoms took a toll on her personal life and she had trouble caring for her 3-year-old son M.J.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s times where I can’t lift him. I can’t put him in the car, I need someone to help me,” she said of her son, who was just a newborn when she started feeling symptoms. “There’s days that I can’t get out of bed, and I’m on the heating pad, and there’s so much mom guilt that just overflows from my entire being.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seeking answers, Sutta attended a roundtable discussion where other people expressed having similar symptoms. She also connected with anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., during his 2024 presidential campaign and spoke out about her symptoms on her own platform. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sutta (seen here with her Pussycat Dolls bandmates in 2006) had trouble taking care of her young son due to her pain.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The “Buttons” singer (seen here in 2019) ended up being diagnosed with vaccine-induced lupus seven months ago.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m willing to risk my reputation so this doesn’t happen to anyone else,” Sutta said. “There are many people in the industry way, bigger than me with a bigger outreach, with vaccine injuries. But they won’t speak out. And for me, I just couldn’t hold my tongue.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sutta emphasized that she does believe in the technology but will no longer “blindly trust” the medical system after what she has gone through. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m not ‘anti’ anything. I’m just anti being sick,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While doctors initially thought Sutta had multiple sclerosis and dismissed concerns that her pain was caused by the vaccine, she finally got some answers seven months ago when she was diagnosed with vaccine-induced lupus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sutta (seen here in 2002) shut down the claim that she is an anti-vaxxer.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“I’m not ‘anti’ anything. I’m just anti being sick,” Sutta (seen here in 2023) said.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The autoimmune condition is caused by the body’s response to a vaccine going rogue and producing cells that attack healthy tissue. The subsequent inflammation explained Sutta’s skin rashes, joint pain, muscle soreness and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis helped Sutta’s doctors figure out a more effective treatment and she now uses steroids to control her flareups. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I still get the muscle spasms here and there,'” Sutta said. “Things have gotten a little bit better through therapies and steroids, but I don’t want to live my life like that. I just want my body back. I want to be able to dance again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “Don’t Cha” artist also takes a lupus medication called hydroxychloroquine and she monitors her diet by avoiding gluten and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The pop star (seen here in 2024 with anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in 2024) decided to speak up so she could help others struggling.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;iamjessicasutta/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;She now manages her symptoms with steroids, medications and a strict diet.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;iamjessicasutta/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But even after all of this, even though I’m having a better day today, I don’t feel like myself anymore,” she said. “My heart just breaks for everyone who has suffered long COVID because they understand. You’re just not yourself anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suttan, who believes she was going to die within the first six months of her health struggles, said she is more optimistic these days that she will “persevere through this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am going to conquer this. And that’s my message to other vaccine-injured [people] going through what I’m going through: don’t give up,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak impacting Texas and New Mexico has now exceeded 300 cases, surpassing the number of measles cases reported in all of the U.S. last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the latest update from the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), 279 measles cases have been reported in the state. In neighboring New Mexico, 38 cases have been confirmed as of Tuesday, totaling 317 cases across both states.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In all of 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 285 cases nationally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cases have primarily occurred in Gaines County, Texas, and Lea County, N.M., which sit opposite each other on the Texas-New Mexico border.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been two deaths, one in each state, related to the current measles outbreak, and both occurred in patients who were unvaccinated. The death in Texas was directly attributed to measles, while the cause of death for the New Mexican individual, who tested positive for the virus, is still being investigated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the cases in Texas, 36 have resulted in hospitalizations, while two people have been hospitalized in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious respiratory viral illnesses, with one infected individual capable of infecting nine out of 10 unvaccinated people they encounter. There are no antivirals or treatments specifically indicated for measles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, there have been three confirmed outbreaks of measles in the U.S. so far in 2025, with 93 percent of cases linked to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Two full doses of a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is 97 percent effective against measles and only needs to be done once in a lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As DSHS emphasized in its update, it takes 14 days after vaccination for the body to develop an immunity to measles, and it is only at that point at which someone is considered fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is the first to shed light on the molecular differences between directly acquired PTSD and bystander PTSD and could pave the way for changes in how the disorders are treated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currently, patients with directly acquired PTSD and bystander PTSD are treated the same way – with a combination of therapy and medication,”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Timothy Jarome,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the project’s principal investigator and associate professor of neurobiology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research suggests that indirect trauma and direct trauma create different biological responses, which could mean they require different treatment strategies that target distinct brain pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Understanding how observation leads to PTSD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jarome’s research focuses on understanding the neurobiological mechanisms behind memory-related disorders, including PTSD, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease. His interest in bystander PTSD arose after learning about PTSD symptoms reported in people who witnessed the deadly 2021 collapse of a Miami condominium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who saw it from across the street reported that they were suffering from nightmares, insomnia, and anxiety,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were showing symptoms of PTSD, but didn’t go through it or have any connection to the people in the building. We sought out to understand the brain mechanisms behind how that occurred.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers focused on protein changes caused by a fear stimulus in three key brain regions involved in fear memory: the amygdala, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the retrosplenial cortex. They discovered that witnessing trauma triggered distinct protein degradation patterns in all three regions, compared to directly experiencing trauma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they uncovered sex-specific differences in how male and female brains process indirect fear memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings build on previous research from Jarome’s lab, which identified a specific protein, known as K-63 ubiquitin, linked to PTSD development in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight significant biological differences in how male and female brains respond to witnessing trauma,” said the paper’s lead author, Shaghayegh Navabpour, a former Ph.D. student in translational biology, medicine, and health who is now a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These differences may help explain why women are twice as likely as men to develop PTSD, leading to more targeted treatments that consider these sex-specific factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future research, Jarome hopes to explore how these how these molecular pathways could be leveraged to develop more precise PTSD therapies. He also hopes to examine the role of empathy, which originates in a different brain region called the anterior insular cortex, in bystander PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The vital role of student researchers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by a $420,000 grant from the National Institute of Mental Health, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. In addition to supporting equipment and materials costs of the research, the grant helped pay the stipends of graduate and undergraduate research assistants on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At academic institutions, students — undergraduate, graduate, and postdocs — are the driving force for research,” Jarome said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While faculty members might secure the funding to do the projects, the reality is that the work is done by these students as they’re going through their training. Without graduate students, especially, but also undergraduates and postdocs, science doesn’t advance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navabpour, who earned her Ph.D. from Virginia Tech in 2023, is now working at Stanford to develop a drug to help treat Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My time in Dr. Jarome’s lab was hugely valuable in shaping my career and preparing me for my current role as a postdoc and my goal of becoming a faculty member,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I learned how to think scientifically — how to ask the right questions and approach problems critically — and gained hands-on experience with key methods and techniques that continue to inform my research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and PTSD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d4b9bfb5a7bcb6a1a6ba94a2a0fab1b0a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Margaret Ashburn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Margaret Ashburn – Virginia Tech&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research:&lt;/strong&gt; Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315564" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Indirectly acquired fear memories have distinct, sex-specific molecular signatures from directly acquired fear memories&lt;/a&gt;” by Timothy Jarome et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indirectly acquired fear memories have distinct, sex-specific molecular signatures from directly acquired fear memories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that affects women more than men. About 30% of patients suffering from PTSD develop the disorder by witnessing a traumatic event happen to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as the focus has remained on those directly experiencing the traumatic event, whether indirectly acquired fear memories that underlie PTSD have the same molecular signature as those that are directly acquired remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, using a rodent indirect fear learning paradigm where one rat (observer) watches another rat (demonstrator) associate an auditory cue with foot shock, we found that fear can be indirectly acquired by both males and females regardless of the sex or novelty (familiarity) of the demonstrator animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, behaviorally, indirectly acquired fear responses resemble those of pseudoconditioning, a behavioral response that is thought to not represent learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, using unbiased proteomics, we found that indirectly acquired fear memories have distinct protein degradation profiles in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) relative to directly acquired fear memories and pseudoconditioning, which further differed significantly by sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;em&gt;Egr2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;c-fos&lt;/em&gt; expression in the retrosplenial cortex of observer animals resembled that of demonstrator rats but was significantly different than that of pseudoconditioned rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings reveal that indirectly acquired fear memories have sex-specific molecular signatures that differ from those of directly acquired fear memories or pseudoconditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data have important implications for understanding the neurobiology of indirectly acquired fear memories that may underlie bystander PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 19:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5hZ2ZxdnRLNklvS1lOM3V5TFJaNngyYURhUGl0aVBYSGZ2Y1VGUlFwWkl3Q01kNndSN0g0R3ZLZ2pUZTRmRW1ydWpSc1VrVWhVdzRSaWNkSzE0anROQmhmcUQ5TVl6SHdER3J6NHNRTy0</guid></item><item><title>Verbal Fluency Might Predict Human Longevity - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE9BdXNlWVJXTjdsb0hzdmJCRmRvT1RoT2ZjYVd0V3g2UUVTLTFVc056bExnaFg4cndyMlQ5ZTVrd0pGTGdDZDRNMEMyWHlEd1J1UG1SNUd6bURtMDZaTkw3MzJidWJXQTRhTnBGbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A recent study reveals a surprising link between longevity and verbal fluency—the ability to effectively recall and utilize vocabulary. Researchers analyzed cognitive data from the Berlin Aging Study, involving over 500 elderly participants tracked for nearly two decades, assessing verbal fluency alongside memory, perceptual speed, and verbal knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of these cognitive traits, verbal fluency emerged as the strongest predictor of longevity, indicating that individuals with sharper linguistic abilities tend to live longer. This finding suggests verbal fluency might serve as a marker of broader cognitive and physical well-being, highlighting the intricate connection between mental acuity and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verbal Fluency &amp;amp; Longevity:&lt;/strong&gt; Among various cognitive traits tested, verbal fluency alone showed a significant link to increased lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensive Dataset:&lt;/strong&gt; The study analyzed data collected over 18 years from 516 elderly participants in the Berlin Aging Study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex Cognitive Marker:&lt;/strong&gt; Verbal fluency likely serves as an indicator of broader health and cognitive function, including memory and mental agility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;APS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone ages, but, sometimes, people outlive all predictions. Previous research has uncovered an unlikely factor related to longevity: intelligence (Bäckman &amp;amp; MacDonald, 2006; Bosworth &amp;amp; Siegler, 2002).  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, intelligence isn’t a simple characteristic. There are many traits that contribute to it that can be tested—from memory to mathematical logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108165"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man and words." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Following that theory, verbal fluency would be a good measure of well-being, Ghisletta explained, because it’s a complex process that relies on multiple cognitive abilities. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2024 &lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychological Science &lt;/em&gt;study, Paolo Ghisletta of the University of Geneva linked longevity specifically to one of those traits: verbal fluency, the measure of one’s vocabulary and ability to use it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghisletta’s research used samples from the Berlin Aging Study, which started collecting data shortly before the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 (Baltes &amp;amp; Mayer, 1999). It tracked 516 people aged 70 to 105 from enrollment to their death, over as long as 18 years in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured factors like dental health, stress levels, and economic well-being, as well as cognition. This makes it a “rich and rare data set,” said Ghisletta in an interview.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current study, researchers sampled nine different cognitive tests to understand if different aspects of intelligence might be more closely linked to longevity than others.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests measured four cognitive abilities: verbal fluency, perceptual speed, verbal knowledge, and episodic memory. Perceptual speed is a measure of one’s ability to compare, scan, or perform pattern-assessing tasks with visual cues quickly. Verbal knowledge is a measure of one’s vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Episodic memory is a measure of one’s ability to recall and remember personal experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these categories was measured with several tests. One of the tests, for instance, measured verbal fluency by requiring participants to name as many animals as they could within 90 seconds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compiling data on the different cognitive skills, Ghisletta and his team incorporated information about how the participants’ performance changed and estimated their risk of dying over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then developed a model that related the observed changes to risk of death. This required input from researchers across multiple universities with expertise in a type of data analysis called joint multivariate longitudinal survival model.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today, it’s gotten much easier to do this kind of research because there are more data available. There are more people who are willing to collaborate. There are better tools,” Ghisletta said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying these novel tools, the researchers discovered that verbal fluency alone seemed to be significantly linked to longevity, though the explanation behind this connection is not clear.  One popular theory, Ghisletta explained, is that the physical body is inextricably linked to mental, emotional, and cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of these domains are just declining together, whether it’s cognition, personality, emotions, or biological, medical decline in general,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following that theory, verbal fluency would be a good measure of well-being, Ghisletta explained, because it’s a complex process that relies on multiple cognitive abilities. This might include long-term memory, vocabulary, efficiency, and visual memory. So, when you’re testing your verbal fluency, “you are doing something very interesting,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research answers questions that Ghisletta has had since his time as a postdoctoral researcher in the 1990s. But it only became possible to perform analyses of this sort recently. He said this paper underscores the importance of collaboration between labs and makes him hopeful for more fruitful papers to come.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a good time to be doing research. I’m really happy to work with young PhD students and have them play around with these different data sets and variables and the theoretical questions that we want to answer,” Ghisletta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we are building up knowledge, every day, there’s still so much here to discover.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this language and longevity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84ece6f6ebf3eac4f4f7fde7ecebe8ebe3ede7e5e8f7e7ede1eae7e1aaebf6e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hannah Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://psychologicalscience.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;APS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hannah Brown – APS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orignial Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09567976241311923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Verbal Fluency Selectively Predicts Survival in Old and Very Old Age&lt;/a&gt;” by Paolo Ghisletta et al. &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verbal Fluency Selectively Predicts Survival in Old and Very Old Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intelligence is known to predict survival, but it remains unclear whether cognitive abilities differ in their relationship to survival in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed longitudinal data of 516 healthy adults (age: &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; = 84.92 years, &lt;em&gt;SD&lt;/em&gt; = 8.66 years at Wave 1) from the Berlin Aging Study (Germany) on nine tasks of perceptual speed, episodic memory, verbal fluency, and verbal knowledge, and a general composite intelligence score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were eight waves, with up to 18 years of follow-up; all participants were deceased by the time of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a joint multivariate longitudinal survival model to estimate the unique contribution of each cognitive ability in terms of true (i.e., error-free) current value and current rate of change when predicting survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional survival covariates included age at first occasion, sex, sociobiographical status, and suspected dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the two verbal-fluency measures were uniquely predictive of mortality risk.

She has denied going under the knife&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Generally, there are two types of ear lobes: free and attached. While attached ear lobes are directly connected to the head, free ones are floppy and hang down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But if your colleague's ear lobes are overly stretched out, it may not be not genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Pixie ear' (sometimes known as 'bat ear'), says Dr Norman Rowe, a plastic surgeon at Rowe Plastic Surgery in New Jersey, is a 'telltale' sign that someone has been under the knife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told the Daily Mail: 'Pixie ear is certainly not normal and not anatomic, and it's usually a result of as face lift, neck lift, or both.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ear lobe normally has a 'U' shape that stops before hitting the cheek. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But if someone has had a face or neck lift, and surgeons put too much pressure on the incision site, it can cause the ear lobe to become abnormally stretched.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A face lift, also called a rhytidectomy, involves pulling back a flap of skin on each side of the face to reduce sagging and produce a tightened effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are several types of face lift, but a traditional one involves separating skin from its underlying tissues and tightening the muscles around the face and neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 131,000 Americans get a face lift every year. They can cost anywhere between $11,000 to $30,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A neck lift, also called a lower rhytidectomy, is less invasive and is performed about 160,000 times per year. They generally costs between $3,000 and $15,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plastic surgeons have suggested that Demi Moore has 'pixie ears.' She has denied having plastic surgery in the past&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sean McNally, a plastic surgeon at the Oregon Clinic in Portland, told the Daily Mail that scarring near the back of the ear could also indicate a recent face lift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'For face lifts the incisions are typically run around the ear. The ones in front of the ear can heal so well it’s hard to tell, but the ones behind the ear are usually more visible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rowe noted that someone who has had a face lift may have a 'boxier' tragus, the small, pointed cartilage flap located in front of the ear canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It's normally got a curve to it, but when you cut behind the ear, sometimes it ends up being a little boxy. That is telltale.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Hair changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plastic surgeon Dr Johnny Betteridge has suggested that Kim Kardashian may have had a face lift based on changes to her hairline. He said: 'Given her facial appearance, I think she had a Ponytail Facelift around two or three years ago, where the scars are discreetly put in the hairline by the temple and behind the ear'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tom Brady is pictured during the Super Bowl last month. Generally, there should be about an inch of space between the end of a man's sideburns and the start of his beard. If that space looks like it is closing up, it is usually because of a face lift, since the face gets pulled back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Is your coworker suddenly wearing her hair down for the first time in months? She may have had a face lift, Dr Rowe says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I see it all the time with my patients if they're one, two or three weeks post op. Their hairstyle automatically changes. They might wear their hair one way for years, then all of a sudden their hair is different,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's to cover up scars. Especially if you've had a face lift, you're not going to pin it back.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rowe said the same goes for a man, as he may let his beard grow out to hide swelling and incision sites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Generally, there should be about an inch of space between the end of a man's sideburns and the start of his beard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Christopher Costa, founder of Platinum Plastic Surgery in Las Vegas, said that if that space looks like it is closing up, it is usually because of a face lift, since the face gets pulled back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also noted that if a person's hairline starts to shift, it could be due to a brow lift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also called a forehead lift, a brow lift involves repositioning the forehead to get rid of wrinkles and raise the eyebrows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 88,000 brow lifts are performed in the US every year, and they cost about $5,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman may also stop dying her roots if she's had a brow lift, Dr Rowe says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you color your hair, the toxic chemicals can affect the incisions and the wound healing. You won't want someone manipulating the scalp too aggressively because it can cause the incision to open up,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plastic surgeon Dr Jonny Betteridge has suggested that Kim Kardashian may have had a face lift based on changes to her hairline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Given her facial appearance, I think she had a Ponytail Facelift around two or three years ago, where the scars are discreetly put in the hairline by the temple and behind the ear' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Maybe it's not just Maybelline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Love Island UK star Alexandra Cane, pictured here, confirmed she had CO2 laser resurfacing done in 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Everyone seems to have a skincare routine and nearly three in four US women wear makeup regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But if a co-worker's skin looks too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Costa said: 'Yes, skincare works. But glass-smooth skin with no pores, no fine lines and an almost wax-like glow? That is likely a combination of laser resurfacing, chemical peels and Botox.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In laser skin resurfacing, surgeons use a beam to destroy the outer layer of skin and heat the underlying layer. This is said to stimulate the growth of collagen, a protein that improves firmness and texture, leading the skin to become smoother and tighter as it heals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Per procedure, skin resurfacing costs between $400 and $500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A chemical peel, meanwhile, is another type of 'resurfacing' that uses chemical solutions rather than lasers to remove the top layers of the skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Depending on how deep the procedure goes, peels can remove wrinkles, acne, uneven skin tones, dryness, scars and precancerous growths, according to the Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Light chemical peels cost around $100 to $300, while deeper peels can run up to $6,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;'Narrow' or 'bunny' nose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Anne Hathaway has never confirmed or denied rumors about having a nose job, though plastic surgeon Dr Gary Motykie has told the Daily Mail that he has 'no doubt she had surgery on her nose.' He said: 'You see it go from a slightly more plunging bulbous tip with a wide bridge to having a much more defined contour and thinner bridge... That's the leading sign of having a rhinoplasty'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A radical nose job may be pretty obvious, but sometimes you'll have to look out for more subtle signs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as a rhinoplasty, the operation changes the size and shape of the nose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The surgery may involve making the nose smaller by removing some of the cartilage and bone, or making it larger by adding cartilage from the ears and, sometimes, bone from the hips, elbow or skull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, a rhinoplasty costs around $7,000, though they can range up to $15,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Costa explained that while a good rhinoplasty should be undetectable, a narrow nose is often a sign of a recent procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'A good rhinoplasty is all about balance, but if the nose tip looks pinched or the nostrils suddenly flare in a way they never used to, it's a sign of overcorrection.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs of Botox could also show up on a colleague's nose. Experts point to bunny lines, creases along both sides of the nose that form when someone laughs, smiles or squints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These typically form if too much Botox has been injected into the area, as it can weaken the muscles that hold our eyebrows down into place. Muscles around the nose then have to over-compensate, causing the bunny lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additional Botox at the sides of the nose can help get rid of bunny lines, though they do also naturally fade in about three to four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Costa noted a new 'tiny shadow above the upper lip' could be another indicator of a rhinoplasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That means the angle of the nose has changed, likely from surgery,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cleveland Clinic estimates 350,000 nose jobs are performed every year in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That also makes it a convenient moment to pop our daily vitamin supplements. But it turns out the drink you choose to wash them down with has a lot to do with it how much of the goodness your body actually soaks up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry to break it to you, but &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/best-time-to-drink-coffee" target="_blank"&gt;your morning brew&lt;/a&gt; may not be ideal. While we rely on caffeine for a jolt of energy, it can also interfere with how well some vitamins and minerals are absorbed by the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are six vitamin and mineral supplements that you should avoid taking with tea or coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Iron&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron is essential in making hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that helps carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of your body. It plays a key role in energy production, hormone synthesis, strengthening the immune system, and even neurological development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/iron/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/iron/"}' href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/iron/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the NHS&lt;/a&gt;, women who lose a lot of blood during their monthly period are at higher risk of &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/12-signs-that-you-could-have-an-iron-deficiency-and-how-to-feel-better" target="_blank"&gt;iron deficiency&lt;/a&gt; anemia and may need to supplement. The trouble is, “caffeine can inhibit the absorption of iron supplements—the same goes for the iron in your food,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rhian Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;, nutritional therapist and founder of Artah. “Studies have shown that coffee and tea intake can also inhibit iron from food sources, so if you’re anemic or pregnant and working to get your levels up, it’s useful to pay particular attention to this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2598894/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that polyphenols, especially tannins, can also play havoc with your iron supplement. These plant compounds found in tea and coffee essentially bind with iron during digestion, reducing the amount that your body absorbs. Switching to decaffeinated tea or coffee sadly isn’t the answer, as the polyphenols still remain intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially true of non-heme iron found in plant foods such as nuts, whole grains, and leafy greens, says Rhian. “This is because of their polyphenol content, which can transform non-heme iron into a form that is non-absorbable,” she notes. “There is a lesser effect on heme [animal-based] iron.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100823172327.htm" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100823172327.htm"}' href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100823172327.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Scientists&lt;/a&gt; have found that vitamin D influences over 200 genes in our body. It keeps our &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/best-immune-system-booster-foods-to-eat-right-now" target="_blank"&gt;immune systems&lt;/a&gt; healthy, regulates our sex hormones, and is essential for the body to absorb calcium in order to strengthen bones and teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also key for regulating sleep. “Low vitamin D levels increase the risk of sleep difficulties, including shorter sleep duration, increased nocturnal awakenings, and delayed sleep onset,” Rhian explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some studies have shown that we can experience a caffeine-induced decrease in vitamin D receptor expression, resulting in lower levels in those who drink more caffeine,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://scholarship.miami.edu/esploro/outputs/conferenceProceeding/Caffeine-decreases-vitamin-D-receptor-protein/991031562323102976" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://scholarship.miami.edu/esploro/outputs/conferenceProceeding/Caffeine-decreases-vitamin-D-receptor-protein/991031562323102976"}' href="https://scholarship.miami.edu/esploro/outputs/conferenceProceeding/Caffeine-decreases-vitamin-D-receptor-protein/991031562323102976" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;joint study&lt;/a&gt; by Creighton University in Nebraska and the University of Miami, Florida, found that caffeine reduced the expression of vitamin D receptors on osteoblasts—the cells in our bodies responsible for producing bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin C, B vitamins, magnesium, and potassium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s not much that vitamin C can’t do. It helps the body produce &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/gallery/best-collagen-supplements" target="_blank"&gt;collagen&lt;/a&gt;, a protein used to make cartilage, ligaments, skin, and blood vessels. Vitamin C also helps with wound healing and is a potent antioxidant, which protects your body’s DNA from damaging free radicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Glamour</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:41:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQanM3TDZmZF9lNnU4MTV0MlhVcW52QUNjRTJVbVhrcHBoTGF3TGZXRWZyRlpJR1p2c2hycXJNUFhwUmFKSVJITUFHOUx5cnVrRlRLRkJZTHRCeDROSFJEQTNGTjJxYmR3MGVFZkFuc185YTJLSmlHYmJJanBrMVpERncxOFg3eExsbnpqQmdn</guid></item><item><title>The New Cancer Theory That Could Change Everything We Know - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQMnpkdTlheVBYeklIWHI1a1FzX3NQbXVIZXRtREpEZjVScll3RlVSRElFbkxPRjA1RnhNOXA1cU5hd0dUak1WcDdiU0M2Ylhxc2ZISmNWNFJKaExLd25ibXRWQk1GSE94NEZfdWJUT2NWWFR3Vk5DRmt1SHJOT2JocWR2ZTkwaGF4NV9pSg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:00:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxQMnpkdTlheVBYeklIWHI1a1FzX3NQbXVIZXRtREpEZjVScll3RlVSRElFbkxPRjA1RnhNOXA1cU5hd0dUak1WcDdiU0M2Ylhxc2ZISmNWNFJKaExLd25ibXRWQk1GSE94NEZfdWJUT2NWWFR3Vk5DRmt1SHJOT2JocWR2ZTkwaGF4NV9pSg</guid></item><item><title>Where does your city rank on the list of the U.S. ‘allergy capitals’? - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNakFiakNndGxsZGZEQjJYdGI4c1dJVldaU2dlamFlNVlTMmdhZnhfaVJlclhPV3lmOG1sSHBNd2ktMVpoZk5jSkFpV2ZiMjJyTm9ZMmdDQUVuQ0VucmN2cTlnRXpvRC1sWTc1SVlMVFh6SDgyTy1qVmlPSl9rWWJmVFFOMnZ3ZGp0aC05VHItSTdyZVdU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AEC3WVQRIFCLDN73I4LPFOJD7M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pollen seasons are not the same across the United States. Now, &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/asthma-allergy-research/allergy-capitals/"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; released Tuesday by the nonprofit Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America shows where allergy sufferers had it the worst last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LKPS73HJXFD4DCZDMX5CZ4TRLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;About a quarter of U.S. adults suffer from seasonal allergies — many experiencing itchy and watery eyes, a scratchy throat and an ever-running nose. Pollen exposure is now lasting longer and intensifying nationwide, data shows, as warmer temperatures take over more of the year. But for some areas, the changes are more dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T5X2NNB22FCIBBFQLBHBDCNNEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The report ranks the top 100 largest U.S. cities by how challenging they were for allergy sufferers to live in last year. These “allergy capitals” are based not only on pollen counts, but also on the use of over-the-counter medication and the number of allergy physicians in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RBUZJ2XBSJBTROS43BWFKGQJAI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The top cities belonged to the Midwest and Southeast, which are also regions expected to see a lot more pollen as the climate warms. For the third year in a row, Wichita, Kansas, was the most challenging place to live with allergies. New Orleans ranked the second most challenging — jumping up 30 spots from last year — due to a higher weed pollen season probably fueled by moisture from hurricane season and record fall warmth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YYTYRA2YUFDTPHRNP2J5WBVJU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some of the least problematic places to live with allergies last year were in the Northeast, a result of low pollen, probably from drought, and above-average access to medical help. Boston, which was ranked the least challenging allergy city, experienced relatively low tree, grass and weed pollen and has a high number of allergy physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZKQPFBKJVRC6DD3G3AQPM255DA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Washington, D.C., which had an average amount of pollen, also ranked as a lower “allergy city” because of a high number of allergists in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ERBRBVJHUNASFLNDMEJW4VN55A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pollen was also unusually high in California last year. Many cities, which are typically low in pollen, experienced above-average pollen last year. A likely culprit was the deluge of wet weather there, including atmospheric rivers, that helped grass and weeds grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="66PXGNBNDRC25HFAKCMBD7N3JE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Places with the least amount of pollen concentrated around the Upper Midwest and Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PRILKS6BMBCBVFFCJXQVWTXIHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If your city is ranked lower on the list, the report “doesn’t mean to dismiss how badly people are feeling in certain regions,” said Kenny Mendez, president of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZAJELAYZBNAAJMY5OZZQLPGQSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If that were a bad season for you, and you’re really suffering … then it might be time for you to go see a doctor&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;” Mendez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="VVF74MZJ2FHDZL62KQBNN5BWMM" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="VVF74MZJ2FHDZL62KQBNN5BWMM"&gt;Living in the most challenging places&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BJ74D4R245HEFBBJ7HSUECERZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In his nearly 50-year career, immunologist Maurice Strickland has practiced in several states. But he’s never seen a place as bad as Wichita, which was ranked the most challenging city in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PA5NSN7DOFCJ7HNB3GQSHBQKPU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“People have quite a lot of allergy here in Wichita, more than any other place I lived or practiced,” said Strickland, who has been running a private practice in the city for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QH2AUY6SYJEXNNZRPBJNLNOIUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People usually have issues with allergies at different times of the year, although seasons begin to merge as it becomes warmer overall on Earth. Tree pollen typically creates problems in the spring, grass pollen overwhelms in the summer and ragweed pollen appears in the fall. When any of these pollens enter our bodies, our immune system mistakenly identifies these substances as intruders and produces antibodies to attack them — inducing runny noses, wheezing, watery eyes and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VXN25T56DNET5DRUWSZJGNDY4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last year, cities in the Midwest and Southeast topped the list of most challenging places to live with allergies. Both are in warmer regions and have big pollen-producing vegetation, and they are worsening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4YRW5YEICZFT3ISLSIMQLM3UZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Across the United States,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;pollen seasons begin earlier and last longer&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;than they did decades ago. A &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2013284118"&gt;study found&lt;/a&gt; that pollen season starts 20 days earlier than 30 years ago. Pollen counts also increased by 21 percent over the same period — but the greatest increases are in the Midwest and Texas, and in tree pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6UCJK2S5HFEBTBYJT2TNFGOYKU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Wichita has consistently shown high pollen counts for trees and grasses, according to 11 years’ worth of data from the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. The city has a lot of trees that produce pollen,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;including oak and birch trees. It can also be in the crosswinds for additional pollen from nearby states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KCJRQCOCDNEBNHCQPJ6D4FP5JI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“With the big winds we have and flat Kansas,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;pollens come up from warmer climates like the Hill Country of Texas,” Strickland said. “They can show up even before the growing season here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YUBBGTR22JDP7EQ4CBNK2GDVZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last year, tree pollen season also began early in Austin — beginning in December and peaking in March. Midwest cities such as Austin and Tulsa usually suffer from “cedar fever” in the winter months from its Ashe juniper pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KXGARTUESJGQPPK2VCMM25LVAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The pollen keeps Strickland busy in Wichita. Strickland’s practice is one of only a few offices — enough to count on perhaps one hand — specializing in allergy treatment in the city, which has about 400,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DMVRMP4QYFFZZFDF66QVCITXFQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Doctors who aren’t specialists like Strickland are also seeing more patients with allergies but have limited tests. At the American Family Care Urgent Care, family medicine physician Samrah Mansoor sees a lot more allergy patients during spring. Her 17-year-old son is experiencing allergies for the first time this year and is having trouble sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NQCS4UBXLVASFH7TS2DX37JQIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We are a small town. We’re not a huge town that we have a ton of specialists,” said Mansoor, the medical director of the clinic.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;As a result, patients often go to their primary-care physicians or urgent care. She said doctors often suggest over-the-counter medications for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EW2SHQWOYRHBNEDUSLRRPBW2QQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Outside of the Midwest, many Southeast cities also usually experience worse-than-average pollen. Some reasons include the types of trees in the region and disturbances to the land, said plant physiologist Lewis Ziska, who was not involved in the report. Construction, for example, disturbs the soil and promotes the growth of weed species and pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QC7FPQMDFJCBFKOXSEGSD2SAZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The same scenario plays out for many of the top 20 challenging cities, according to the report. Nearly all had worse-than-average pollen counts last year, and the report shows they had a low number of specialists or high use of over-the-counter medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="FUHUVW6RVVBM3MEKFIVJRBTDBM" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="FUHUVW6RVVBM3MEKFIVJRBTDBM"&gt;Where to go for the least challenging allergies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2IPXWL5UV5HUBL4UNGH4HI3VIU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Allergies are expected to get worse in coming decades. Warmer temperatures allow trees, grasses and weeds to grow for longer periods of time. The increase in carbon dioxide also acts as extra fuel to allow vegetation to grow even bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HJCLVP72VVCTFBGZGNI3Q22OM4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So where should you go if you want to avoid a lot of allergy problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BLNY34VHNZGTPP4AJJQ4UZHLTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The southeast and mountain regions consistently had the &lt;a href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/10/4105/2017/gmd-10-4105-2017.pdf"&gt;highest pollen concentrations&lt;/a&gt; in the past , said atmospheric scientist Yingxiao Zhang. But some of the lowest pollen levels were found in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, California and the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MF1G06BD7H4TFFR10G9NC8VX70" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Compared with the other regions of the United States, cities in the Northeast ranked relatively well with allergies last year, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SIICEGTGZVCKVMC77R7UJO6RM4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One factor for the lower pollen may be its relatively shorter season. In the Northeast, maple, birch, oak and cedar trees are the prominent pollen producers, but they last for a short time — typically from April to the beginning of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="67OCQ7BKCFHYHL25NDCTHMYOJM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the shorter season can be more intense in the Northeast than other places, said Zhang, a researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. As temperatures and carbon dioxide increase, the growth of these allergenic trees begins to overlap more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2BVMLF3P2JEQNMT5TKNYJ7N7DU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Weed pollen season also picks up in the Northeast at the end of the summer into the fall. Last year, though, a regional drought probably stifled plant growth and pollen. The region also has a high number of allergists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SCHUK7QI5JDDJJHSFN22P3HSWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Overall though, scientists say, cities&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;are some of the worst places to live if you have allergies. For one, air pollution — especially small particulate matter — can further stimulate the immune system and create more symptoms when inhaled at the same time as pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OQVNVJVG4VGZZNT3XMOJOESTIE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Secondly, the concrete jungles absorb more sunlight and increase the temperatures of cities by a few degrees, which allow plants to grow bigger, faster and longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PBAOETMK6VBWFA2C225BSIWWHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(03)00959-X/fulltext"&gt;one experiment&lt;/a&gt;, Ziska and his team planted ragweed in urban Baltimore, where temperatures and carbon dioxide was greater, and outside the city. They found the urban ragweed grew quicker, flowered earlier and produced more pollen than the ragweed outside of the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GU6Y3LCL5JBMBFYVJQ2E65NMFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We have cities that are getting warmer … which in turn obviously can affect pollen,” said Ziska, an&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;associate professor at Columbia University. “They’re in some ways sort of a surrogate for future climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNakFiakNndGxsZGZEQjJYdGI4c1dJVldaU2dlamFlNVlTMmdhZnhfaVJlclhPV3lmOG1sSHBNd2ktMVpoZk5jSkFpV2ZiMjJyTm9ZMmdDQUVuQ0VucmN2cTlnRXpvRC1sWTc1SVlMVFh6SDgyTy1qVmlPSl9rWWJmVFFOMnZ3ZGp0aC05VHItSTdyZVdU</guid></item><item><title>An expert trainer says these are the three best exercises for longevity, helping you ‘live better for longer’ - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNT3oyUTlQWnJEdnQ2bEl1OXVyUF9kRlBEVnlGdk1jZzR5VU5hd1ltSjl0OEF5VkZCMXZoSWZ4RTRlUWNpVndtaW1DU0dwVzgxbElqNkQ2QnpBYlZtcUdkQ251OE9xY2paci1Jc0k0alJUWGJIY25zVTh6ZDhMZUFNWHhMRDJ2OVcyZmhzQms3WGN1NFJzOFRDVFJjY080V1NBQ2VZUVhn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 lkPksW sc-jbiisr-1 hiukpJ" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 cFynzd" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 eFDpwi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 jkkqcL"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dDFcwe"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 kqOtlp"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 bjQKsM"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 hWxisF sc-hez36s-16 gBaKpR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 ifXxYf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 jlvSeZ"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 ghJHgZ"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 bhFQeV"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 gMxIQB"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

This is because &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; can help us “stay vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades”, says Ollie Thompson, personal trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://welltolead.com/"&gt;Welltolead&lt;/a&gt;, a performance-focused health coaching company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the benefits of maintaining healthy muscle are highly underrated,” he says. “Resistance training is crucial for long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – not just from a movement perspective, staying physically strong and mobile, but also for maintaining overall physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent resistance training enhances metabolic function by improving insulin sensitivity, supports cardiovascular health by reducing &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, helps maintain hormonal balance to combat age-related declines, preserves bone density to reduce fracture risk, and strengthens the immune system to help fight off disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to help you build strength, Thompson has shared three &lt;a href="/topic/gyms"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; exercises he believes hold the most value if training for &lt;a href="/topic/longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; is your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-2 epFywa EqCSl"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted chin-up &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian split squat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmer’s carry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 kULwBk fWblEi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on my experience, if we define longevity as living better for longer – with an emphasis on staying vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades – then these are the top three gym exercises for longevity,” says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, they can strengthen muscles across your upper and lower body, boosting joint health, developing balance and coordination, and improving your posture, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anne-hathaway-workout-trainer-plank-b2695184.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one-move workout from Anne Hathaway’s trainer builds core stability in just three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do an assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-12105"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a barbell in a rack at roughly chest height. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on the ground under the barbell then reach overhead and grasp it with an underhand grip, hands roughly shoulder-width apart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your feet on the floor for support, pull your body upwards until your chin is above the bar. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you do this. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly control yourself back to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time, try to provide less support with your feet to make the exercise more challenging, in line with your increasing strength levels. You can also use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance band to perform this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/courteney-cox-chin-up-workout-b2625004.html"&gt;chin-up&lt;/a&gt; has a somewhat intimidating reputation. But by using a machine, resistance band or even a lower pull-up bar and supporting yourself with your feet, Thompson says it can be scaled to suit most fitness levels. And adding it to your regular routine unlocks plenty of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up not only recruits multiple muscles across your back, biceps, forearms and core, but it’s also one of the best things you can do to develop a healthy set of shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key reason I picked the assisted chin-up is that performing a full repetition – from a dead hang to the top with your chin at the bar – takes your shoulder blades through a full range of motion,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the bottom hanging position, with your hands supinated [palms towards you], you create external rotation at the shoulder joint while under load with your arms overhead – an excellent way to maintain strong, stable and well-functioning shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this exercise can’t be beaten for training grip strength, which &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have strongly correlated with healthier muscle mass and better longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/stanley-tucci-workout-b2630043.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Tucci got into the ‘best shape of his life’ at 63 with this training method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-12106"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand one step in front of a bench or sturdy surface that’s around knee height. Face away from this surface. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in your left hand with your arm by your side, palm facing your body. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your right leg long and your hips square, place the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your left knee until it’s just above the ground, keeping your chest up as you do this, then drive through your right foot to return to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up promises to strengthen multiple muscles across your upper body, and the Bulgarian split squat mirrors this for your lower half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a unilateral [single-limb] exercise, it’s excellent for building strength and stability at the hip, knee and foot, helping to correct severe muscular imbalances while also incorporating a balance component,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also challenges kinaesthetic awareness – your ability to sense your position and movement in space – which is a crucial skill for preventing trips and falls in later life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some impressive longevity credentials, and the Bulgarian split squat has another trick up its sleeve that elevates it above standard &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, in Thompson’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a huge fan of this exercise because, when performed correctly, it not only engages every major muscle in the leg but also forces you into hip extension,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This position, where the leg moves behind the hip and midline, tends to weaken significantly with age. Developing strength and mobility in this range plays a key role in maintaining movement quality and walking mechanics, and it can also be instrumental in reducing back pain, hip pain and dysfunction in these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps a day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the farmer’s carry &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-12107"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand with your arms by your side and your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright torso and tight core, walk with the weights. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the farmer’s carry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s carry is a refreshingly straightforward exercise: simply pick up a couple of &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-dumbbells-home-hand-weights-b1847563.html"&gt;dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-set-workout-b1837551.html"&gt;kettlebells&lt;/a&gt; and take them for a walk. This simplicity means it’s overlooked, but Thompson says those who omit it are missing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer’s carry is an exercise I don’t see performed nearly as often as it should be. Here’s why: it’s a full-body movement that involves ambulation, it tests your grip strength and it’s fantastic for improving posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds strong joints, enhances hip stability, challenges your balance, coordination and kinaesthetic awareness, and ultimately provides a brilliant way to build strength while also taxing your aerobic system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will bolster your heart and lung health by having you breathing heavily, while also strengthening your entire body. The farmer’s carry is a viable option for the vast majority of people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often prescribe farmer's carries to my online clients because they are incredibly accessible and can be scaled easily, with progress easily tracked. Simply pick a challenging kettlebell or dumbbell, then walk for time, distance, steps or breaths. This way, you can keep track of how your performance improves over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/kettlebell-training-loaded-carries-b2691274.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘This will change your life’ – An expert strength coach shares the training method missing from your workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other things to consider when training for longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training is Thompson’s top recommendation when exercising for longevity. But he says cardiovascular exercise – activities that raise your heart rate for a sustained period – should also be among your top priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular exercise is, of course, essential for heart health, but it also plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, reducing the risk of major diseases and cancers, supporting brain health, enhancing energy production, improving sleep quality and managing stress,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as resistance training, a well-rounded approach to exercising for longevity includes both low-intensity zone two cardio [performed at roughly 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate] and short bouts of high-intensity training. This combination builds both a wide aerobic base and a high aerobic peak – known as VO2 max – which is strongly associated with better health, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/isle-of-man-wellness-retreat-b2696904.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went on my first wellness retreat, and it wasn’t what I expected at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 17:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNT3oyUTlQWnJEdnQ2bEl1OXVyUF9kRlBEVnlGdk1jZzR5VU5hd1ltSjl0OEF5VkZCMXZoSWZ4RTRlUWNpVndtaW1DU0dwVzgxbElqNkQ2QnpBYlZtcUdkQ251OE9xY2paci1Jc0k0alJUWGJIY25zVTh6ZDhMZUFNWHhMRDJ2OVcyZmhzQms3WGN1NFJzOFRDVFJjY080V1NBQ2VZUVhn</guid></item><item><title>WTF 2.0: Your Local Epidemiologist with Katelyn Jetelina - The Bulwark</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE01SUVKQ2pqdVBIM05UVFlUZTFiWHdITlVuQlY1Vk5PaGFCNVJjdzVyY3l1eTZlRDd2RTlaV1l1ZWdUSWRFSnI0RUUwMUpwTHhzRVJ1cjNHQXdEYnY2NnBBVHZFc1VLSFZEcG9zOFpB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir="auto" class="body markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;JVL talks with Your Local Epidemiologist with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt; about the measles outbreak, public health and misinformation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/wtf-20-your-local-epidemiologist/comments","text":"Leave a comment","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/wtf-20-your-local-epidemiologist/comments" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leave a comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/t/wtf-20" rel&gt;WTF 2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a pop-up show on Substack during the first 100 days of second Trump administration.

&lt;p&gt;Planning a sunny getaway? You might want to pack a mosquito net. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health experts &lt;a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/197/9/E244#msdynmkt_trackingcontext=fed021b2-0f52-49ac-9c7a-72decef20000" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;are warning&lt;/a&gt; about an emerging threat making waves in popular vacation destinations, as cases of the Oropouche virus have been reported in US and Canadian travelers returning from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba and Peru.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While much about the tropical disease remains unknown, the recent spate of infections has raised questions about whether it could become the next Zika virus. Here’s everything you need to know about this potential travel headache.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mosquitoes are believed to play a role in Oropouche virus transmission.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;wirakorn – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the Oropouche virus?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oropouche virus is primarily spread through the bites of small flies called midges, as well as certain species of mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s commonly referred to as “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/health/what-is-sloth-fever-oropouche-virus/"&gt;sloth fever&lt;/a&gt;” because the virus was first identified in the slow-moving mammal, which researchers believe played a key role in its spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since its discovery in 1955, there have been an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5938787/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimated 500,000 cases of Oropouche virus&lt;/a&gt;, mostly around the Amazon Basin. However, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/data-maps/countries-and-territories-at-risk-for-oropouche.html"&gt;starting in late 2023&lt;/a&gt;, the virus has started popping up in new areas of South America and the Caribbean where it hadn’t been seen before, raising concerns about its expanding reach.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;As of March 11, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/data-maps/current-year-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC has identified&lt;/a&gt; 109 cases of sloth fever in US travelers from seven states, including &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2024/2024-09-12_rare_virus.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one case in New York&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the illnesses have been reported in Florida, with 103 cases so far in 2024 and the first three months of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Symptoms to watch for&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re bitten by a mosquito or midge carrying the Oropouche virus, symptoms can appear anywhere from three to 10 days later, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms include a sudden fever and severe headache, often resembling those of other tropical illnesses like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/25/dengue-fever-cases-could-reach-near-record-highs-this-year-what-to-know-about-the-tropical-infectious-disease/#!"&gt;dengue&lt;/a&gt;, chikungunya, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2016/01/28/first-person-account-of-being-stricken-with-the-zika-virus/"&gt;Zika&lt;/a&gt; or malaria. Additional symptoms can include chills, muscle aches, joint pain, light sensitivity, dizziness, pain behind the eyes, nausea, vomiting and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Many of the symptoms of sloth fever are similar to those of other tropical diseases, such as the Zika virus. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dragana Gordic – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In most cases, symptoms last less than a week, with most people fully recovering within a month. However, the CDC notes that some individuals may experience a recurrence of symptoms, either a few days or even weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, the Oropouche virus can cause more severe conditions, such as excessive bleeding, brain swelling, or &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/28/health/guillain-barre-patient-running-nyc-marathon-a-decade-after-diagnosis/"&gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to muscle weakness, numbness and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While fatalities are uncommon, there have been a &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/24-7-2024-qa-oropouche-fever" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;few instances where the virus has proven fatal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Pregnancy risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oropouche virus doesn’t just pose a threat to adults and children — it can also be transmitted from a pregnant person to their unborn fetus, with potentially devastating consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Multiple reports of fetal loss among women with Oropouche virus disease during early and late pregnancy have been reported. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Yakobchuk Olena – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infection during pregnancy has been linked to stillbirths, miscarriages, and other serious risks to the fetus, such as low birth weight, skull collapse, club foot, and microcephaly, a condition where brain development is significantly impaired.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given these risks, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/outbreaks/2024/index.html#:~:text=Oropouche%20virus%20is%20spread%20to,Travel%20Health%20Notice%20for%20Oropouche." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;is advising&lt;/a&gt; pregnant women to reconsider any nonessential travel to areas where &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/oropouche-in-the-americas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Oropouche outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; have recently been reported.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How is sloth fever treated? &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there’s no vaccine to prevent or specific medication to treat Oropouche virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To manage symptoms, the CDC recommends getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers. But don’t reach for aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as they can increase the risk of excessive bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those with more severe symptoms, additional medical care or even hospitalization may be required to ensure proper treatment and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to protect yourself from the Oropouche virus?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To steer clear of the Oropouche virus, your best bet is to minimize exposure to mosquito and midge bites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; wearing loose, long-sleeved shirts and pants when traveling to regions where the virus is circulating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Loose fitting, long-sleeve shirts can help prevent mosquito bites.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;aamulya – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Make sure your accommodations are bug-proof by using window and door screens, or set up a fan outdoors to keep the pests at bay. And of course, don’t forget to bring along insect repellent.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/12/24-1470_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; also found traces of Oropouche virus in the semen of an infected individual for the first time. While no sexual transmission cases have been reported, the CDC suggests that travelers who are worried about contracting or passing the virus through sex to consider using condoms or abstaining from sex during travel and for six weeks after returning home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Could sloth fever start to spread in the US?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Oropouche cases have been reported in American travelers, the risk of widespread transmission in the continental US remains low.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC notes that the US has a different climate and distinct species of mosquitoes and midges compared to those in regions where the virus is common. Additionally, factors like air conditioning make it less likely for the virus to take root. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the agency does warn that infections could still pop up in certain areas. &lt;/p&gt;

Ragweed season may last 6 to 10 weeks until the first frost. Some parts of the U.S. now have pollen year-round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the ranking and how to treat allergy symptoms, visit the AAFA &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/asthma-allergy-research/allergy-capitals/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The CT scan she was scheduled for was a year out, in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, she tried to mitigate her extreme &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;abdominal discomfort&lt;/a&gt; by eating smaller snacks. Still, she was frequently constipated, had pencil-thin stools, and felt a nagging pain in her left side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No matter what I ate, I was in excruciating pain, pretty much yelling for help," Desroches, now 27, told Business Insider. "I knew with my symptoms I wasn't going to make it" to the scan, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desroches was eventually admitted for an emergency &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/get-colonoscopy-colon-cancer-symptoms-colorectal-oncologist-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt; in early 2024, but the procedure couldn't be finished — the tumor in her colon was too big. The GI specialist "couldn't get the camera through," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was diagnosed with stage 4 &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-about-colon-cancer-symptoms-diagnosis-chadwick-boseman" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, given a three-year life expectancy. She's part of the growing demographic of &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colorectal-cancer-high-mortality-young-people-signs-symptoms-disease-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;young people developing colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and wishes colonoscopies were more routine for people under 45 — the recommended minimum age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I had a colonoscopy done, I could have caught this even in stage 2 or 3," she said. "That's the most frustrating part to me, knowing that I shouldn't have to be here fighting stage 4."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="60dcc152-fb2b-4454-94b2-7211b8bd4df5" data-toc-id="60dcc152-fb2b-4454-94b2-7211b8bd4df5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From dismissal to emergency surgery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                                Desroches was admitted to emergency surgery after the discovery of a blockage in her colon.

                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;Desroches started with an&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;MRI in April 2024, which she managed to book thanks to the help of a family friend. When she&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;left the room, her family friend and a GI surgeon were waiting for her. "They were like, 'I don't want to freak you out, but we need to admit you, you have a blockage,'" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;colonoscopy the next morning confirmed it was a tumor, and she&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;was immediately admitted to a six-hour surgery, which removed part of her large intestine where the tumor was located, her right ovary, 13 lymph nodes, and part of the membrane lining her liver. The surgeon couldn't remove the large tumors on the liver itself without causing liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she woke up in the morning with her husband by her side, the surgeon broke the news: she had stage 4 cancer. If they wanted children, the doctor recommended starting &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/39-year-old-woman-spent-6000-on-egg-retrieval-2022-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;egg retrieval&lt;/a&gt; from her left ovary right away, because the cancer was likely to spread quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I remember just almost disassociating," Desroches said. Once the doctors left, she and her husband broke down. "We just had a good cry together and just bawled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2e60a74b-2873-4b49-8249-352a2b73f7da" data-toc-id="2e60a74b-2873-4b49-8249-352a2b73f7da"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching for care options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;Desroches decided to pursue &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cancer-breakthroughs-immunotherapies-and-personalized-treatments-2022-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, a specialized treatment that trains&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;her immune system to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;attack the cancer cells in her body, alongside two chemotherapy drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
                        
                      &lt;p&gt;Chemo became complicated. On round 13 of receiving oxaliplatin, a chemotherapy drug, Desroches went into&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/anaphylaxis" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;anaphylactic shock&lt;/a&gt;, and had to stop taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was probably the scariest feeling I've ever felt, knowing that my body is literally shutting down on me," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the results of her treatment make her nervous: her CT scan in January was the first one in which her tumors didn't shrink. She doesn't know what to anticipate for her next one, in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Desroches is searching for other options. The surgery she needs, a hepatic arterial infusion pump to deliver chemotherapy drugs directly into her liver, is only available as a clinical trial in Canada — one she doesn't qualify for because she has cancer outside her liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure is more routine in the US, but her oncologist said the treatment could cost $500,000 or more when considering testing, a US hospital stay, and treating any complications — something that isn't financially feasible for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's now looking into options in Europe and started a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/shannins-cancer-fight" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; for her cancer treatments. "It's very overwhelming, but when you're in fight-or-flight mode for your life, it doesn't matter," she said. "You just do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="929fd71e-d669-4184-979b-f757825e52ad" data-toc-id="929fd71e-d669-4184-979b-f757825e52ad"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing on the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;Since starting treatment in 2024, Desroches and her family are trying to stay optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Desroches married her husband, Cody Desroches, at a beachside wedding in Jamaica. "I would do anything to go&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;back to that day," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're planning to have kids, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week after her surgery, Desroches met with a fertility doctor to begin her egg-freezing process immediately. "This was the most pain I've ever been in," she said. She was nauseous from the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/egg-freezing-fertility-clinics-targeting-gen-z-women-high-cost-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;hormone injections&lt;/a&gt;, dry-heaving so hard that she felt her surgical staples would rip open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her surgeries, she said she'll never be able to carry her own child, but hopes she and her husband can use a &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/surrogate-paid-22500-and-30000-twice-said-experience-was-empowering-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;surrogate&lt;/a&gt; one day.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;It's hard to picture her future, she said. "It's just natural when you're at this age — you're always thinking about what's next," whether it's planning a trip, renovating her house, or having kids. At the same time, she never knows if she can commit to a family gathering or if she'll feel too sick to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She savors every moment with her loved ones, a contrast to her "busybody" life as a nurse prior to cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I try not to focus on that three-year mark because that's just a statistic," she said. "That's not me."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding was made through the society’s &lt;a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/about-the-society/who-we-are/research-we-fund/fast-forward-commercial"&gt;Fast Forward program&lt;/a&gt;, which seeks to bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical development for new therapies and diagnostic tools that address disease progression and progressive forms of MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://myrotx.com/"&gt;Myrobalan&lt;/a&gt;‘s experimental therapy MRO-002 is a GPR17 antagonist, or inhibitor, that’s designed to promote myelin repair in people with MS and other demyelinating conditions. With the grant, the company will conduct additional preclinical experiments to determine if it may have therapeutic benefits in progressive MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to receive the Fast Forward grant from the National MS Society and appreciate their confidence in our drug development approach,” Jing Wang, PhD, CEO and co-founder of Myrobalan, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250312951560/en/Myrobalan-Therapeutics-Awarded-a-Grant-from-the-National-Multiple-Sclerosis-Society-to-Advance-Development-of-MRO-002-in-Multiple-Sclerosis"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;. “We believe that MRO-002 has the potential to promote myelin repair in neurodegenerative diseases, demyelinating disorders, and conditions involving recovery from [central nervous system] injury.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Finding ways to aid myelin repair&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/"&gt;myelin sheath&lt;/a&gt;, a fatty coating around nerve cells. Like an insulator on electrical wires, myelin protects nerve fibers and ensures the efficient transmission of nerve signals. When it’s lost, patients experience a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;range of symptoms&lt;/a&gt; related to disrupted nerve signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes, specialized cells in the brain and spinal cord. While existing oligodendrocytes have some ability to repair damaged myelin or restore lost myelin, the remyelination process isn’t very efficient in MS due to ongoing inflammation. There’s also insufficient maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into fully functional oligodendrocytes that are able to produce myelin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key challenge in MS treatment is the repair of damaged myelin. While available &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapies&lt;/a&gt; help reduce relapses and slow disease progression, their ability to repair myelin and reverse disability is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding therapies that can improve remyelination has been a longstanding goal in MS research. One promising approach involves targeting GPR17, a receptor in OPCs that prevents the cells from maturing into fully functional oligodendrocytes, thereby limiting myelin repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRO-002 is a highly selective GPR17 antagonist that can cross the blood-brain barrier, the protective membrane that restricts the passage of most substances from the bloodstream into the brain. This ability lets it reach the brain and remove this brake from OPCs, causing them to mature and boosting the production of new myelin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preclinical studies on human-derived oligodendrocytes and animal models of demyelination &lt;a href="https://myrotx.com/news/myrobalan-to-present-gpr17-antagonist-preclinical-data-at-ectrims-2024/"&gt;have shown encouraging results&lt;/a&gt;. MRO-002 significantly boosted the maturation of oligodendrocytes in both models, resulting in enhanced remyelination in the brains of the animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With support from the National MS Society, the company hopes to conduct additional studies to support MRO-002’s development toward clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having a therapy that promotes myelin repair would have tremendous implications for people living with MS,” said Walter Kostich, PhD, associate vice president of translational research at the National MS Society. “We are happy to support Myrobalan Therapeutics’ preclinical testing of MRO-002 and look forward to learning whether it has translational potential for people with MS.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A United Nations food agency warned that the continued spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus is an unprecedented food security risk that requires a coordinated global response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a briefing held on Monday, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations cited the loss of hundreds of millions of poultry around the world and the increasing spillover into mammals as key concerns stemming from the spread of the H5N1 bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The agency noted a major shift in bird flu’s geographic spread in the past four years, with at least 300 newly affected wild bird species since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Calling the spread unprecedented, FAO Deputy Director-General Godfrey Magwenzi said the disease was “leading to serious impacts on food security and food supply in countries, including loss of valuable nutrition, rural jobs and income, shocks to local economies, and of course increasing costs to consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FAO Deputy Director-General Beth Bechdol called for a coordinated global response, saying, “A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. By working together, we can reduce the impact of avian influenza and protect both animal and human health – locally and globally.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency called on countries to enhance surveillance and reporting of bird flu; improve lab capacity; develop and implement preparedness plans; consider vaccinations in the response; and to promote risk management through biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. has 70 cases of bird flu, including 41 cattle herds as well as 24 poultry farms and culling operations. As a zoological disease, there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission so far and the risk to the public remains low.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Department of Agriculture &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/usda-invests-1-billion-combat-avian-flu-and-reduce-egg-prices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;released a plan&lt;/a&gt; to invest $1 billion to combat the bird flu and reduce egg prices.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In Mississippi, a strain of highly pathogenic bird flu that hasn’t been seen in the U.S. since 2017 was &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5199450-mississippi-reports-first-outbreak-of-highly-pathogenic-bird-flu-strain-in-us-since-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported in a commercial flock&lt;/a&gt;. This occurrence is believed to be unrelated to the current H5N1 spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disease has been credited with causing egg prices to spike, and restaurants have begun implementing surcharges for egg dishes. The Justice Department, however, is also &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-investigating-major-egg-producers-amid-soaring-prices/story?id=119589959" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reportedly investigating&lt;/a&gt; whether major egg producers are colluding to increase prices while using the bird flu situation as a cover.&lt;/p&gt;

Stop immediately if you experience pain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem hard to believe, but snacking several times a day can boost your health and fitness — exercise snacking, that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise snacks” are short bursts of activity — 30 seconds to five or 10 minutes max — that encompass almost any type of movement. Think climbing stairs, walking, doing squats or dancing. The term is thought to have been first used in 2007 by cardiologist Dr. Howard Hartley, who was then associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Today, numerous studies prove the value of these mini workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performing 15- to 30-second exercise snacks three times daily was shown to improve the cardiorespiratory fitness levels and exercise performance in inactive adults, according to a small January 2022 study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/fulltext/2022/01000/exercise_snacks__a_novel_strategy_to_improve.5.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews&lt;/a&gt;. The “snacks” in the study were stair-climbing and cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults who reported they didn’t work out saw a 17% to 18% reduction in cancer incidence after they began doing just 3.4 to 3.6 minutes of vigorous physical activity daily, a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10375384/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:July 2023 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;July 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; of 22,398 people found. Their daily physical activity was done in bursts lasting less than one or two minutes. Hitting 4.5 minutes of vigorous, intermittent physical activity each day was associated with a 31% to 32% reduction in cancer incidence, according to the study published in JAMA Oncology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of movement extend to brain health, too. Doing even a small amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day, or adding a small amount to your current exercise regimen, reduces your risk of dementia, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:March study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;March study&lt;/a&gt; in JAMDA: The Journal of the Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medical Association. Those who hadn’t been doing any moderate to vigorous exercise received the largest benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doing anything is better than doing nothing,” said Michael Betts, a personal trainer and director at TrainFitness who’s based in London. “As long as you’re moving some of the time, putting a little stress on your body, it will adapt and improve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Climbing the stairs as you go about your day can be one way to work in an exercise snack. - South_agency/E+/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Small changes can result in big rewards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise snacks are a favorite tool used by Dr. Supatra Tovar, owner of Dr. Supatra Tovar &amp;amp; Associates, a holistic health clinical psychology practice in Pasadena, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a big proponent of behavior change that starts tiny,” Tovar said. “So I like to create behaviors with my clients that are easy, accessible and doable every to most every day of the week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to making tiny, new changes stick is to tie them to a behavior you do every day at the same time, Tovar said. For example, if you immediately brush your teeth upon waking up, start doing a few jumping jacks or lunges as soon as you set down your toothbrush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you incorporate exercise snacks as a habit, they start to become ingrained, and you’ll begin to see their lifelong benefits,” Tovar said. “Anyone I’ve given these to have reported back that they had no idea how much of a positive difference they would make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is one of the easiest exercise snacks, according to Tovar and Betts. It can entail a stroll around your neighborhood or just a lap around your living room. Once you get in the habit of walking a little each day, you can progress to doing intervals, increasing your pace for 20 seconds, slowing down for 10 and then repeating several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It pushes your body a little more each time,” Betts said, “after which your body adapts and improves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t rely just on walking. Wall push-ups will build strength in your arms, for example, while squats are great for beefing up your leg strength. If you want to be able to climb stairs without getting out of breath, start walking up and down stairs a little more quickly than you normally would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s always an exercise snack that can help improve each part of your body in some way,” Betts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also make any exercise snack more difficult if it becomes too easy. A wall push-up can progress to one performed on the floor, while a chair squat can become an air squat. An easy stroll can turn into a light jog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Exercise snacks are a NEAT hack&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise snacks don’t have to be a specific type of activity, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cleaning your house is exercise,” said Tovar, who is a fan of NEAT movements. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12468415/#:~:text=Non%2Dexercise%20activity%20thermogenesis%20(NEAT)%20is%20the%20energy%20expended,undertaking%20agricultural%20tasks%20and%20fidgeting." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NEAT;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NEAT&lt;/a&gt;, or nonexercise activity thermogenesis, refers to the energy expended from all physical activities that aren’t structured exercise. Doing chores, playing with your kids and even fidgeting are all forms of NEAT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tovar points to people living in “blue zones,” which are areas around the globe where people routinely live long and healthy lives, such as Okinawa, Japan, and the Italian island of Sardinia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re moving all of the time, doing NEAT exercise all day long,” she said, whether that’s walking to the store, squatting to garden, carrying groceries or doing chores. “NEAT exercise can burn up to 2,000 extra calories per day if you’re constantly moving throughout the day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that motion is welcomed by the body and not a detriment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your body is kind of lazy,” Betts said. “It doesn’t like to do much and will slowly deteriorate over time without use. Doing these little exercise snacks reminds your body that it does need to work to maintain and improve its overall function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/fitness-life-but-better" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thethousandmiler.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melanie Radzicki McManus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Melanie Radzicki McManus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:14:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE45Q0dReWpLRHgxV3ZVMXZRRUpFM3FNS0lvWWR1VGFZTXlpUEhZdURsVDBzM0xrM25iMlZRZW1ITFNEcUk2RGVSaWpNWWlqbzFJMVNrMDVYdEMxQlc2U3JaS1oybjFBU2JDdnhuaWtvRDV5d1k</guid></item><item><title>7 Important Ways To Look After Your Teeth - Rediff.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOcmZ4Rkw1TGh2NDd3SE9oTkJUSmlLbUJTWjdiTjdnc2tCQWc1bHJoVHpINTdWUGNLZ0ZnQXdzQkZhSXZWZ3NFM0l5WFRwTnNJTnpUb190ZW5SazB5STc0ZXJ5WlU0c1YwN2hOZ2RvQlcyc0pwVDMxTm44R3JiTTBocDRtdXhiUVhqcjNkWkRwcm81Vno4OXZQVW5tMl80LTFvU1RHYlhla9IBpwFBVV95cUxOcmZ4Rkw1TGh2NDd3SE9oTkJUSmlLbUJTWjdiTjdnc2tCQWc1bHJoVHpINTdWUGNLZ0ZnQXdzQkZhSXZWZ3NFM0l5WFRwTnNJTnpUb190ZW5SazB5STc0ZXJ5WlU0c1YwN2hOZ2RvQlcyc0pwVDMxTm44R3JiTTBocDRtdXhiUVhqcjNkWkRwcm81Vno4OXZQVW5tMl80LTFvU1RHYlhlaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="contents cover" animate-in="fly-in-bottom" animate-in-duration="1s"&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — Alma Rivera, 35, is expecting her first child next month. But during the pregnancy she developed gestational diabetes, so her doctor decided she and her baby would benefit from specialized nutrition counseling and access to food that's good specifically to counter diabetes. The doctor sent her with a prescription to the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oswald "Oz" Hutton, 60, of Salt Lake City, has battled hypertension, arthritis and chronic pain. What you eat makes a difference there, too, so the U.S. Marine Corps veteran opted into nutritional education and access to high quality produce courtesy of a program that's a partnership between the Rockefeller Foundation and the Veterans Health Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those two programs — and scores of others — are part of the "Food Is Medicine" movement, the belief that what people eat helps determine their health on many levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ellen Maxfield, University of Utah Health clinical operations associate director, grabs food for a patient at the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you think about the drivers of health, dietary risk factors are shown to be the most important modifiable risk factor for chronic disease and death. Yet in health care, we don't really talk about that much," said Dr. Amy Locke, whose many titles include chief wellness officer at University of Utah Health, professor and co-director of the Driving Out Diabetes Initiative at the Osher Center for Integrative Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locke said modifiable health risk factors are about 20% clinical, 30% behaviors like getting enough sleep or eating well, roughly 10% physical environment and 40% socioeconomic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have good health care and you have good socioeconomic status, it's easier to eat a healthy diet," she told Deseret News. "What we want to do is use the health care space to leverage those other buckets as much as possible, so we are doing a bunch of 'Food Is Medicine'-related things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government, health care providers, nonprofits, academics and others are embracing the concept that you can be healthier or sicker depending on what you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, gives two bags of food to Alma Rivera, who is eight months pregnant and has gestational diabetes, from the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health firmly tied together food and health in its call to end hunger and reduce chronic disease by 2030, as the &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/food-medicine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion&lt;/a&gt; reports. The office said 60% of U.S. adults have some diet-related chronic disease that the right food — and avoiding the wrong ones — can impact. At the same time, there are 18 million people whose households experience food insecurity. The result is an estimated $4 trillion in health care spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deseret News looked at two of the dozens of examples of "Food Is Medicine" programs. How programs operate and who they target varies. But many of them — including the University of Utah Food Pharmacy and the pilot project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation involving Salt Lake area veterans who receive services at the VA — share certain traits: The beneficiaries like Hutton and Rivera have medical conditions that food impacts. Participants are considered food insecure and meet income qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programs also both have strong education components to help those benefiting understand why food matters, how to make good food choices and even how easy it is to make good meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also both provide actual food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Food is pictured in the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Helping veterans get healthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Veterans Health Administration hosted a bipartisan Congressional event last week to tout its partnership with the foundation, which just made a $100 million commitment to Food Is Medicine programs, building on its prescription pilot projects in Utah and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects are being launched in Maryland and New York, with partners including the VA, Instacart, Syracuse University, University of Utah, 4P Foods, as well as in North Carolina, Duke University and Reinvestment Partners. The programs have different designs to meet needs in the areas they serve. But the classes, resources and prescriptions are tailored specifically to patients and their chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hutton is one of 275 veterans in the Utah pilot; the programs combined hope to help 2,000 veterans, while gathering research and looking for ways to tackle diet-related diseases like diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure among U.S. veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with food education, veterans in the program are given gift cards worth $100 a month that can be used to buy fruits and vegetables at participating stores. The program lasts 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retired four-star U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis, foundation board chair, said access to healthy food improves mental and physical health while lowering the cost of health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, helps a patient choose groceries at the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health has reported that three-quarters of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan were overweight or obese when they first went to a VA clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah Cohen-Cline, director of the Rockefeller Foundation initiative, said the program uses Food Is Medicine initiatives like produce prescriptions, meals tailored to medical needs and groceries that can be prescribed by a clinician as part of medical treatment, "with the big-picture goal of seeing these interventions formally integrated into health care as a covered medical benefit." These pilot projects are testing programs and measuring outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation would love to expand it to all eligible veterans, including 116,000 in Utah, but Cohen-Cline said philanthropies alone can't meet the need; that requires funding from other sources, including health care systems and insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it saves money and improves quality of life, making it a great investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ellen Maxfield, University of Utah Health clinical operations associate director, and Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, help a patient choose food from the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday.

You should not show up at a medical facility and not have the opportunity to talk about food," Locke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/03/17/food-medicine-prescription-fruits-vegetables-vets-disease-education/" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Read the full article at Deseret.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Well, someone undertook to answer one of my questions.  And the answer is disturbing. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/aging-might-not-be-enough-eliminate-h5n1-viruses-raw-milk-cheese" target="_blank"&gt;Aging may not eliminate H5N1 virus in raw-milk cheese.&lt;/a&gt; While the FDA has been sampling commercially available raw-milk cheese and has not found any viable virus, Cornell University undertook to make and age cheese with milk deliberately spiked with the virus at different pH levels.  Only the most acidic environment deactivated the virus, the other cheeses still had infectious virions at 60 days aging.  They also note that the virus can persist under refrigeration for 56 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More confirmations in US dairy cows, mammals, and poultry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In outbreak developments, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed two more H5N1 in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" target="_blank"&gt;dairy cattle&lt;/a&gt;, both from Idaho, raising the national total to 985. Idaho has now reported three detections over the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://agri.idaho.gov/animals/animal-disease/hpai-in-cattle/" target="_blank"&gt;Idaho State Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;said three facilities are currently quarantined, all from Gooding County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, APHIS reported nine more detections in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank"&gt;mammals&lt;/a&gt;, including domestic cats from New Jersey, Idaho, and Kansas. Officials also confirmed H5N1 in a harbor seal from Washington and mice from Missouri’s Newton County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In poultry developments, APHIS confirmed more detections in backyard poultry from five states, including Iowa, Nebraska, New York, Colorado, and Indiana, along with detections in two more live poultry markets in New York, one in Queens and the other in Kings County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;A study of an affected dairy herd&lt;/u&gt; estimated the costs of infection at $950 per clinically affected cow.  But they also found some asymptomatic cases, and even in dry cows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/h5n1-dairy-cow-study-finds-sustained-milk-production-drop-extensive" target="_blank"&gt;Milk production loss lasted at least 60 days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And only 56% of Americans know that drinking raw milk is dangerous. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/u-penn-survey-shows-only-56-americans-understand-drinking-raw-milk-risky" target="_blank"&gt;Deep sigh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The world is being urged &lt;/u&gt;to step up efforts against bird flu.  And tests in mice and human cells show that the bovine strain now current in the US is more pathogenic than an earlier bird strain isolated in Mongolia 20 years ago. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/fao-urges-nations-ramp-actions-blunt-impact-h5n1-avian-flu" target="_blank"&gt;Fair warning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Mississippi broiler farm&lt;/u&gt; has had an outbreak of a different subtype of highly pathogenic avian flu, H7N9, which is North American in origin, and has not been detected in US poultry since 2017. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/h7n9-avian-flu-strikes-mississippi-broiler-farm" target="_blank"&gt;Birds were euthanized.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Measles&lt;/u&gt;: it's not just us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/vermont-reports-measles-case-europe-warns-highest-case-count-25-years" target="_blank"&gt;Europe is having its worst measles year in decades.&lt;/a&gt; and the numbers are oddly at variance with those from a similar source I cited a few days ago.  (??)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a Mennonite community in Mexico now has measles &lt;a href="https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8722818" target="_blank"&gt;Thought to have been brought from relatives in Texas.&lt;/a&gt;. Don't give me that "immigrants bring diseases into the US" crap.  Children in Mexico's public schools get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;A study has found &lt;/u&gt;that a commercially available probiotic reduced the duration of fever in children &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/trial-links-probiotics-fever-reduction-kids-respiratory-infections" target="_blank"&gt;with respiratory infections.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Saudi Arabia reported &lt;/u&gt;four MERS infections in the last six months, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/trial-links-probiotics-fever-reduction-kids-respiratory-infections" target="_blank"&gt;Two of them fatal&lt;/a&gt;.  MERS is a zoonotic coronavirus which has rarely managed the human-to-human route.  It is endemic in camels and occasionally passes from a camel to a human. There were no secondary infections in the contacts of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The FDA is investigating&lt;/u&gt; a new &lt;a href="https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/03/fda-detects-new-listeria-outbreak-investigations-of-other-outbreaks-continue/" target="_blank"&gt;Listeria outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.  The source has not been identified. A Salmonella outbreak has been declared over with no specific source identified.&lt;/p&gt;

(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The good news? Exercise can help and this study shed light on which type works best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Key findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed clinical trials published up to October 2022, comparing different forms of physical exercise with routine activities, standard care, or sleep education. All participants had been formally diagnosed with insomnia and their sleep quality was measured using the Global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (GPSQI).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study reviewed data from 24 clinical trials involving 2,045 adults aged 60 and older, with an average age of 70. Most of these trials took place in Asia (56%), followed by North America (16%), South America (16%), and Europe (12%). One in five were conducted in nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Which exercises were studied?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed different types of exercise, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aerobic exercise – Activities like cycling, brisk walking, swimming, and dancing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resistance training – Weightlifting, push-ups, squats and planks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balance exercises – Movements like heel-to-toe walking and step-ups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexibility exercises – Yoga, Pilates, and stretching routines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combination exercise – A mix of strength, aerobic, balance and flexibility workouts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average exercise session lasted around 50 minutes, with participants working out two to three times per week for about 14 weeks. However, due to limited data, the meta-analysis focused primarily on aerobic and combination exercises, with the impact of resistance training extrapolated through network analysis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How much did sleep improve?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strength training improved sleep the most, boosting GPSQI scores by 5.75 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aerobic exercise improved scores by 3.76 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combination exercise improved scores by 2.54 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep education helped but was less effective than strength training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sleep education did show benefits, the study noted inconsistencies in how it was defined across trials, making it difficult to assess its full impact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why strength training works best&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the experts, strength training may enhance sleep by reducing stress, improving metabolism and promoting the release of sleep-regulating hormones. Unlike high-intensity aerobic workouts, resistance training does not overstimulate the nervous system, making it easier for older adults to wind down before bed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The takeaway: Exercise your way to better sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all forms of exercise are beneficial, resistance training appears to have the greatest impact on sleep quality for older adults. If you are looking for a natural way to improve your sleep, consider adding strength training to your routine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/06/original/shutterstock_1555847276_1741253064032.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Strength training, aerobic training and combination activities can help in regularising sleep.(Shutterstock)" title="Strength training, aerobic training and combination activities can help in regularising sleep.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Strength training, aerobic training and combination activities can help in regularising sleep.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether it is lifting weights, doing bodyweight exercises or using resistance bands, a little strength work could lead to more restful nights and better overall health.

What happened?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“People tend to think of allergies as a childhood thing” and not something they can get later in life, said Dr. Tolly Epstein, an adjunct assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine who researches allergies and immunology. But “it’s very common to develop new allergies,” especially in your 20s, 30s and 40s, she said. And the symptoms aren’t always obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Most people with seasonal allergies will have sneezing, itchy eyes or nasal congestion. But those can also be accompanied by fatigue, a headache or sinus pressure — which, if you’ve never faced allergies before, you might mistake as cold symptoms, Dr. Epstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you’ve recently developed a pollen allergy, you might also experience itching in your mouth after eating certain raw fruits and vegetables, said Dr. Andrew Rorie, an assistant professor in the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. That’s because the immune system sometimes confuses proteins in the plants for pollen proteins, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-25133f37"&gt;What causes seasonal allergies to develop?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Seasonal allergies are reactions to environmental elements like pollen or mold spores that tend to swirl around in the air during certain times — such as in the spring, when plants pollinate. When you’re allergic to something like pollen, your immune system perceives it as a threat and triggers a chain reaction at the point of exposure. Antibodies in the nose or lungs stimulate the release of chemicals like histamine, which can lead to the sneezing, runny nose or congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists aren’t exactly sure why you can develop new allergies or symptoms without ever having had them before, but there are several potential causes. For one, climate change is causing allergy season to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/well/live/spring-allergy-symptoms.html" title=""&gt;start earlier and last longer&lt;/a&gt;, so it makes people more prone to developing symptoms, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

The above picture is a stock image of a child suffering from measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is one of the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14447249/us-states-red-alert-measles-outbreak-kills-infects.html"&gt;most infectious diseases known to man&lt;/a&gt;, able to infect nine out of ten unvaccinated people that are exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr David Persse, chief medical officer for Houston, urged people to get vaccinated against measles to slash their risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from measles is through vaccination,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is safe, highly effective, and remains the best defense against this potentially severe disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Although measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, international travel continues to present a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Staying up to date on vaccinations helps protect both individuals and the broader community.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 92 percent of kindergarteners across Texas were vaccinated against measles in 2023 to 2024, the latest data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is below the 95 percent level experts say is needed to prevent an outbreak, and below the levels recorded in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the Houston area, three of its private schools are among those with the lowest vaccination rates in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acton Leadership Academy of Magnolia, north of the city, had a measles vaccination rate of 36 percent in 2023 to 2024, according to state data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acton Academy Cy-Fair, in northwest Houston, had a measles vaccination rate of 50 percent for kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a stock image of the skyline in Houston, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Acton Leadership Academy of Creekside, in Spring, also had a measles vaccination rate of 50 percent for the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two cases recorded in the city in January were in two unvaccinated adults living in the same household who had recently returned to the city from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their cases also were not linked to the major outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is one of the most infectious diseases known to man, and can infect nine in every ten people exposed to it who are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It spreads via respiratory droplets expelled in coughs and sneezes that hang in the air and remain infectious for up to two hours after a patient has passed through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms erupt seven to 14 days after infection, and begin as a high fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients also suffer from a red, blotchy rash that starts on the face and then extends behind the ears and down the trunk to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Serious complications can occur in young children or those with a weakened immune system, who may suffer from pneumonia, brain swelling and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles has a fatality rate of one to two children in every thousand who are infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The best way to prevent the infection is to be vaccinated, with the first dose given around six months and the second at the ages four to six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for the disease includes providing medications to help relieve symptoms and bed rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

CDCHAN-00523&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cdc-textblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is issuing this Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Update to provide additional information to healthcare providers, public health departments, and the public about the ongoing risk of dengue virus (DENV) infections and updates to testing recommendations in the United States. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/outbreaks/2024/index.html"&gt;Dengue activity remains high in some parts of the United States&lt;/a&gt; and globally, with many countries reporting higher-than-usual number of &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/dengue-global"&gt;dengue cases&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 and 2025. Healthcare providers, public health departments, and the public are urged to continue to take steps to prevent, detect, diagnose, and respond to dengue as described in the June 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00511.html"&gt;HAN Health Advisory (CDCHAN-00511)&lt;/a&gt; on dengue in the United States. Updates include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dengue virus transmission remains high in the Americas region, including in the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Spring and summer travel coincide with the peak season for dengue in many countries, increasing the risk of both travel-associated and locally acquired cases in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/hcp/diagnosis-testing/cdc-denv-1-4-real-time-rt-pcr-multiplex-assay.html"&gt;CDC DENV-1-4 real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay&lt;/a&gt; when dengue is the most likely diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New resources are available for public health professionals including a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/php/resources/medical_records_review.html"&gt;job aid&lt;/a&gt; for reviewing medical records and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/media/pdfs/2024/08/response_to_dengue.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;guidance&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for investigating and responding to dengue cases in non-endemic areas of the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/about/index.html"&gt;Dengue&lt;/a&gt; is caused by four distinct but closely related dengue viruses or serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4). Infection with one DENV usually induces lifelong immunity to that serotype and short-term immunity to other DENV serotypes for months to years. Repeat infections with different serotypes can occur, particularly in DENV endemic areas. Approximately one in four DENV infections are symptomatic. Infection with any DENV serotype can cause severe illness, particularly in infants aged ≤1 year, pregnant women, adults aged ≥65 years, people with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/media/pdfs/2024/05/20240521_342849-B_PRESS_READY_PocketGuideDCMC_UPDATE.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;certain medical conditions&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and people with previous DENV infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, dengue cases have &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON518" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="int"&gt;increased substantially in the last 5 years&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with the most pronounced increases occurring in the Americas. &lt;a href="https://www3.paho.org/data/index.php/en/mnu-topics/indicadores-dengue-en.html" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="org"&gt;In the Americas region&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 4.6 million cases and 2,400 deaths were reported in 2023, followed by 13 million cases and 8,200 deaths in 2024. As of March 6, more than 760,000 dengue cases have been reported in 2025, which is a 15% increase compared to the previous 5-year average. Epidemics in the Americas region are expected to increase both travel-associated cases and the possibility of local transmission in the continental United States in areas with competent mosquito vectors. Spring and summer travel in the United States overlaps with the months of increased seasonal dengue activity in many countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four DENV serotypes were reported among travelers returning to the United States in 2024. DENV-3 was the most common serotype identified in 2024, but the proportion of cases caused by DENV-4 has been increasing in recent months. During October 2024–January 2025, DENV-4 was identified in 50% of travel-associated dengue cases among cases with DENV serotype available. In addition, &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-2-2025-paho-warns-increased-risk-dengue-outbreaks-due-circulation-denv-3-americas" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="org"&gt;DENV-3 has re-emerged after a prolonged absence in multiple countries&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; across the Americas region during 2024 and 2025. Introductions of new serotypes have been associated with increasing size and frequency of dengue outbreaks, as well as more severe clinical outcomes in patients with previous DENV exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Puerto Rico, reported dengue cases have remained above the outbreak threshold since February 2024. A public health emergency was declared in March 2024 and remains in effect. In 2024, &lt;a href="https://datos.salud.pr.gov/arbovirus/publications" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;6,291 cases were reported&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, more than 52% (3,292) required hospitalization and there were 13 deaths. As of March 7, 2025, 936 cases have been reported, representing a 113% increase compared to the same period in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. Virgin Islands, a dengue outbreak was declared in August 2024 and remains in effect. A total of 208 locally acquired cases were identified in 2024, and 30 in 2025 as of March 7, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the continental United States in 2024, locally acquired cases were reported in &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-borne-diseases/_documents/2025-7-arbovirus-surveillance.pdf" target="_blank" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;Florida&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (91), California (18), and Texas (1). A record number of dengue cases were identified among U.S. travelers (3,483 cases), which is an 84% increase compared to the previous year. This trend is expected to continue with increased dengue activity in endemic areas in 2025. The highest numbers of travel-associated cases in 2024 were reported in &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-borne-diseases/_documents/2025-7-arbovirus-surveillance.pdf" target="_blank" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;Florida&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1,016) followed by &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/DengueInfectionsUpdate.aspx" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;California&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (648), and New York (327).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC will continue to support state, tribal, local, and territorial public health partners; clinicians; and public health laboratories in case detection, surveillance, and outreach to respond to the ongoing threat of dengue in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare Providers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review and be familiar with the recommendations for healthcare providers in the June 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00511.html"&gt;HAN (CDCHAN-00511)&lt;/a&gt; on dengue in the United States. This includes information about reporting cases, clinical presentation and care (including severe dengue), vaccination, testing, and patient outreach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a thorough travel history for patients presenting with acute febrile illness as initial clinical presentation is similar among many vector-borne diseases such as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/index.html"&gt;dengue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html"&gt;Zika&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/about/index.html"&gt;chikungunya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/about/index.html"&gt;Oropouche&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advise patients who plan to travel to take steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after returning, especially if traveling to an area with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/areas-with-risk/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/areaswithrisk/around-the-world.html"&gt;frequent or continuous dengue transmission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to have increased suspicion of dengue among people with fever who have been in areas with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/areas-with-risk/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/areaswithrisk/around-the-world.html"&gt;frequent or continuous dengue transmission&lt;/a&gt; within 14 days before illness onset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients with suspected DENV infection should be tested with RT-PCR (i.e., a nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT]) or an NS1 antigen test, as well as with an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody test. These tests are available from commercial laboratories and public health laboratories. You can contact your &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-gateway/php/communications-resources/health-department-directories.html"&gt;state or local health department&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate dengue diagnostic testing.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These tests can be considered regardless of the symptom onset date, although the sensitivity of RT-PCR and NS1 antigen tests decrease after the first 7 days of symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the patient test negative for dengue, consider testing for other infectious diseases that might be occurring in the location where the patient was likely exposed. Zika, chikungunya, and Oropouche can all have similar clinical signs and symptoms and often circulate in the same areas as dengue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for Health Departments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review and be familiar with the recommendations for state, tribal, local, and territorial Health Departments in the June 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00511.html"&gt;HAN (CDCHAN-00511) on dengue in the United States&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider using the new &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/php/resources/medical_records_review.html"&gt;job aid for reviewing dengue medical records&lt;/a&gt; when reviewing data from medical records for case investigations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When selecting an RT-PCR assay, use the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/hcp/diagnosis-testing/cdc-denv-1-4-real-time-rt-pcr-multiplex-assay.html"&gt;CDC DENV-1-4 Real Time RT-PCR Assay&lt;/a&gt; when dengue is the most likely diagnosis. Use the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/123606/download" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;Trioplex Real Time RT-PCR assay&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (approved under an Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration), when Zika is the most likely diagnosis. For samples testing negative for dengue, consider RT-PCR testing for Oropouche virus (OROV) based on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/data-maps/countries-and-territories-at-risk-for-oropouche.html"&gt;recent OROV circulation in locations visited.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trioplex Real Time RT-PCR assay, which simultaneously tests for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, is less sensitive for DENV-4 compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/hcp/diagnosis-testing/cdc-denv-1-4-real-time-rt-pcr-multiplex-assay.html"&gt;DENV-1-4 Real Time RT-PCR assay&lt;/a&gt;, and DENV-4 has been detected more frequently among travelers returning to the United States in recent months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public health laboratories can request technical support and test kits at &lt;a href="mailto:denguePCRordering@cdc.gov"&gt;denguePCRordering@cdc.gov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="mailto:trioplexPCRordering@cdc.gov"&gt;trioplexPCRordering@cdc.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oropouche RT-PCR testing is available commercially and at selected state health departments and CDC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigate, report, and respond to dengue cases and outbreaks in endemic and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/media/pdfs/2024/08/response_to_dengue.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;non-endemic areas of the United States.&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share guidance with the public about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/prevention/index.html"&gt;preventing dengue&lt;/a&gt; and other vector-borne disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for the Public&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For More Information &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For Healthcare Providers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For Health Departments and Public Health Professionals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the Public&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Your body adjusts, but it's a wonky time,' Pamela explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The thing with menopause, and perimenopause, is our bodies change, and it may not be comfortable in the beginning, some women can have hot flashes and other kinds of symptoms that are annoying, but they pass for most women, it's a transitional stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It doesn't last forever, and we're getting smarter now about menopause, and we're getting more educated, and most women in menopause do really well with estrogen and testosterone - with your hormones that they're losing during menopause - and when we get estrogen replaced, of which we naturally lose, it's like getting an incredible boost to shock.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pamela Madsen, a somatic sex educator, revealed what sex is like after menopause&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said women are 'starving' and need to be fed before the work begins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pamela also called menopause a 'second adolescence' for women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'If you give her an estrogen testosterone cream, she's right back in the game. Pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People should consult their doctors, but in my experience of working with so many mid-life women, they don't even need a lot of hormone replacement. They just need a little help.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pamela broke down her Back to the Body retreats that allow women to get in touch with their sexual selves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said many women join her program who have had inadequate lovers or lovers who have never cared about their sexual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They come in starving. So before we can get anywhere in helping them cultivate their erotic energy, we go through, literally, a period of feeding because they're so hungry,' she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The work, initially, with a menopausal woman, is getting her out of erotic poverty and getting her to a place where she's not starving anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And then once we get her there, then we can support women to go even deeper into what is possible for themselves, erotically, like, "What turns you on? What do you want?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have women say to me, no one has ever asked me that question before. What do I want? A lot of the work with women is about helping them find their desire, taking them out of starvation, and letting them know that this is important for their overall health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She further explained that despite what the media might tell you- women have 'ever-growing eroticism' even after menopause&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pamela further explained that despite what the mainstream might tell you - women have 'ever-growing eroticism' even after menopause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/menopause/index.html" id="mol-2a5d1eb0-0378-11f0-a7db-e5eee6e4215c"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; as the tombstone of women's erotic lives is a fallacy,' she detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's why you're reading a lot now, as social norms have expanded, that older women are dating younger men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And why are they dating younger men? Because their sexual capacity after menopause grows and older men sometimes can't keep up with us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So the perfect erotic match often can be the older woman and the younger man. He has the capacity to keep up with her ever-growing eroticism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued: 'Now, I'm not saying that we should just all be with older men. I'm saying that the phenomenon of older women with younger men makes erotic sense.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sex expert then broke down another reason why younger men are more enticing.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Women in menopause are not necessarily looking for the rich man, as &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/cher/index.html" id="mol-2a5d1eb1-0378-11f0-a7db-e5eee6e4215c"&gt;Cher&lt;/a&gt; said to her mother, "Mom, I am the rich man.’’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pamela runs Back to the Body which has retreats that allow women to get in touch with their sexual selves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Something about that made me change the sense of where "I am financially independent. I'm not looking for that." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The menopausal woman is looking for a man who's a companion. She's looking for a man who can meet her erotically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She's often looking for a man who wants to travel and do things with her. She's not looking for someone to support her and make babies. She's interested in sexual freedom. She's interested in exploration. She's interested in using up all that incredible erotic energy that's in her body before she takes it in her box. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And what's true is that women's 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s are looking pretty hot, and they're feeling pretty hot.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 14:27:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQc202c1dTOTdHOUMyeFdndDZHSzEtY1prb3VtYWsteHhGUFZLSVB3Wm1ud2dZN3J5UHp0S01VZmhYenIxZDEtV3VTWVgtcm5FYlZ1aFV4dHVHTHpIemQwUXdVeTVZNlJHMlBPX2JEX3VwU01tUnpXc1ZiWnoxeWJUYU1rdmFRNXAzbkFUMmY2dGUyZzFNWWFkUGN3azHSAaIBQVVfeXFMUEtVZ2dyQXZUR2hSRjRiRHBoMklDaThoUTFiNUxOTU00RWtrenlnN3ZTcXZhdmJ0UUVBX05wODNmUlBvc29OY1NFVTM3X0FEVnFxajA3dFJhV1p2U0pnU2YwaDlkVEh5dVNMc0x3OEJxMnNGTE44dUJITVVUMUFQOFluTU14S2FyeTA1UnRoYmc3SkRSMnNvLWdkUmxvcWREMG53</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr., Measles: When does vitamin A help?

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbm6s003phvm08dj07lyd@published"&gt;Measles is back. After the disease was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;declared eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in the United States in 2000, it was easy to feel like it was gone for good. But “eliminated” means there was no ongoing local spread. It’s not the same as “eradicated.” With &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;a few dozen cases&lt;/a&gt; popping up here and there each year, as soon as vaccination rates dip, the illness rears can rear its ugly head once more—just as it is right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbpsb000o3b73rgnpxow5@published"&gt;People have &lt;a href="https://gidmk.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-vaccines"&gt;mostly forgotten&lt;/a&gt; how bad measles can be. In a world where vaccination rates are typically above 95 percent, it’s incredibly rare to see even a single hospitalization for the condition. But, now, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/health/measles-outbreak-map.html"&gt;as outbreaks spread&lt;/a&gt;, parents across the country are desperately looking for a way to protect their children from an infection with a fatality rate of around 1 in 1,000. That might sound low, but compare it to COVID-19 in 2020 in children age 5: It’s around 100 times more deadly. And for kids who survive measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;there can be other nasty complications&lt;/a&gt;. For example, there is evidence that for some kids measles &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aay6485"&gt;permanently damages the immune system&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them more vulnerable to other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbptp000p3b73bou8d6a2@published"&gt;The obvious way to protect your family is simple: vaccination. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is one of the safest medical interventions we have and provides extremely good protection against the disease. But Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new head of the Department of Health and Human Services, &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/05/health/measles-rfk-vitamin-a-misinformation/index.html"&gt;has suggested&lt;/a&gt; that vitamin A supplements are just as useful as vaccines. “Studies have found that vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles mortality,” he &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;wrote in an op-ed for Fox News&lt;/a&gt;. “Good nutrition remains a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbpv9000q3b73i9j8yeuv@published"&gt;Unfortunately, the idea that good nutrition is a “best defense” simply isn’t true. You can eat a remarkably healthy diet and still become very ill. Vitamin A supplements do have some benefits—but they won’t protect your children from measles.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbpwy000r3b73j074vois@published"&gt;First, there is a &lt;em&gt;grain&lt;/em&gt; of truth to the idea that vitamin A can be a useful tool when it comes to measles. The vitamin is a molecule that your body uses for a wide range of purposes. One of the main things that it does is help you mount an effective immune defense. We have &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/41782/WHO_MONO_57_(part3).pdf"&gt;known for decades&lt;/a&gt; that people with very low vitamin A levels are at much higher risk of suffering and dying from many infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbpyp000s3b73adn7w1yu@published"&gt;To put it simply (in fact, perhaps too simply!): Vitamin A &lt;em&gt;deficiency&lt;/em&gt; causes you to be &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; vulnerable to infectious disease, including measles. Correcting that deficiency solves this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq09000t3b73b9u039lf@published"&gt;There are a number of studies from the ’80s and ’90s to back up this idea. &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199007193230304"&gt;A famous study&lt;/a&gt; found that a vitamin A supplement for children who were admitted to the hospital with measles reduced the risk of those kids dying by nearly 80 percent. &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008524.pub3/full"&gt;A 2017 review&lt;/a&gt; that aggregated a range of trials together did not show a benefit for mortality, but did find that the vitamin reduced the risk of children having a diagnosed case of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq1q000u3b73w17mqpe9@published"&gt;These studies are why vitamin A supplementation is still recommended as a treatment for children who are hospitalized with measles. But the problem is that they don’t really have all that much relevance to children in the United States today. The famous study I mentioned above was conducted in 1987 in Cape Town in a mostly Black population at a time when the apartheid regime still held sway. The studies aggregated together in the 2017 review were mostly conducted in China, India, and Africa in the ’80s.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq34000v3b73rwrxsowx@published"&gt;In most of these settings, vitamin A deficiency was not just common—it was ubiquitous. Some of these countries had deficiency rates above 20 percent. Meanwhile, the most recent and robust data we’ve got, &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(23)06551-6/pdf"&gt;from the ’90s&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that fewer than 1 in 100 children in the U.S. have a vitamin A deficiency. Some &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297552"&gt;even more recent data&lt;/a&gt; puts the rates even lower, although that study was mostly looking at pregnant women. This is perhaps not surprising in a world where you can get enough vitamin A dining exclusively on the McDonald’s menu.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq4m000w3b739refw3pi@published"&gt;We also know that vitamin A supplements are unlikely to help kids who have enough vitamin A. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM199010043231401"&gt;a massive 1990 study&lt;/a&gt; conducted in India showed that vitamin A supplements reduced the risk of kids dying from measles and other infectious diseases by more than half. However, all of this benefit was in children who showed very obvious signs of malnourishment, like stunted growth or skin clinging to their bones. Those kids had an 89 percent reduction in their risk of death.  Children who were not malnourished had no reduction in risk at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq61000x3b732xjxjuhr@published"&gt;Also, things are actually little more complicated than “If you have a vitamin A deficiency, a supplement can protect against measles.” One of the largest trials ever conducted—in over 1 million children—&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673612621254?via%3Dihub#abs1"&gt;took place in northern India&lt;/a&gt; in the ’00s and calls that straightforward idea into question. In this region, vitamin A deficiency was very common. The study randomly allocated kids to either get a very high-dose vitamin A supplement or a placebo medication once every six months. At the end of the trial, death rates from measles and a variety of other diseases were the same, although the rate of vitamin A deficiency had dropped drastically in the supplement group. There was also no difference in the rate of diagnosed measles between vitamin A and a placebo in this massive trial.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq7f000y3b73kswqh9xi@published"&gt;This seems to conflict with the evidence from the ’80s and ’90s that was summarized in the 2017 review I discussed above, but if you look closer, it makes sense. While vitamin A deficiency was still quite common in India in the ’00s—the study found rates of 10–15 percent without supplementation—the situation was still much better than it was two decades earlier. (&lt;a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/72/4/330.abstract?casa_token=6UIl_iLFC94AAAAA:DcPRkDIpBdQhoafNY8FrndWv5x7RqT-tx71w7dE2iJaufNf1lDy-b6akTqP3wGB1tI7kS_mu_6M"&gt;For example, a study in 1993&lt;/a&gt; showed that rates of eye disease caused by vitamin A deficiency were 22 percent in Uttar Pradesh, where this large randomized trial was later conducted.) The point is that the more modern evidence does not seem to show as much benefit for vitamin A supplementation for measles (though there are benefits for other things). This could be because the rate of severe malnutrition has dropped globally since the first of these studies were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq8x000z3b732btlrmcb@published"&gt;It’s also worth noting that none of these studies have tested the sort of supplement that you can buy in a supermarket or pharmacy. Most store-bought vitamin A supplements have somewhere between 300 and 1,500 micrograms of the substance in them. The average amount used in these studies—which, remember, are of kids with severe deficiency—is about 30,000 micrograms. That’s between 20 and 100 times higher than your average multivitamin.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbqab00103b73gg0nkvbz@published"&gt;If you live in an area with severe malnutrition, where kids are literally starving on the streets, then a vitamin A supplement is probably a good way to reduce your child’s risk of extremely nasty disease. But if you live in the U.S., where fewer than 1 in 100 kids have low vitamin A levels and even fewer have a true deficiency, the supplements probably aren’t going to do very much.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbqcb00113b733jnnny3w@published"&gt;Yes, your immune system can function better when you are not malnourished, but the best way to protect against measles is vaccination. Really, it’s not even an either/or proposition—feed your kids &lt;em&gt;and also&lt;/em&gt; get them vaccinated. We got rid of the disease for 25 years. There’s no need to bring it &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/tag/frozen-foods/" target="_blank"&gt;Frozen foods&lt;/a&gt; are a quick and cheap way to grab a meal. You can't beat the convenience and easiness of heating up your favorite pre-made dish, especially when you're in a time crunch. While frozen meals have come a long way since TV dinners that contained worrisome ingredients, many now offer some nutritional value and have a balanced portion of protein, vegetables and carbs. But that doesn't mean they're all good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of frozen meals are ultra-processed and filled with high sodium, sugar, additives and calories. Studies like this &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;i&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/i&gt; in 2024 show that serious health risks like cancer, cardiovascular health and more are linked to ultra-processed foods, so eating them sparingly or avoiding them is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;When choosing a frozen meal, here are key things to watch for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calories:&lt;/strong&gt; Depending on age range and fitness goals, on average, the guidelines for calorie intake range between 1,600 to 2,000, per &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-many-calories-a-day-should-i-eat#:~:text=Calories%20per%20day%20for%20men%20and%20people,moderately%20active%202%2C600%2066%E2%80%9375%20Calories:%20sedentary%202%2C000" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturated fat:&lt;/strong&gt; Saturated fat is something you'll often find in frozen meals. According to the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats#:~:text=AHA%20Recommendation,of%20saturated%20fat%20per%20day" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, if you're following a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, you should not have more than 13 grams of saturated fat. Too much can lead to serious health issues like high cholesterol and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sodium:&lt;/strong&gt; Some frozen meals contain a lot of salt for flavor. While it might be tasty, you're risking your heart. The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; says too many Americans consume more salt than recommended. The organization suggests having no more than 2,300 milligrams a day, but many people have 3,500mg daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugar:&lt;/strong&gt; Many frozen meals are loaded with added sugars. When consumed often, too much sugar can lead to weight gain and other major health concerns. According to the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/added-sugars" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, women shouldn't have more than 6 teaspoons of sugar a day, which is around 100 calories, and for men, no more than 9 teaspoons or 150 calories per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marie Callender's Chicken Pot Pie makes our list of healthiest frozen meals and with this one you really have to watch the portion size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://amandasauceda.com" target="_blank"&gt;Amanda Sauceda&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD  says, "&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.mariecallendersmeals.com/frozen-pot-pies/pot-pies/chicken-pot-pie-0" target="_blank"&gt;Marie Callender's Chicken Pot Pie&lt;/a&gt;, while tasty, is one to be wary of because it will get you close to maxing out your sodium for the day and is high in fat, especially saturated fat."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She adds, "What can be deceiving is that a single pot pie is actually two servings so people may not realize that the food label isn't for the whole pie.  I also don't love that the protein isn't very high but the carbs are so it may not as be as filling as you would think."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://www.foodsense.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Danielle VenHuizen&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, owner of Food Sense Nutrition agrees this meal isn't a good healthy option and says, while the "chicken pot pie is a classic comfort food, but skip Marie Callender's pie next time you are in the freezer aisle. Coming in at a whopping 55g of fat, 23g of which are artery-clogging saturated fat, this pie is everything the cardiologists say to avoid. Additionally there's almost no gut-friendly fiber and it's very high in refined carbohydrates, which can really take a hit on your blood sugar and digestion. Put this one back on the shelf."&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before taking up precious freezer space make sure your frozen meal is worthy by reading the back labels. Be wary of pre-made food with too many ingredients like the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.banquet.com/pot-pies/beef-pot-pie" target="_blank"&gt;Banquet Beef Pot Pie&lt;/a&gt; that has over 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nothing says nostalgia like a beef pot pie fresh from the oven—but if your version comes from the frozen aisle, it might be more of a processed shortcut than a home-cooked meal," says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christine Lauer, a nutritionist at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://joinmochi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Mochi Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She explains, "Banquet Beef Pot Pie contains over thirty ingredients, including hydrogenated lard, MSG, and caramel color—additives that help with texture and shelf life but do not add much in terms of nutrition. While it does provide beef, potatoes, and vegetables, it also comes with preservatives, emulsifiers, and sodium boosters, which may be worth considering if you are watching your intake of processed ingredients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this meal isn't the healthiest, Lauer suggests to look for frozen dinners "with shorter ingredient lists and whole food-based ingredients can be a great way to balance ease and nutrition. Or, for a more homemade take, a whole grain crust, lean protein, and fresh vegetables can bring all the comfort of pot pie with fewer processed additions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Dean Pancakes &amp;amp; Sausage on a Stick is a tasty sweet and savory combination that's quick and fun to eat for breakfast, but it's one of the unhealthiest you could have to start your day, according to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.nutritionbybess.com" target="_blank"&gt;Bess Berger&lt;/a&gt;, RDN is the founder of Nutrition by Bess in NJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.jimmydean.com/products/pancakes-and-sausage/on-a-stick/original-pancakes-and-sausage-on-a-stick/" target="_blank"&gt;Jimmy Dean Pancakes &amp;amp; Sausage on a Stick &lt;/a&gt;is an unhealthy mess on a stick," she says. "Per stick it doesn't seem so unhealthy but most have about 3-4 sticks per sitting. For three sticks, that calculates the macros to about 750 calories, 66 carbs, 45 g of fat, and 1230 mg of sodium."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berger adds, "This breakfast option is high in fat and sugar, with added ingredients like caramel color and soy protein concentrate, making it less nutritious."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grabbing a box of frozen fried chicken doesn't sound too bad. In fact, it sounds great with the right sides, but according to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://blog.warmbody-coldmind.com/jacek-szymanowski/" target="_blank"&gt;Jacek Szymanowski,&lt;/a&gt; PN Certified Nutritionist and Health Coach it's not only unhealthy, but it could make you sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Frozen fried chicken may be contaminated with harmful bacteria," he says. "Freezing the fried chicken doesn't kill bacteria. The chicken may be contaminated during packaging, processing, or storage before it is frozen."&lt;/p&gt;

For just a 1/6 of a pizza, it contains 380 calories, 36 g of carbs, 18 grams of fat, and 840 mg of sodium. If you have 1/2 pie, it's 1040 calories, per serving (1/6 pizza), 108 grams of carbs, 54 grams of fat, and 2580 mg of sodium. That sodium contact is more than the daily recommended amount. High in calories, fat, and sodium, which can contribute to obesity and heart disease."&lt;/p&gt;

Mac &amp;amp; cheese is one of the tastiest dishes, but this one is full of unhealthy fats, salt and will leave you hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Szymanowsk  says, "This meal is literally a calorie bomb with no significant nutritional value. The combination of a heavy cheese sauce, refined pasta, and processed bacon makes it high in unhealthy fats, calories, and sodium.&lt;/p&gt;

And what does that look like? It is back to sort of rationing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“When we started ARVs [antiretroviral drugs] way back in 2000,” Bekker recalls, “you would go, ‘you get treatment; you don’t, you don’t, you don’t’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It feels terrible … but you have to get over that.

PE is a medical emergency and needs to be treated immediately to avert death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ten hours into her flight from Toronto to Dubai, Emily Jansson got up from her window seat to use the lavatory. While waiting in line, she coughed weakly twice before collapsing, suffering a pulmonary embolism—life-threatening blood clots in her lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Jansson, who revealed her case on TikTok, was shocked by the incident, saying she had the 'heart of an athlete' because she regularly did long bike rides and cardio-intense workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not common to suffer a pulmonary embolism on a flight, with the complication affecting around one in 40,000 passengers on long-haul flights that exceed 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 900,000 people are diagnosed with PE in the US every year, with about 10 to 30 percent of patients dying within a month of diagnosis, according to the American Lung Association. It is ranked as the third-leading cause of cardiovascular death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, the condition is caused by a blood clot from the legs, called a deep vein thrombosis, traveling to the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Jansson also revealed that she was wearing compression socks, which Dr Bhatt said were not recommended for healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: &lt;span&gt;'There's no evidence that in the context of people that are otherwise healthy that wearing these things on flights reduces blood clots, which is why I don’t generally recommend them for people.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But for people who have had certain blood clots that damage the veins 'we might recommend the socks to prevent swelling in the leg'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'At the minimum, in the seat, keep your legs moving and flex your ankles.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor also said it was important to stay hydrated on flights, which can also reduce the risk of clots forming by preventing blood from thickening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Emily Jansson, who landed on her face when she passed out, was also using hormonal birth control, which raises the production of certain clotting factors in the liver while reducing the production of proteins that help prevent excessive clotting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'In addition to getting up every couple of hours, it's important to stay well hydrated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It reduces the risk of blood clots forming in the vein, especially in the legs, which can break off and go to the lungs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Deepak Bhatt, a top cardiologist at Mount Sinai, told DailyMail.com that getting up from one's cramped airplane seat and walking up and down the aisles for a few minutes can prevent potentially fatal blood clots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also warned against drinking alcohol on flights, saying this was a diuretic and would prompt the body to lose water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even just a single drink, it’s not the end of the world, but it doesn't help the cause. You definitely do not want to drink alcohol for a variety of reasons,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And no one needs another drunk person on a flight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Jansson, who had been traveling with her husband, said she had not moved on the flight for ten hours because it was very busy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘People are sleeping or eating. On top of that, they don’t really encourage you to get up and walk on flights and then there’s often turbulence so you have to be seated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Still, I wish I had gotten up to move around much more.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Staying seated for extended periods can increase the risk of blood clots that travel from the legs to the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sitting in a cramped airline seat restricts blood flow to the legs and back to the heart while the muscles in the legs that normally pump blood back to the heart are inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sitting in a cramped airline seat restricts blood flow to the legs while the muscles in the legs that normally pump blood back to the heart are inactive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Jansson's history of having a minor procedure to reduce varicose veins in her legs may have contributed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was also taking hormonal birth control, which increases the production of certain clotting factors in the liver while decreasing the production of anticoagulant proteins, which normally help prevent excessive clotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 30 percent of people who experience PE do so a second time or more. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Jansson will undergo additional blood tests to ensure she won’t experience another clot. The risk is highest within six months of experiencing the first one. She is also taking blood thinners to prevent her blood from clotting again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the residual trauma of reaching the cusp of death continues to give her anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘I was petrified flying home but it helped having my husband with me. I was afraid to go to the bathroom and lock the door so I had him stand guard outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have some stuff to work through for sure.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PE is relatively common, affecting roughly 900,000 and ranking as the third-leading cause of cardiovascular death. The top two are coronary artery disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 100,000 people who experience PE die, and doctors told Ms Jansson that she survived a ‘catastrophic event.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I felt so grateful to be alive,’ Ms Jansson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:03:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>The 2,000-calorie-a-day diet that helps you shed body fat - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5CZUlWb2ZJNEZ1dFk1MHZyYzk1bkdZLTdLZVF0M1F1OVNPbnFMWTlkR0llYV9tR1AwSHF2eGczLVRUTmx4QVBnYXdhTy10VVBhYVFQN3hZU0ZqQ2ljNmZrbGF3ZmR4M3F3eks5REhVWlFybnFTZHVfclkxVmZUdHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The health benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. Weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volunteers who followed the NiMe diet lost 1.4 per cent of their body weight over three weeks, according to the results published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. For example, this would mean the typical man in the UK losing 2.5lb and the average woman losing 2.2lb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weight loss was despite participants eating the same number of calories as they usually would (around 2,500 calories for men and 2,000 for women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A potential explanation would be that calories from whole plant foods are not as easily accessible by our digestive enzymes,” Prof Walter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Improved heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood tests revealed that levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, also known as “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/reduce-cholesterol-without-statins/"&gt;bad cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;” because it builds up in the arteries and raises the risk of heart attacks and stroke, decreased by 17 per cent after three weeks on the NiMe diet, results showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also a 14 per cent reduction in C-reactive protein – a marker for inflammation and heart disease, Prof Walter noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;3. Lowered Type 2 diabetes risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood sugar decreased by 6 per cent among those following the NiMe diet, Prof Walter said. Blood tests also revealed an increase in indole-3-propionic acid – a metabolite that has been shown to protect against Type 2 diabetes and nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;4. Enhanced gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On a Western diet low in dietary fibre, the gut microbiome degrades the mucus layer in the gut, which leads to inflammation,” Prof Walter explains. In contrast, the high-fibre NiMe diet helps to maintain this barrier which, in turn, reduces inflammation, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study found that those following the NiMe diet had an increase in short-chain fatty acids in the gut, which help with digestion and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;5. Lower cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low-fibre diet can force gut microbes to ferment (break down) protein because there is not enough fibre for them to ferment. “This generates harmful by-products that likely contribute to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/colon-cancer/"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;,” Prof Walter explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the study found that the NiMe diet increased carbohydrate fermentation in the gut, at the expense of protein fermentation, which reduced levels of metabolites linked to cancer, such as secondary bile acids and 8-hydroxyguanine, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the NiMe diet is very high in fibre, it can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, similar to other dishes high in onions or beans, such as bloating and gas, Prof Walter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These symptoms vary among individuals,” he notes. “The diet might therefore not be the right choice for individuals that are intolerant to fibre.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to incorporate the NiMe diet into your life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I follow the diet and I stick to it as much as I can,” says Prof Walter. He does the food shop for his household and sticks to buying ingredients that fit within the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He found it difficult to stop eating, for the most part, cheese and processed meats, though he found it easy to give up ultra-processed foods. “But I still struggle with being too busy, so at lunch time, I still often have a sandwich, which would not be NiMe,” Prof Walter notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Who should follow the diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data shows that the NiMe diet reduces risk indicators of important chronic diseases, including &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/body-type-2-diabetes-symptoms-risk/"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease and cancer,” Prof Walters says. “So everyone who wants to stay healthy should benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A longer lifespean and more years spent in good health have been linked to healthy dietary patterns that are in line with the NiMe approach, he notes. Prof Walters plans to study whether the diet could also have this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Recipes &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/54f2849f-fb67-4374-ad00-83f8787b0e2c" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NiMe Diet: Scientific Principles and Recipes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Yellow pea soup&lt;/h2&gt;

[+]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; new diabetes treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a venture investor in healthcare, I am privileged to witness the remarkable advances being made in the treatment and management of diabetes, a condition that affects over 537 million people globally. The prevalence of type 1 diabetes is expected to increase from 8.4 million to between 15 and 17 million by 2040. The urgency to find effective treatments and potential cures has never been greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetes, whether type 1 or type 2, is characterized by a reduction in functional, insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. This loss is a common thread that links both forms of diabetes, suggesting that strategies aimed at replenishing beta cells hold therapeutic promise. Traditional approaches, such as whole pancreas transplantation and pancreatic islet transplantation, have shown efficacy but are limited by high costs, the scarcity of donor organs, and the invasive nature of the procedures. It’s therefore imperative to also develop scalable, cost-effective solutions that can reach the millions affected by this chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Quest For a Simple Pill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over 15 years, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have been at the forefront of diabetes research, striving to identify a drug capable of inducing the regeneration of human beta cells. In a significant breakthrough in 2015, they discovered harmine, a small molecule that is capable of stimulating beta cell replication. Esra Karakose, assistant professor in the Department of Medicine, is now studying the mechanism of action, and her team’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00603-7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00603-7" aria-label="publication"&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt; from an in vitro study suggests that harmine is inducing “fate conversion,” where alpha cells—another type of pancreatic cell—transform into beta-like cells capable of producing insulin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revelation opens new avenues for treatment, as alpha cells are abundant in individuals with diabetes. By harnessing this potential, we may be able to address the underlying issue of beta cell loss in type 1 and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, another group of researchers, including Andrew Stewart and Peng Wang, published another recent &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adg3456" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adg3456" aria-label="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in which they gave harmine alone or in combo with a GLP 1, to mice transplanted with human pancreatic islet cells. Harmine increased the human beta cell mass by 300% with harmine alone, and by 700% in combination with a GLP 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question was: how could we see such a dramatic increase in beta cell mass if the proliferation of beta cells was small?” Karakose said. “Now with my research, we believe that alpha to beta cell conversion was playing a role.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karakose is currently planning further experiments using advanced single-cell sequencing techniques to better understand the molecular pathways involved in this regeneration process, hoping to confirm her findings in human islet cells transplanted into mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are also clinical studies ongoing with harmine, and new studies are planned. It will certainly be interesting to follow whether the GLP-1s in combination with harmine truly do show a synergy in future human trials. If so, the dream of a simple, inexpensive pill that could serve as a solution for millions of people may not be so far out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potentially Groundbreaking Cell Therapy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Sana Biotechnology is pioneering a revolutionary approach to islet cell transplantation for type 1 diabetes that circumvents the need for immunosuppression. Their innovative hypoimmune technology enables the transplantation of engineered islet cells without triggering an immune response. This &lt;a href="https://ir.sana.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sana-biotechnology-announces-positive-clinical-results-type-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://ir.sana.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sana-biotechnology-announces-positive-clinical-results-type-1" aria-label="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; represents the first instance of a successful donor-derived islet cell transplantation in a fully immune-competent individual without the need for immunosuppressive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This person is now making his own insulin for the first time in 30 years,” said Steve Harr, the President and CEO of Sana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, the rejection of transplanted cells has posed a significant challenge in transplant medicine, necessitating lifelong immunosuppression for recipients. Sana's approach, which includes gene modifications to create cells that evade both allogeneic and autoimmune detection, could fundamentally change the landscape of diabetes treatment. The implications of this research are profound, as it may pave the way for one-time treatments that restore insulin production in patients without the complications associated with immunosuppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to make this at a scale that can transform this disease globally,” Harr said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the recently announced study, the transplanted cells came from a cadaver, after which they were engineered to evade immune rejection. The next step in the program, says Harr, is to move away from cadaver-sourced cells, which provided a proof of concept, and instead use genetically modified pluripotent stem cells. Those could be grown into pancreatic cells suitable for transplant. There’s a virtually unlimited supply of stem cells that could be scaled up for such a commercial effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A cure for type 1 diabetes is now inevitable,” Harr says. “All the component parts have happened. The only things patients have to worry about are time, capital, safety, and scale. We really hope Sana gets to push all those forward, but whether we do or not, I’m confident someone will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of others, on my trip to Bayer’s CoLab in Shanghai last year, I met with immunologist and stem cell researcher HongKui Deng of Peking University. He and his colleagues had just published an article in “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39326417/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39326417/" aria-label="Cell"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;” about a unique cell therapy approach for diabetes. While most such therapies have used cadaveric cells or cells derived from donors, Professor Deng is the first to demonstrate that it is possible to use the patient’s own cells in the treatment of diabetes. In the recently published study, his team chemically reprogrammed a 25-year-old patient’s cells into islet cells. Within two weeks after the transplant, the patient’s required daily dose of insulin began to decrease, and the patient “achieved complete insulin independence on day 75.” At the one-year follow-up mark, the patient still did not need insulin and had no transplant abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to following the various cell therapy approaches in development as they advance to the next clinical stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Artificial Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond pharmacological advancements, we are also witnessing a technological revolution in diabetes management through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). A new &lt;a href="https://med.virginia.edu/diabetes-technology/2025/02/05/new-uva-clinical-trial-explores-ai-powered-insulin-delivery-for-better-diabetes-care/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://med.virginia.edu/diabetes-technology/2025/02/05/new-uva-clinical-trial-explores-ai-powered-insulin-delivery-for-better-diabetes-care/" aria-label="clinical trial"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Virginia aims to assess an AI-powered insulin delivery system that utilizes reinforcement learning to improve automated insulin delivery. This system, known as the Bolus Priming System with Reinforcement Learning (BPS_RL), represents a significant leap forward in diabetes management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current automated insulin delivery systems require user input to adjust insulin doses, a process fraught with potential errors, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children and young adults. The updated software system seeks to close this loop, automating the dosing process based on glucose history and meal detection. By eliminating the need for user intervention, this technology promises to enhance blood sugar control, particularly during meals and overnight, thereby improving the quality of life for individuals living with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study will compare how well blood sugar levels are maintained in 16 diabetic adults with and without the AI-powered upgrade. If approved, this AI-powered system could be integrated into existing diabetes management systems, providing a seamless upgrade for hundreds of thousands of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Living with Type 1 diabetes is a full-time job,” said Heman Shakeri, assistant professor of data science at the University of Virginia, who is helping to develop the new AI system. “Kids will benefit the most. That’s why I get up early in morning, because the improvement can be so enormous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The convergence of these groundbreaking research efforts and technological innovations marks a pivotal moment in the fight against diabetes. And this is only a glimpse into what may be coming down the pike. In Leaps’ portfolio, for example, we have invested in Mozart Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotech company testing a bispecific autoimmune checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of early stage and slowly progressing autoimmune disease, like type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision of a world where diabetes is no longer a life-altering condition is becoming increasingly attainable. I am optimistic that the efforts of researchers, healthcare professionals, and technology innovators are paving the way for a future where diabetes management is more effective, accessible, and ultimately, curative.&lt;/p&gt;

Officials &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; the virus’s spread could persist into the spring and summer travel seasons, allowing the virus to reach other parts of the country; more cases and deaths could follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The outbreak has now exceeded the total number of reported measles cases in the US &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, which itself had already represented an increase from 2023. Measles vaccination rates in most US states &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/"&gt;have fallen&lt;/a&gt; below the 95 percent threshold scientists consider necessary to control the disease, and those rates have continued to drop. The Texas emergency appears to have &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;begun in an insular religious community&lt;/a&gt; with high vaccination exemption rates; &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-gaines-county-texas-religious-exemptions-cacdae1843fa918964a1b8e01fe757f5"&gt;14 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all children in Gaines County have exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The nation’s health leadership, meanwhile, is undermining the best defense against measles. While US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;paid lip service&lt;/a&gt; to the value of vaccines, he has also &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctors-push-back-parents-embrace-kennedy-vitamin-texas-measles-outbreak-2025-03-08/"&gt;pitched alternative treatments&lt;/a&gt; unsupported by medical science. He’s also launching new government &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/cdc-research-debunked-link-vaccines-autism-rcna195499"&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt; into the long-debunked theory linking autism and vaccines — investigations seem designed to erode public trust in the measles shot’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; at the very moment it is most needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What’s happening right now could only be the beginning. The more the US strays from the public health playbook that helped the country to reach &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#:~:text=Historic%20achievement,control%20in%20the%20Americas%20region."&gt;official measles elimination in 2000&lt;/a&gt;, the more outbreaks will likely occur — and the bigger they’ll be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We may be entering a new era when this once-dormant virus is again an active threat to people’s health. Here’s what you can do to protect yourself and your family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="you-really-really-dont-want-to-get-measles" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;You really, really don’t want to get measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Most Americans have been lucky enough to live in a world without measles, a disease that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/index.html#:~:text=107%2C500%20lives%20lost%20to%20measles%20worldwide%20in%202023%2C%20mostly%20children."&gt;globally still kills over 100,000 people&lt;/a&gt;, most of them young children. Its risks, therefore, have become largely hypothetical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But for the unvaccinated, those risks are real. Measles is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7188204/#:~:text=Severe%20cases%20of%20measles%20require,1000%20cases%20results%20in%20death."&gt;a formidable and extremely contagious virus&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;dangerous&lt;/a&gt; during the initial infection, which can lead to high fever and the signature measles rash, while some patients will go on to develop pneumonia or encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, both of which can be deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Measles has a fatality rate of 0.1 percent, but an estimated 20 percent of cases require hospitalization. The disease is particularly threatening to kids, especially young infants, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/health/measles-newborn-pregnancy-risks/index.html"&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt; and people who are immunocompromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some vaccine skeptics, including RFK Jr., &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/rfk-jr-it-would-be-better-if-everybody-got-measles/"&gt;downplay&lt;/a&gt; the risk of measles. “It used to be, when I was a kid, that everybody got measles. And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection,” he said recently on Fox News. But measles was and is not some harmless disease: &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;Between 400 to 500 children&lt;/a&gt; died annually from measles in the US in the decade before a vaccine was introduced in 1963. From 1968 to 2016, there were about 550 measles deaths &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; in the US, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Until the recent deaths in the Texas outbreak, it had been &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-death-family/681985/"&gt;10 years&lt;/a&gt; since a single measles death had been recorded in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even those who do survive a measles infection can face long-term health consequences, particularly for those in high-risk groups. Some of those infected in the current outbreak may be dealing with the fallout for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Measles can cause what’s known as &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay6485"&gt;immunity amnesia&lt;/a&gt;. The virus can wipe out more than half a person’s preexisting antibodies that protect them against other pathogens, which can leave them more vulnerable to other diseases for years after their infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In rare cases, measles can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-immune-system-brain-swelling-long-term-rcna195918"&gt;fatal brain swelling&lt;/a&gt; years after the initial infection. Patients can also suffer &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/measles-infection-symptoms-longterm-risks-rcna138583"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt; from ear infections experienced during their illness, while those who develop acute &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;encephalitis&lt;/a&gt; can suffer permanent neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-you-can-do-to-protect-yourself-from-measles" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What you can do to protect yourself from measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Vaccination remains the best defense against measles: Two doses of the MMR vaccine — given to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella — is 97 percent effective at preventing a measles infection (and therefore spread). It is perhaps the most effective vaccine we have for any disease, and any risks from the vaccine are &lt;a href="https://x.com/PeterHotez/status/1899778505627385877"&gt;astonishingly low compared to the dangers of measles itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In this new world where you’re more likely to see a measles outbreak in your community, people should consider taking steps to protect their health or that of their loved ones. Here’s what you can do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Parents, if you have young children—the group most at risk from measles — talk to your pediatrician about vaccination. The usual schedule is one shot around age 1 and another shot around age 5, but there is some flexibility. The CDC already &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; that infants as young as 6 months can receive one dose if they are traveling internationally, and the recommended age for the second dose ranges from 4 to 6 years old. Several leading public health experts, including former CDC director Rochelle Walensky, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2831828?guestAccessKey=11aca00c-eba0-4515-a778-8658b1948f2e&amp;amp;cmp=1&amp;amp;utm_campaign=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8xNq-9YbIRf2vyGLZcTMVt0EC9kKiRgoZMecFTxqempP2dp4rrCwYJeVQLEgmatVbs4go0RyQUQl9Dx4BOdiZ1E8c1Ag&amp;amp;_hsmi=352150593&amp;amp;utm_content=media_advisory&amp;amp;utm_source=silverchair"&gt;wrote in a recent &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; op-ed&lt;/a&gt; that the recommendations should be updated to advise one shot for infants traveling in the US to areas with higher risk of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Reports of vaccinated people getting sick in Texas have at the same time raised questions about &lt;a href="/health/402025/texas-measles-outbreak-cases-mmr-vaccination"&gt;how protected vaccinated people actually are&lt;/a&gt;. As good as it is, 97 percent effectiveness isn’t 100 percent, and it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to be vaccinated and still get sick. For a small percentage of people, the vaccine simply doesn’t produce immunity. It is also possible that immunity could wane over time, but that was previously not an issue because high vaccination rates had snuffed out the virus’s spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In part because there &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/04/measles-vaccine-shortage-rfk/"&gt;may not be a lot of excess vaccine supply&lt;/a&gt;, the priority should be vaccinating those people who do not have any protection at all: those very young children and the people who weren’t vaccinated as kids. Pregnant women &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-pregnancy/moms-to-be/index.html"&gt;should not&lt;/a&gt; receive the vaccine, but women planning to become pregnant could talk to their doctor about a booster shot; likewise, people with immune conditions &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html"&gt;should talk with their doctor&lt;/a&gt; before getting an additional dose, as the vaccine’s live virus could present a risk depending on their level of immunodeficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Those in high-risk groups may want to take additional precautions, such as wearing masks, if there are reports of measles infections in their immediate area. (That doesn’t just mean the areas of the current outbreak — isolated infections have also been found in &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/la-county-confirms-first-measles-case-in-resident/?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_JrjkkkwQ9HjE95xaA9UB_rUsQjHTPv92TUFbSs6WgBLpIm-9tzeuHX42c-Ap25t5zZqycHTxXPY6xj2V9ZsPtGytFxg&amp;amp;_hsmi=351424356&amp;amp;utm_content=351424356&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/measles-confirmed-case-maryland-howard-county/64111796"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; in people who recently traveled internationally.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For other people who have already been vaccinated but are worried about transmission, it may be reasonable to consider a booster shot. But there are some important steps you should take first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;First, check your vaccination records if you can find them. If you received two doses as a child, you very likely had a successful immune response; only three in 100 people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html"&gt;don’t&lt;/a&gt;. If you received one dose — as was generally the case before 1989 — you’re probably still good, but it is a little more likely that you never developed immunity, &lt;a href="/health/402025/texas-measles-outbreak-cases-mmr-vaccination"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; Aaron Milstone, an infectious disease pediatrician at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Either way, the next step would be to talk to your doctor. (As always, with anything regarding your health.) They can administer a “titer test” that measures the measles antibodies in your body. If they’re still present — great, you should be good. If they’re not, you may want to ask your doctor about getting an additional measles shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The risks should be kept in context: If you’re not near a confirmed measles case, your personal risk remains negligible. If you’re vaccinated and have antibodies, you are very likely protected from the virus regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But they can not be ignored either. Milstone said he and his fellow infectious disease doctors could not believe it when they heard the news in February of a child’s death from measles in the United States of America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“You hope people don’t have to die for others to take this seriously,” Milstone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOY0tiMFNacG9TcTBscDZkMVRNTlZ6dFc5TVJITDRMMmVHUEI3RFRsclF4VUE0SnJFU0VIZjR2bU12cjY4U2NDN0tvN1RWUzNjOWVQeVpYYmhnTHZndDBCdUw1ZXhfeWx6dGRjV1czTU05OE8xZ1pKaHBGTFBqbllFVXlRN3R6OTY0U2JqVGhhTQ</guid></item><item><title>Diet quality and abdominal fat in midlife are linked to brain health in older age - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPenFnSDR0Wmp6a0pHSFdVTWlVS19mWGRZQnZwR2hORG9jdnAzNjFOX0tpSlUyRDIyNzh4QjVqRGl5azNycy1oai0teWp3WFZlSmhqZVQ0U2tRS0h6bGJEanZ2S2V0TEVGNTFXbTgyMXJFX1FwNVpyV1JBdTFzbGR1cURkRFpEZ0xxVE5scjZUUy0wMmJhbGJCaXZwU09Cb1VTaGJyQm9lTzZ0Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2831324" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that maintaining a high-quality diet and managing abdominal fat during midlife may help preserve brain health and cognitive function in later years. Researchers found that individuals who followed healthier diets and had lower waist-to-hip ratios between the ages of 48 and 70 showed stronger brain connectivity and better cognitive performance as they aged. These findings highlight the potential for lifestyle changes in middle age to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unhealthy eating habits and obesity have long been linked to chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, which are also known risk factors for dementia. While prior research has examined how specific nutrients affect brain function, few studies have explored the long-term effects of overall diet quality and abdominal fat on brain connectivity and memory. The hippocampus, a brain region essential for memory, is particularly sensitive to lifestyle-related changes, but evidence regarding its connectivity with other brain areas remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study aimed to address these gaps by investigating whether diet quality and waist-to-hip ratio in midlife, as well as changes in these factors over time, were associated with brain structure, brain function, and cognitive abilities in older age. By analyzing long-term data, the researchers hoped to clarify whether lifestyle factors influence brain health during the transition from middle to late adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the context of the global obesity pandemic (with approximately 43% of adults and 20% of children worldwide classified as overweight), improving metabolic health and dietary quality during midlife is essential for brain health and cognition in later life,” explained study author &lt;a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/person/jensen/371395" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Daria E. A. Jensen&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral fellow at the University Medical Center Leipzig and the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, and visiting researcher at the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This aligns with the World Health Organization’s guidelines, which emphasise a balanced diet and effective weight management as key strategies for preventing dementia. This study aimed to address gaps in existing research by examining the long-term effects of overall diet quality and waist-to-hip ratio (as a measure for abdominal fat) on brain connectivity and cognitive function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used data from the Whitehall II Study, a long-term health study of British civil servants that began in 1985. Participants’ waist and hip measurements were taken at five different time points over 21 years, while their diet quality was assessed using a validated food questionnaire at three of those time points. The study focused on 664 participants for the waist-to-hip ratio analysis and 512 for the diet quality analysis, all of whom later underwent MRI brain scans and cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured diet quality using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010, a scoring system that reflects adherence to a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. They assessed brain connectivity using MRI scans, examining both structural integrity (using diffusion tensor imaging) and functional connections in the hippocampus (using resting-state fMRI). Cognitive function was evaluated through a series of memory, executive function, and processing speed tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that individuals who maintained a higher diet quality throughout midlife had stronger functional connectivity in the hippocampus, particularly with brain regions involved in visual processing and coordination. This suggests that better diet quality supports neural connections that are important for memory and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, participants who improved their diet quality over time showed better structural integrity in several key white matter pathways, including the corticospinal tract and superior thalamic radiation. These pathways are essential for communication between different brain regions and are often affected in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a higher waist-to-hip ratio in midlife was associated with widespread disruptions in white matter integrity, particularly in tracts connected to the hippocampus. Individuals with higher waist-to-hip ratios performed worse on memory and executive function tests in older age. The study also found that these cognitive deficits were partly mediated by changes in white matter structure, suggesting that abdominal fat may contribute to brain aging by damaging neural pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key takeaway from our study is that maintaining a high-quality diet and managing waist-to-hip ratio during midlife are crucial for supporting brain health and cognitive function in later life,” Jensen told PsyPost. “These lifestyle choices can have long-lasting impacts, potentially reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, while diet quality was linked to brain connectivity and structure, it did not directly correlate with cognitive test performance. In contrast, waist-to-hip ratio had a clear impact on cognitive abilities, likely due to its influence on white matter health. This suggests that excess abdominal fat may accelerate cognitive decline by impairing the brain’s structural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was surprising to see the strong association between waist-to-hip ratio and cognitive performance, mediated by changes in white matter connectivity,” Jensen said. “This highlights the significant impact of central obesity on brain health, which is not commonly emphasized in discussions about cognitive maintenance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, there are some limitations to consider. The participants were predominantly male and had higher education levels than the general population, which may limit the applicability of the findings to a broader audience. Additionally, diet quality was self-reported, which can introduce inaccuracies in measuring food intake. The study also did not account for other lifestyle factors such as physical activity or genetic predispositions that may influence brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While our study highlights significant associations between diet, waist-to-hip ratio, and brain health, it’s important to note that these findings are correlational and do not establish causation,” Jensen noted. “However, studies on people living with obesity showed that bariatric surgery for weight loss may lead to brain structure reorganisation at long-term follow-up (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/1/127" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Prehn et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;). With our longitudinal study design, we could show the long-term impact of body composition and diet in midlife onto brain organization and cognition later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should explore whether specific dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, have stronger effects on brain connectivity. Further studies could also investigate whether reducing abdominal fat through targeted interventions leads to measurable improvements in cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My long-term goals include exploring the mechanisms linking diet and obesity to brain health, particularly the role of the gut microbiome,” Jensen said. “I also aim to investigate specific eating behaviours and decision-making processes to refine strategies for preventing cognitive decline through lifestyle modifications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this study highlight midlife as a key period for lifestyle interventions aimed at preserving brain health. Encouraging individuals to adopt a healthier diet and manage their waist-to-hip ratio between the ages of 48 and 70 could have lasting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would like to emphasize the critical role of early lifestyle interventions in the prevention of cognitive decline,” Jensen concluded. “Our findings underscore the importance for medical doctors to advocate for healthier dietary habits and effective management of central obesity during midlife. By doing so, healthcare professionals can play a pivotal role in guiding patients towards lifestyle choices that significantly influence their cognitive health trajectory, ultimately reducing the risk of dementia and enhancing quality of life in older age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.0171" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Association of Diet and Waist-to-Hip Ratio With Brain Connectivity and Memory in Aging&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Daria E.

      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;From the moment Steve Young canceled the Milam County Junior Livestock Association show, his days as county judge were numbered.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Young didn’t realize that at the time, of course. It was March 2020, a new virus was rapidly spreading around the country, and politics was the last thing this retired lawyer-turned-cattle rancher was thinking about. He was just doing what he felt needed to be done to keep the 25,000 residents of this rural county 90 minutes northeast of Austin safe.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But the blowback was intense, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“People thought it was just wrong to cancel it, and this was a hoax and it was nothing worse than the flu,” he said in a recent interview. “This thing was highly politicized.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Many in Milam County supported Young as he closed businesses, required masks and turned vacant hospital buildings into a vaccine clinic, eventually offering families $250 to get their teens the shot. But those who opposed him were loud and virulent — he received death threats, and more than one person stormed into the office to yell at him.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Young remembers getting a call from another county official who warned him he was likely costing himself a job.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I said, ‘I understand that, but we need to do this,’” he said. “This is more important than a reelection. And if they don't like it and they want to run against me, then let them have it. In fact, if the guy wants to start tomorrow, tell him to come on.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;After two years of battling COVID-19 and the community, Young lost his seat to the former county Republican Party chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;It’s a story that played out across Texas, in small towns, big cities and all the way up to the governor’s mansion, as elected officials and public health workers became the punching bag for an angry, fearful public unused to government restrictions. Some, like Young, were chased out of public service. Others, like Gov. Greg Abbott, walked back their early support for public health mandates.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas entered the pandemic at a disadvantage, with an unhealthy and uninsured population, an underfunded public health system and workforce shortages across the health care system. While some hoped the pandemic might force improvements, five years after the first Texan died from COVID, many of these long-standing issues have worsened.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Today, Texas spends less per person on public health than it did before the pandemic. Fewer Texans are getting themselves or their kids vaccinated. Local officials have less power to protect their constituents during a health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Dozens of state and local health officials, health care workers, epidemiologists and academics say the hard-earned lessons from COVID have been drowned out by a growing distrust of science, expertise and authority.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;All of this leaves Texas less able and, likely, less willing to robustly respond to the next pandemic, at a time when measles and avian flu are spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“A large group of people in the United States think that everyone in authority, not just the government, are stupid liars, and if you’re smart, you’ll do the exact opposite of what they tell you to,” said Dr. John Hellerstedt, who led the Texas Department of State Health Services during COVID. “This sets us up for catastrophic failure in the face of the next inevitable emergency.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;Before COVID, most people were content to ignore public health, blissfully ignorant of the machine that quietly kept them and their community healthy by investigating disease outbreaks, inspecting restaurants, treating sexually transmitted diseases and vaccinating children. The fiscal conservatives at the Texas Legislature were too, typically allocating just enough funding to keep state and local public health authorities from collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In 2020, Texas spent about $20 per person on public health, 39th among the states and Washington, D.C. Local public health agencies operated with bare bones staffing, outdated technology and reduced services. The state agency that filled in the gaps was similarly strapped. Even with constant reminders that something larger was looming — the Ebola scare in 2014, the threat of Zika in 2015, periodic outbreaks of tuberculosis — there simply wasn’t the funding or the time to meaningfully prepare for a widespread crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


  
  

  





    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“You're struggling to do contact tracing on outbreaks of HIV. You’re struggling to reduce maternal mortality. You’re struggling to carry out the ordinary functions of public health,” Hellerstedt said. “It was impossible to think as a government agency you’d have the time or ability to truly model something like a global pandemic response.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In 2019, Hellerstedt came to the Texas Legislature with a prediction as ominous as it was prescient. The state’s “very, very outdated” disease tracking software was at risk of failure, he warned. Without an upgrade, it would “threaten the timeliness of public health’s infectious disease response,” the agency said in its budget request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Legislature appropriated $3.5 million to upgrade the technology. But it was too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Before the agency had a chance to implement the changes, COVID hit, and decades of underfunding public health suddenly became a very expensive choice. There weren’t enough employees to do contact tracing. There weren’t clear protocols for acquiring and dispersing personal protective equipment, or setting up testing, or reporting results. And, as Hellerstedt predicted, the state’s disease tracking software quickly became overwhelmed at the moment it was needed most.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The state scrambled to build a new system on the fly, as local agencies relied on homespun trackers to monitor mounting case counts. In Cameron County, on the Texas-Mexico border, public health administrator Esmeralda Guajardo created an Excel spreadsheet and staff went in by hand to reconcile misspellings and double surnames.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We had to piecemeal a lot of stuff because we didn't have the resources,” she said. “But we wanted to make sure that we weren’t duplicating the case counts, because, of course, that affects the trust that people have with us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As Guajardo quickly realized, these case counts were more than just numbers. For a panicked and increasingly restive public, their rise and fall represented hope and devastation. For government officials, the numbers offered cover for difficult decisions: Gov. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/greg-abbott/"&gt;Greg Abbott&lt;/a&gt; justified his stay-at-home orders as based on “data and doctors.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Every time the state corrected the counts or suddenly released a backlogged deluge of positive test results, it introduced another crack in the public’s trust and willingness to comply with the rules. The longer the restrictions went on, the more that crack widened into a chasm.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“People wanted to know that if they complied, the result would get better. They didn’t want to think we didn’t have control over this,” said Mark Owens, a political science professor at The Citadel who ran the UT Tyler/Dallas Morning News poll at the time. “Everyone wanted it to go away, and when they complied and it didn’t, they got frustrated.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Public health agencies, once behind-the-scenes workhorses, became an outlet for the public’s growing anger over business closures, nursing home restrictions, and rapidly changing guidance. In Lubbock County, health director Katherine Wells’ received death threats, requiring police to guard her house.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We’d report the numbers and people would be so angry, saying, ‘Oh you’re just fear-mongering, you’re evil, you’re trying to pick a fight,” said former Milam County public health director Robert Kirkpatrick. “No, sir, I’m just doing my job.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As the death toll rose in hard-hit Cameron County, the distrust began to bleed into everything the public health agency did. Guajardo watched as longtime employees left for less intense, better paying jobs that didn’t have to interface with an angry public, and she couldn’t blame them.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We learned so much going through the pandemic, but then so much of that institutional knowledge walked out the door,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;There was, initially, widespread support for mask-wearing, school closures and business shutdowns. But it didn’t take long for that moment of unity to crumble along partisan lines, as Texas’ elected officials joined the call to lift restrictions and reopen the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Texas, things came to a head in May 2020, when Dallas salon owner Shelley Luther was jailed for reopening her business in violation of the state’s shutdown orders. Luther, who is now a state representative, framed the ongoing restrictions as a violation of her personal liberties. U.S. Sen. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/ted-cruz/"&gt;Ted Cruz&lt;/a&gt; and Lt. Gov. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/dan-patrick/"&gt;Dan Patrick&lt;/a&gt;, as well as President Donald Trump, rallied to her cause.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We have the constitutional right to be able to work to provide for our families, to pay our mortgages and I don’t feel it’s right to close us down for this long period of time,” Luther told &lt;a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/coronavirus/dallas-salon-set-to-re-open-despite-county-state-orders/2356298/?fbclid=IwAR3HbmK3tMRasihPY09SY2qrMkeHoPTqi4dF8WCEuG_sbz5Gk_HTEDXSePs"&gt;local news outlets at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Facing pressure from the right, Abbott quickly removed the enforcement mechanism from his orders and allowed some businesses to reopen sooner than expected. He later went even further, forbidding cities, counties and school districts from implementing their own mask mandates.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;A group of local leaders, incensed by what they saw as an undermining of their public health authority, sued, but the Texas Supreme Court sided with Abbott, saying he had the authority to tell local officials what to do — and what not to do — during a public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Abbott did not respond to an interview request.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Many of these policies have since been enshrined in state law. Legislators have banned cities and counties from enacting mask mandates, closing businesses or schools, or requiring COVID vaccines, and prohibited the mandatory closure of churches and gun stores during an emergency declaration. While some of these laws apply only to COVID, public health experts say the playbook and political fault lines are in place to restrict the response to future disease outbreaks, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Legislature also reined in the amount of time the state can remain under a public health disaster or emergency authorization. These declarations, intended to allow the state government to respond more nimbly to a crisis, can now only remain in effect for 30 days, after which the Legislature or a legislative committee would have to renew it monthly.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It's just this weird, circular, extra, and I think, hindering level of bureaucracy that I am afraid is not going to be helpful for us in the next pandemic,” said Allison Winnike, a Houston-based lawyer with the Network for Public Health Law. “Our public health system will have its hands completely tied.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Some of the post-COVID legislation has been beneficial to public health, Winnike and other experts say. Legislators created a position for a state epidemiologist, strengthened data reporting requirements and funded the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute, which helps state and local leaders anticipate and prepare for the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But the state now spends less per capita on public health than it did before the pandemic, dropping down to fourth worst among states and D.C. Experts worry that the lasting distrust and disempowerment of public health will ripple through future disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I do understand that everything’s political, but public health is truly for everyone,” Winnike said. “It’s one of the basic things to have the conditions to live a healthy life and be protected from disease in your community. And I wish that was what we were bringing forward into the next pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;For years, Dr. Peter Hotez watched in horror as more and more Texas families declined to get their children vaccinated, and wondered what, if anything, would reverse this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Then came the pandemic. For a brief moment, Hotez thought this might be the turning point. And it was — just not in the way he’d hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Unfortunately, it got politicized in a way that did the opposite, and has exacerbated anti-vaccine activism in the most horrific way imaginable,” said Hotez, a vaccine expert and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Like everything with COVID, the vaccine didn’t start out so political. “Operation Warp Speed,” the effort to quickly develop a COVID vaccine, launched under the first Trump administration. In &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/12/22/greg-abbott-texas-vaccine/"&gt;December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Abbott proudly got the shot on camera, touting how “safe and easy” it was.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But as the vaccine rolled out, and employer vaccine requirements with it, some began to chafe against what they saw as an infringement on their medical freedom. Conservatives began to coalesce around opposition to the vaccine, and by the end of 2021, Texas had sued the Biden administration at least four times over vaccine mandates for &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/16/texas-sues-biden-vaccine-mandate/"&gt;health care workers, federal contractors&lt;/a&gt;, l&lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/05/texas-ken-paxton-businesses-vaccines/"&gt;arge employers&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/04/texas-national-guard-vaccine-mandate/"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Texas also barred any state funds from being used to promote the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As vaccination rates began to diverge along partisan lines, COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths did, too. By fall 2021, death rates in counties that voted for Trump were four times as high as counties that voted for Biden, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/03/03/the-changing-political-geography-of-covid-19-over-the-last-two-years/"&gt;Pew Research found&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Texas, this politicized resistance created what Hotez calls the “great COVID tragedy,” the death of more than 40,000 people after vaccines became widely available, 85% of them unvaccinated. These waves of casualties did little to change opinion — by &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/legislative/2022-Reports/Rider-33-Report-COVID-19-Immunization-Distribution-Texas.pdf"&gt;December 2022&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority of unvaccinated Texans said they were not likely to get vaccinated in the next three months, and the largest percentage said nothing would make them more comfortable with the idea of getting the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Hotez can understand why Texans were anxious about getting a newly developed vaccine, and resistant to mandates. But it didn’t stop there.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“In their zeal to push back against vaccine mandates, which you can kind of understand, they went to the next measure and falsely discredited the effectiveness and safety of vaccines,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Pushback to the COVID vaccine brought a deluge of new people into the anti-vaccine movement, moving this once-fringe political faction into the mainstream of the Republican party. After growing slowly for several years, the number of Texas families opting out of getting their children immunized spiked after 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


  
  

  





    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The consequences have been swift: Texas is currently experiencing its largest measles outbreak in 30 years, one of several vaccine-preventable conditions that’s on the rise as immunization rates drop.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“One of our hospitals has the highest number of COVID patients in the hospital right now than we’d had in probably a year,” Dr. Ron Cook, the Lubbock public health authority and a family physician, told The Texas Tribune in February. “We have the lowest uptake of flu [vaccines] and the highest flu levels. We have lower uptake of pertussis, and we have the highest level [of whooping cough] in nine years, which can be devastating, especially for little ones.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/2023-2024.html"&gt;39% of adult Texans&lt;/a&gt; got their flu shot in 2022-2023, the lowest rate since 2017. There was a slight improvement in 2023-2024, the latest data available, but Texas remains below the national average. The U.S. is experiencing its worst flu season since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Influenza can easily mutate into something much more dangerous than the seasonal flu, especially with H5N1, or avian flu, currently spreading among animals. If avian flu mutated in a way that was widely transmissible between humans — “That’s how pandemics arise,” said Catherine Troisi, an epidemiologist at UTHealth Houston School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It’s really helpful in preventing the emergence of a totally new influenza virus we haven’t seen before if people are vaccinated against seasonal flu,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;This vaccine hesitancy doesn’t just increase the odds of another pandemic, Troisi said, but also how quickly we could stop it once it's here.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Let’s say that H5N1 does become more transmissible from person to person. We probably could have a vaccine ready pretty quickly,” she said. “But would anybody take it? That’s the big question.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;When Hellerstedt looks back on Texas’ handling of an unprecedented global pandemic, he sees successes. Hospitals stayed open, staffed and largely able to keep up with increased demand. The state helped get millions of vaccines into arms. There was good communication between local, state and federal partners.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The failure, he says, was communication with the public. As guidance changed, restrictions were lifted and reinstated, and a novel vaccine was rolled out, leaders at every level of government failed to bring the public along, explaining what they knew and how they knew it and, most importantly, what they didn’t know and what might change once they figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Better communication wouldn’t have cut the number of deaths in half, he said. “But we would still have the confidence of the American people in the only institutions that have the authority and the capability and the capacity to shepherd them through an emergency,” he said. “And the loss of that is a very serious risk to our national security.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Hellerstedt thinks Texas, under Abbott, did better than most. Unlike Young in Milam County, Abbott survived reelection, despite challenges from the right and left, and has &lt;a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/set/greg-abbott-job-approval-trend"&gt;regained some of the popularity&lt;/a&gt; he lost during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But the real test will be in Texas’ handling of the next public health crisis, which is already here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Measles is spreading rapidly across West Texas, with well over 200 people infected over the course of 50 days and one young child dead. Based on Texas’ declining vaccination rates, the worst is yet to come, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As leaders in West Texas scramble once more to stand up contact tracing, testing and vaccine sites, and quarantine plans, they find themselves &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/10/rural-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;still without the resources&lt;/a&gt; they need to address a disease outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The state and federal government have stepped in to help, but top leaders, including Abbott, have hardly addressed the outbreak in public, let alone encouraged vaccination. Conservative Fort Worth Rep. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/nate-schatzline/"&gt;Nate Schatzline&lt;/a&gt; posted &lt;a href="https://x.com/NateSchatzline/status/1897783600499593727?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"&gt;a video on X&lt;/a&gt; lauding the low vaccination rates at his children’s school, celebrating that they “honor the wishes of moms and dads over any type of health official.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;This leaves local health officials to battle both measles and the lasting distrust of a pandemic-weary public. There’s been some increased uptake at vaccine clinics since the death was reported, Cook, in Lubbock, said, but there’s also been rampant misinformation, public resistance and even the threat of mass infection events like measles parties.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We have plenty of vaccines, we’re figuring out the logistics, but if we can’t get people to take it, this is just going to get worse,” he said. “People forget how bad this can be … We still have COVID deaths. We still have flu deaths. And now, measles deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Unlike COVID, there’s a safe, effective measles vaccine already on the market, which will prevent this from becoming a pandemic. But, public health experts say, there will be a next pandemic at some point, possibly sooner than we realize. And no matter the crisis, be it a regional outbreak or a global pandemic, Texas will need the trust and cooperation of the public to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;It’s clear from this outbreak, public health experts and front-line responders say, that trust has been tested and, in too many cases, has disappeared entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I’m afraid if we have another pandemic, it would be worse,” Guajardo said. “Not because of the pandemic itself, but because of people choosing to believe what they want.”&lt;/p&gt;
