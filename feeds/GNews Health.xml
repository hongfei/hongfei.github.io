For years, people only really thought about their liver when they were drinking too much or when a doctor brought up scary stuff like hepatitis. But now? Everyone’s talking about fatty liver, detoxing, enzyme levels, and all things liver-related—and here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is quietly becoming a global epidemic. You don’t need to be a drinker to have liver issues anymore—junk food, sugar, sedentary lifestyle, and even stress can mess it up. And most people don’t even realize they have a problem until it's advanced. Secondly, your liver is your body’s main detox organ. It filters out all the stuff you throw at it—alcohol, meds, pollutants, processed foods, you name it. So if your liver isn’t in top shape, neither are you. From hormonal imbalances to acne to chronic fatigue—yep, your liver might be the culprit. Also, the rise in fitness culture and functional medicine is making people think beyond just abs and protein shakes. Now, it's about feeling good inside out—and that means showing some love to the organ that quietly keeps you alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Dr Saurabh Sethi, who is very popular on social media shared how liver diseases progress. Not just this, the doctor shared two ways to keep the liver healthy. Dr Sethi explains how a liver disease progresses from simple fatty liver disease to inflammation and cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video, Dr Sethi recommends two ways to keep the liver healthy: reducing alcohol consumption and staying metabolically healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Want a healthy liver? Cut the booze and fix that metabolic mess&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about that one organ that works harder than your boss and rarely gets credit: your liver. It’s your body’s detox machine, fuel processor, fat regulator, and overall superhero. And guess what? It’s under attack—every single day—especially if you’re living on a diet of fries, sugar, zero movement, and weekend binge-drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, two big villains in this story? Alcohol and poor metabolic health. But the good news? You have more control than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up, alcohol. We all know heavy drinking can wreck your liver. But what a lot of people don’t realize is that even moderate drinking, when done regularly, can sneakily damage your liver over time. The liver breaks down alcohol, and in the process, it produces toxic byproducts like acetaldehyde. That stuff is no joke—it inflames your liver and triggers scarring. Over time, this can lead to fatty liver, fibrosis, and even cirrhosis. The scary part? Most of this happens quietly, without symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting back—or quitting altogether—gives your liver breathing room to heal. Yes, your liver can actually regenerate, but only if you stop beating it up with round after round of alcohol. Even cutting down to a few drinks a week instead of daily can make a huge difference. Think of it like giving your liver a break from overtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there’s metabolic health. Your liver doesn’t just suffer when you drink—it also takes a hit when your blood sugar is out of whack, you’re gaining belly fat, or you’re insulin-resistant. That’s what we call poor metabolic health, and it’s become the new silent killer. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now one of the most common liver problems worldwide, and yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like: fat accumulating in your liver even if you don’t drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens because your liver plays a major role in processing sugar and fat. So when your body is constantly dealing with high blood sugar levels (hello, processed carbs and sodas), it stores the excess as fat—including in the liver. Add in low physical activity and weight gain around the waist, and you’ve got a recipe for liver overload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what can you do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cut the sugar. Move more. Eat more whole foods. Get better sleep. Keep your weight in check. Basically, if you clean up your lifestyle—even just a little—your liver responds fast. Drop 5–10% of your body weight and your fatty liver risk drops too. Start walking daily, and your insulin levels improve. Get better sleep and inflammation goes down. It’s all connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to go on crazy juice cleanses or buy “liver detox” powders. Your best bet is to reduce alcohol, eat like you care about your body, and stay metabolically healthy. Your liver is tough—but even superheroes need backup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 05:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>哈佛大学的研究表明，维生素D实际上可能会减缓衰老-印度时报 | Harvard study says Vitamin D may actually slow down aging - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7gFBVV95cUxQc2NqdGpOc0pacm83LVRhMGZ4ck9zWm5TNW5RdWM3U0QzSGZHVy1DZjhUaVFGeWZVZng0V0hiemlTOUxGMVVJT092OG9fczVCSVdqTDRwRjJXeWhoNUJaTWd5SDA4OUtfV0trUXR6OTFhUXl4RngwZHFraXpORzBFemNIbW4wOVBkY1Fyek80c2phalozWE1SYzIxY1g2TGJORVV0RDRqdXVUMUFfYWZKaS11ZGlFeV9RRS1ZR0QtNXJzOHZGN2xyQjFuZXotUnpEV2k3UVM1M1JYWlBjQWM4Y2ZYeUN3cVB3S3ZDejF3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if popping a daily vitamin could help keep you younger—at least at the cellular level? A new study from researchers at Harvard-affiliated Mass General Brigham and the Medical College of Georgia says that vitamin D supplements might actually slow down biological aging. Yes, you read that right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, focused on telomeres—tiny protective caps at the ends of your chromosomes. As we age, these tips wear down, which is linked to age-related diseases like heart problems, certain cancers, and more. The shorter the telomeres, the more worn out your cells are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, here’s where it gets cool: Researchers looked at data from the well-known VITAL study—a long-term clinical trial where participants were randomly given either vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day), omega-3 fatty acids (1 g/day), or a placebo. The telomere sub-study followed over 1,000 people (women 55+ and men 50+) for up to four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results? Those taking vitamin D had significantly less telomere shortening compared to those on placebo. In fact, vitamin D slowed the rate of cellular aging by what would’ve been the equivalent of nearly three years! That’s a pretty big deal when you're trying to keep your cells (and yourself) feeling young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3s, on the other hand, didn’t seem to make much of a difference in this case—at least not for telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is always welcome, this study adds to growing evidence that vitamin D does more than just support your bones and immunity. It may also be quietly working behind the scenes to keep your cells younger, longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“VITAL is the first large-scale and long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres and preserve telomere length,” said co-author JoAnn Manson, the principal investigator of VITAL and chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women’s Health at Harvard Medical School. “This is of particular interest because VITAL had also shown benefits of vitamin D in reducing inflammation and lowering risks of selected chronic diseases of aging, such as advanced cancer and autoimmune disease,” said Manson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted,” said Haidong Zhu, first author of the report and a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is one of those nutrients that quietly does a ton of important stuff in your body—and most of us don’t even realize we’re running low on it. Nicknamed the “sunshine vitamin” because your body makes it when sunlight hits your skin, vitamin D helps your bones stay strong by making sure you absorb enough calcium. Without it, your bones can get weak, brittle, and way more prone to breaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s just the beginning. Vitamin D also supports your immune system—so you're better equipped to fight off colds, flu, and even chronic inflammation. Some studies say it may help improve your mood, too, and there’s growing research linking low vitamin D to issues like depression, fatigue, and brain fog. The catch? A lot of us don’t get enough sun, especially if we’re indoors all day or live in cloudy places. That’s where food and supplements come in—fatty fish, egg yolks, fortified milk, or a daily D3 capsule can help fill the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t ghost your vitamin D. So if you’ve been slacking on your vitamin D intake (especially if you're not getting much sun), this might be the nudge you needed to start adding it to your daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 02:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7gFBVV95cUxQc2NqdGpOc0pacm83LVRhMGZ4ck9zWm5TNW5RdWM3U0QzSGZHVy1DZjhUaVFGeWZVZng0V0hiemlTOUxGMVVJT092OG9fczVCSVdqTDRwRjJXeWhoNUJaTWd5SDA4OUtfV0trUXR6OTFhUXl4RngwZHFraXpORzBFemNIbW4wOVBkY1Fyek80c2phalozWE1SYzIxY1g2TGJORVV0RDRqdXVUMUFfYWZKaS11ZGlFeV9RRS1ZR0QtNXJzOHZGN2xyQjFuZXotUnpEV2k3UVM1M1JYWlBjQWM4Y2ZYeUN3cVB3S3ZDejF3</guid></item><item><title>被遗忘的癌症在年轻人中激增，专家们感到困惑- ScienceAlert | A Forgotten Cancer Is Surging in Young People, And Experts Are Puzzled - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOYk9LaDhYUWV4cWNKLUhZQ1pJMUhhN09OS212bENaRXMyVllaaXJ5SlpyZ1VfcXY4U3pIeWUxWTM2TEFKeW9kRG1IMEFnX25JUmRIRFNvNElxR0tuR3d5V2M0TlYyMFZTNEFleFNQSnlHbHMyY2ZYVEVxV2JucWdVMHZZdGx0VVpCTGlxaDc5WDNfSjVmbVBYRkdKZWphWVU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3200132/"&gt;Appendix cancer&lt;/a&gt; is a condition that, until recently, was so rare that most people never gave it a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, it was the kind of disease that doctors might encounter only once or twice in a career, and it was almost always found in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/appendix-cancers-rise-younger-generations-study-finds-rcna211796"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; a surprising and concerning trend is emerging: &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479"&gt;appendix cancer is being diagnosed more often&lt;/a&gt;, and it's increasingly affecting people in their 30s, 40s and even younger. This shift has left many experts puzzled and searching for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appendix is a small, finger-shaped pouch attached to the large intestine. Its purpose in the body is &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Why-do-Humans-have-an-Appendix.aspx"&gt;still debated&lt;/a&gt;, but it's best known for causing appendicitis, a painful inflammation that often requires emergency surgery. What's less well known is that  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="164404" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; can develop in the appendix, usually without any warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, has shown that the number of appendix cancer cases has increased dramatically among people born after the 1970s. In fact, the incidence has tripled or even quadrupled in younger generations compared with those born in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall numbers are still small (appendix cancer affects just a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9418812/#:%7E:text=Overall%2C%20the%20incidence%20of%20appendiceal,5.1%20to%2011.2%20per%20cent."&gt;handful of people&lt;/a&gt; per million each year) the rapid rise is striking. Even more notable is that about one in three cases now occurs in adults under 50, a much higher proportion than seen in other types of gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what's behind this surge? &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-wellbeing/vitamin-d-colon-cancer-b2744234.html"&gt;No one knows for sure&lt;/a&gt;, but one of the first suspects is the dramatic change in lifestyle and environment over the past several decades. Obesity rates have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3543235/"&gt;soared&lt;/a&gt; since the 1970s, and being overweight is a known risk factor for many cancers, including those of the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, diets have shifted toward more processed foods, sugary drinks, and red or processed meats, all of which have been linked to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/king-charles-is-changing-his-diet-to-keep-his-cancer-at-bay-heres-what-the-evidence-says-245582"&gt;increased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; in other &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942"&gt;parts of the gut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity has also &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/exercise-proves-powerful-in-preventing-colon-cancer-recurrence-new-study-257983"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt;, with more people spending long hours sitting at desks or in front of screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that we are being exposed to new environmental factors that previous generations didn't face. The industrialisation of food production, the widespread use of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39518141/"&gt;plastics and chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, and changes in water quality might all play a role. However, the evidence is still in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hard to detect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes appendix cancer especially challenging is how difficult it is to detect. Unlike colon cancer, which can sometimes be found early through screening colonoscopies, appendix cancer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33094592/"&gt;usually flies under the radar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms, if they appear at all, are vague and easy to dismiss. People might experience mild abdominal pain, bloating or changes in bowel habits, which are common complaints for many benign conditions. As a result, most cases are only discovered after surgery for suspected appendicitis, when it's often too late for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the rise in cases, there is no routine screening test for appendix cancer. The disease is simply too rare to justify widespread screening, and the appendix can be difficult to visualise with standard imaging or endoscopy. This means that both patients and doctors need to be extra vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone experiences persistent or unusual abdominal symptoms, especially if they're under 50, it's important not to ignore them. Early investigation and prompt treatment can make a significant difference in outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in appendix cancer among younger adults is part of a broader trend seen in other gastrointestinal cancers, such as those of the colon and stomach. These cancers, too, are being diagnosed more often in people under 50, suggesting that shared risk factors may be at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this shift are complex and probably involve a mix of genetics, lifestyle, environment and perhaps even changes in our &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bug-drugs-bacteria-based-cancer-therapies-are-finally-overcoming-barriers-251278"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; – the bacteria in our intestines that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39882224/"&gt;live with us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, antibiotics have been used more frequently, both in medicine and in agriculture. This widespread use can alter the balance of bacteria in our guts, which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7916407/"&gt;might influence cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some recent research suggests that early-life exposure to antibiotics could have &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-among-young-people-could-changes-to-childrens-gut-bacteria-explain-why-255176"&gt;long-term effects on the digestive system&lt;/a&gt;, but more studies are needed to confirm this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164410" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging.jpg" alt="Different types of tablets or pills in foil packs" class="size-full wp-image-164410" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging-484x415.jpg 484w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging-600x514.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164410" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Could early-life exposure to antibiotics have something to do with the rise in appendix cancer? (PublicDomainPictures/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the best advice is to focus on prevention and awareness. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet rich in fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and staying physically active are all steps that can lower the risk of many types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol intake are also &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alcohol-plays-a-major-role-in-new-cancer-cases/"&gt;important&lt;/a&gt;. While these measures can't guarantee protection against appendix cancer, they are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;proven strategies&lt;/a&gt; for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are working hard to unravel the mystery of why appendix cancer is rising so rapidly among younger generations. Understanding the causes will be crucial for developing better ways to prevent, detect and treat this rare but increasingly important disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, raising awareness among healthcare providers and the public is essential. By recognising the signs and taking action when symptoms arise, we can improve the chances of catching appendix cancer early and giving patients the best possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of appendix cancer's rise is a reminder that even rare diseases can become more common when our environment and lifestyles change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also a call to action for further research and for all of us to pay attention to our bodies, seek medical advice when something feels off, and support efforts to understand and combat this puzzling trend.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258607/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

A new study suggests that these common medications might ease the mental decline linked with this devastating condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karolinska Institutet&lt;/a&gt; found a compelling connection between statin use and slower cognitive deterioration. Their findings, recently published in &lt;a href="https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-023-01360-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer Research and Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, offer cautious optimism for a disease that affects millions worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team examined data from a national registry of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dementia. Those who were taking statins experienced a gentler decline in thinking ability than those who weren’t on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Statins, long hailed for lowering cholesterol, might offer an unexpected benefit beyond heart health.

Because the research was observational, it can’t prove that &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/common-cholesterol-drugs-could-stop-cancer-growth/"&gt;statins&lt;/a&gt; directly cause the slower decline. Still, the pattern they saw raises important questions worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controlled clinical trials will be essential to confirm whether statins truly offer this cognitive shield. Until then, the link remains a promising lead, but not a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/us-prescription-drug-prices-are-2-78-times-those-in-other-wealthy-nations-study-finds/"&gt;prescription-ready&lt;/a&gt; solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, doctors have been wary of giving statins to people with dementia. Concerns over side effects—particularly confusion—have made many cautious about their use in these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Interaction between the patient’s and medication’s characteristics potentially influence the cognitive effects of statins. Two separate cholesterol pools in the body are thought to be connected to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), central and peripheral.

Her team believes these insights could spark a fresh look at the medications’ role in brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s too early to change treatment guidelines, the evidence opens the door for further research. For now, statins remain a potential ally—one that deserves closer study in the fight against Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_promising_but_preliminary_step"&gt;A Promising but Preliminary Step&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results of this study provide hope, they also highlight the complexity of Alzheimer's disease and the challenges of identifying effective treatments. The potential benefits of statins for certain patients warrant further investigation through rigorous clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the results of the study do not mean that we now have evidence that people with dementia should be treated with statins. But on the other hand, we can't see any support for not doing so. So, if a person needs statins for high &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-study-reveals-the-dietary-secret-to-brain-health-and-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood lipids&lt;/a&gt;, a dementia diagnosis should not stop the treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study incorporated data from over 15,500 dementia patients who also had indications for lipid-lowering treatment. Among them, nearly 11,000 received statin therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the patients on statins displayed slightly higher cognitive test scores despite having higher rates of conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-research-reveals-the-cause-and-cure-for-high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, all of which are established risk factors for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garcia-Ptacek elucidates that their research began with the hypothesis that statins might decelerate dementia progression. They cast a wide net to explore if there was any evidence to substantiate this theory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Cognitive decline, evaluated with change in MMSE score over time, in statin users compared to non-users of statins. The graph shows the association between increasing doses of statin treatment and MMSE over time, as predicted from the model.

Previous clinical studies have explored this idea, but they yielded negative results. Garcia-Ptacek and her team believe that these trials might have been too small to detect significant differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their approach focuses on pinpointing specific patient groups within the Alzheimer's spectrum that might benefit the most from statin treatment, and understanding why they respond positively. This preliminary study sets the stage for more refined investigations and potential &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-new-vaccine-could-protect-against-all-future-coronavirus-disease-outbreaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;future clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study hints at the potential benefits of statins in Alzheimer's patients, it serves as a critical stepping stone in unraveling the complex relationship between these drugs and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Cognitive decline, evaluated with change in MMSE score over time, in simvastatin compared to atorvastatin users.

Until then, cautious optimism remains the prevailing sentiment in the pursuit of a breakthrough in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-discovered-a-significant-link-between-vaccinations-and-alzheimer-s-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer's treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="most_common_types_of_statins_cholesterol_medications_"&gt;Most common types of statins / cholesterol medications:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atorvastatin (Lipitor): &lt;/strong&gt;This is the most widely used statin and is effective at lowering all &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-reveal-how-and-why-blood-types-evolved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;types of cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.

The process produces the same chalky scale that lines well-used kettles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the experiment, those newborn flakes drifted through the swirling water and latched onto free-floating plastic, wrapping each shard until it sank and knitted itself into the growing crust at the bottom of the pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests on three common resins – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/filter-feeders-transform-microplastics-into-a-bigger-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene&lt;/a&gt; – showed that at least four-fifths of these particles wound up trapped after a five-minute boil and a short cool-down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That figure climbed near ninety percent when the water held about 300 milligrams of calcium carbonate per liter, a level typical of hard-water regions from San Antonio to Indianapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-minerals-matter"&gt;Why minerals matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water chemistry varies wildly across the United States. In soft water, where dissolved calcium dips below roughly 60 milligrams per liter, the Guangzhou group still recorded a twenty-five percent plastic drop. That is helpful but leaves most debris adrift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hard water, by contrast, supplies more building blocks for limescale. The higher the mineral load, the more surfaces form for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/kitchen-germs-are-an-underestimated-threat-to-public-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plastic to cling to&lt;/a&gt;, so the removal rate rises quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the flakes grow fast, they can be rinsed or brushed away from cookware, taking the microplastics with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any fragments that stay suspended can be caught in a paper coffee filter – an item already parked next to many kitchen sinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method costs pennies, requires no electricity beyond the burner, and fits households that lack space or funds for advanced filtration systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evidence-outside-the-lab"&gt;Evidence outside the lab&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that everyday heat can curb&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-are-widespread-in-the-seafood-we-eat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; invisible plastics&lt;/a&gt; meshes with recent field studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, scientists sampling bottled and tap water across Europe tallied anywhere from 19 to 1,154 particles per liter, with the highest counts of microplastics found in municipal supplies drawn from mineral-rich aquifers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By targeting the same minerals, the boiling trick offers a stopgap while policymakers debate stricter water standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health agencies such as the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; state that current data are too thin to draw firm links between microplastic intake and disease, yet they encourage cutting exposure where practical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/environmental-health-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The U.S. Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;, in its strategic blueprint on environmental health, echoes that stance and calls for simple interventions people can adopt today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tips-for-the-kitchen"&gt;Tips for the kitchen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your kettle already furs up between cleanings, you likely benefit most. Bring the water to a rolling boil for five minutes; let it stand until steam subsides, then pour slowly, leaving the whitish crust behind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give the kettle a periodic scrub to wash the captured plastics down the drain – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-are-escaping-from-water-treatment-plants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;municipal treatment plants&lt;/a&gt; are better equipped to trap larger, bonded particles than loose nanoscale ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents in soft-water zones can still gain a modest cut by adding food-grade calcium, such as a pinch of pharmaceutical lime, before heating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team cautions that mineral additives should stay within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt;) secondary limit of 120 milligrams per liter for calcium to avoid taste issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-boiling-water-vs-microplastics"&gt;Boiling water vs. microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boiling is no silver bullet. Engineers are experimenting with bio-based filters that trap plastic shreds in wastewater plants, while chemists &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-process-converts-microplastics-into-valuable-graphene-wonder-material/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;explore enzymes&lt;/a&gt; that nibble bottles back into harmless molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Guangzhou study shows how an old-school practice can chip away at a modern pollutant without fancy gear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing stovetop heat with a cheap paper filter slashes the largest doses that reach our mugs, even as science hunts for long-term fixes upstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic pollution will not vanish overnight, yet this research reminds us that progress sometimes hides in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00081" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Environmental Science and Technology Letters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 23:16:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNTVVMenFFalZHUXV3ZVpseVYyYWIteWJZbHZHMC1HbWltWHdLcEk1MzE5ODRxZmhacVBYSlg1eTBhV09kWW1wMWFkNEU5SEdOZ2FURzA1NzhkRUhodmt5cnpwS3BBd3lfUTQ2b25mbnZKRzZVOWpIckFpTDExWGwzaFBPNDA5eWp4RHpDcEZPanIwSjg</guid></item><item><title>露营者的水箱可能携带严重疾病，以下是修复方法- Autopian | Your Camper’s Water Tank Could Be Carrying Serious Diseases, Here’s How To Fix It - The Autopian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNVzZQamdUUVQ4MWZyZnpfbmxuMW9LSGphd2hQTWxhSUJ4elFkSkluaVRPSEp5azQ3S0RvbjVDTDRfQ19heEM2Q1Izak0xTlFfZDNoZDRBX292bWs0amZpMHJ2OGgtSVRUeUJKZnhKQ1NxMEtvQmRUSnVmZ0FXQkl4c2ROTGQ2UkVqbmJ2M0o5b3RkZjRINWt4anVramdTUlZtV095OUhUUUJZQTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="elementor-widget-container"&gt;
			&lt;p class="mailmunch-forms-before-post"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much RV that’s built some sort of self-contained standard has a tank for fresh water. You fill that tank and can use it for drinking water, showers, and cleaning food. But there can be a hidden danger in your RV’s water tank. If you never clean this tank out, it can be a vessel for serious diseases, possibly even one that could cause your death. Here’s how you can help protect yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern about the cleanliness of RV freshwater tanks has been raised recently following a May 29 report by the Disease Control and Prevention. The report documents the case of an RV owner who used tap water from their RV for nasal irrigation. This person ended up catching a brain infection, which sadly turned fatal. What the CDC concluded in its investigation is chilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The self-contained RV has existed throughout much of camper history. In essence, a self-contained unit is one that is capable of operating away from a source of power, sewer, and water. So, you’ll have a battery or generator for power, holding tanks for your wastes, and a tank for potable water. Some of the earliest motorhomes had self-contained features, and the 1958 Airstream International is often credited as being one of the first truly self-contained travel trailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-207844 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa.jpg" alt="Adirondackeaa" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa.jpg 2189w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-300x150.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-768x384.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-2048x1024.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2189px) 100vw, 2189px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features are critical if you want to use your camper somewhere that’s not an improved campground. Every year, I spend a week with over 40,000 campers at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, depending on my family’s travel trailer’s water stores, battery, and a generator to be comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheryl and I have a hard rule to never use the RV’s water tank for internal use. This is because when we first started using the trailer for boondocking at AirVenture in 2023, we learned that there was something horribly wrong with the trailer’s water tank. The tank emitted a foul odor when we filled it, replacing the air inside with water. Then, when we used said water, we found little black particles in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_207848" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207848" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207848 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash.jpg" alt="Eaawatersplash" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash.jpg 2560w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-300x169.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-768x432.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-207848" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;My family’s 2007 Adirondack violently ejecting a drinking water hose. Mercedes Streeter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family has owned this trailer since 2016, and I asked my parents about the last time they had the tank cleaned. They didn’t even know that was a thing, so it’s safe to assume that it hasn’t been cleaned in &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; a decade. If my parents didn’t know that you’re supposed to clean the water tank, how many other Americans are the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Tragic Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm"&gt;CDC report&lt;/a&gt; is something of nightmares. Here’s a snippet from it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare, often fatal brain infection caused by the free-living ameba, Naegleria fowleri (1). Infection is typically associated with recreational water activities; however, using tap water when performing nasal irrigation is also a risk factor for PAM (2–4). Improperly maintained municipal water and recreational vehicle (RV) water systems can be a source of waterborne disease; CDC recommends the use of distilled, sterile, or boiled and cooled tap water for nasal irrigation.* Household safe water practices can help prevent waterborne illness associated with RV water systems. This report describes a fatal case of N. fowleri infection associated with improper use of a nasal irrigation device with suspected contaminated tap water from an RV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A previously healthy woman aged 71 years developed severe neurologic symptoms, including fever, headache, and altered mental status within 4 days of using a nasal irrigation device filled with tap water from an RV’s water system at a campground in Texas. Despite medical treatment for a suspected PAM infection, the patient developed seizures and subsequently died 8 days after symptom onset. Laboratory testing at CDC confirmed the presence of N. fowleri in the patient’s cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An epidemiologic investigation conducted by the Texas Department of State Health Services included a review of the patient’s medical and exposure history. The patient had no recreational exposure to fresh water; however, she had reportedly performed nasal irrigation on several occasions using nonboiled water from the RV potable water faucet during the 4 days before illness onset. This practice suggested two water sources of concern. The first was the RV’s potable water tank, which flowed directly to the faucets and shower when a municipal water connection was unavailable. The tank had been filled with water collected on an unknown date before the patient’s purchase of the RV 3 months earlier. The second potential source of contamination was the municipal water system, which was connected by a hose and water filter to the RV potable water system, bypassing the tank, at the time the patient used it for nasal irrigation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC then tested water from the campground and water from the RV’s tanks. No N. fowleri was found in these samples, but the CDC did find that the total chlorine and monochloramine disinfectant levels in the campground’s tap water were below the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s recommended levels. Combined with a low pH level, the presence of free ammonia, and unequal concentrations of active disinfectant, the CDC concluded that it was possible for pathogens to thrive in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples from the RV proved to be even worse, with water quality that was lower quality than than recommended for drinking water, let alone water you’re going to shoot up your nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the CDC couldn’t figure out if the source of the brain infection came from the RV’s tank or the campground’s tap water, and some of the blame might be because the samples were taken 23 days after the patient shot the water up her nose. However, the conclusion was pretty serious, with Texas public health officials and the CDC calling for, among other things, the maintenance of RV water systems and ensuring that municipal water systems are clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so there can be danger in your RV’s water supply. What can you do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_68494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68494" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-68494 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255.jpg" alt="20230724 192312" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255.jpg 2560w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-300x150.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-768x384.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-2048x1024.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-68494" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The water filling station at EAA’s Camp Scholler. Mercedes Streeter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should do is consider where your RV’s water is coming from. Countless campgrounds, especially remote ones, are pulling their water out of a well. As the CDC suggests up there, water straight from a campground’s taps could be dangerous, as the typical person will not know what’s in that water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some campgrounds bring city water into their taps. This water is generally safer and, so long as the delivery system from the campground’s pipes to your RV’s plumbing are clean, then there is less risk here. But even that requires you to assume everything is up to spec. As Joshua Baker of RV dealer Texas RV Guys noted in an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/warnings-rv-water-cdc-woman-texas-died-brain-infection/3857106/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC DFW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, campground water systems aren’t well-regulated, either, so you can’t even trust that the government will keep you safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Water Filtration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your first line of defense is a water filtration system. There are tons of these things commercially available and the simplest of these systems is an inline filter. These filters screw right into the line going from your RV to the spigot at the campground. Some folks who infrequently use their RV might use a cheaper filter like a unit from Clear2O. People who are more serious about clean RV water invest in more expensive systems from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.clearsourcerv.com/collections/clearsource-rv-water-filter-systems"&gt;Clearsource&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goblutech.com/collections/rv-water-filter-systems/products/goblutech-ar3-led-uvc-elite-series-0-2-micron-4-stage-rv-water-filtration-purification-system"&gt;Blu Technology&lt;/a&gt;, which can either be used externally or mounted permanently to the RV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mailmunch-forms-in-post-middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_207851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207851" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207851 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2O_RV_MARINE_INLINE_WATER_F.jpg" alt="Clear2o Rv Marine Inline Water F" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2O_RV_MARINE_INLINE_WATER_F.jpg 955w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2O_RV_MARINE_INLINE_WATER_F-300x300.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2O_RV_MARINE_INLINE_WATER_F-150x150.jpg 150w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2O_RV_MARINE_INLINE_WATER_F-768x768.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2O_RV_MARINE_INLINE_WATER_F-700x700.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-207851" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Clear2O RV in-line filter. – Clear2O&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people also combine more than one system into one, such as an inline filter outside and another filter mounted to their coach, or two different types of filters outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_207852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207852" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207852 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x.jpg" alt="Welcome The Uvc Ar3 3 1080x" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x.jpg 1080w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x-300x225.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-207852" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blu Technology AR3 LED UVC High-Flow 4-Stage RV Water Filter – Blu Technology&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea I’ve seen around RV communities is that multiple filters is better and you want to get a filter that drills down to two microns as much as possible. Some folks will employ other measures, including installing a filter directly onto a faucet by tying it onto the feed line in the cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation of an external filter is about as easy as you would expect, and you connect the filter to your water source and then connect the filter to your motorhome. If you have 36 minutes to spare, RV Youtube channel Our Journey In Myles explains one way to set this up while also reviewing a popular RV filtration system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the types of filters get properly nutty. There are sediment filters, which remove larger suspended matter like sand, scale, and clay from the water supply. Then you have carbon filters, which use activated carbon to absorb and remove impurities, including chemicals and organic contaminants. There are also UV-based water filters, which use UV-C to destroy bacteria and viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another kind of filter that you’ll find is a gravity filter. These are pretty simple filters that use gravity to pull water through a filter, leaving behind contaminants and cleaner water. A very popular gravity filter among RVers is a &lt;a href="https://www.usaberkeyfilters.com/"&gt;Berkey&lt;/a&gt;; however, it’s notable that you wouldn’t be using one of these to take a shower. Instead, they’re more for getting cleaner drinking water. Some people will use a Berkey for drinking water and an inline filter system for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_207853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207853" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207853 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/91Hc-VgR4TL._AC_SL1500.jpg" alt="91hc Vgr4tl. Ac Sl1500" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/91Hc-VgR4TL._AC_SL1500.jpg 1500w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/91Hc-VgR4TL._AC_SL1500-300x225.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/91Hc-VgR4TL._AC_SL1500-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/91Hc-VgR4TL._AC_SL1500-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-207853" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Berkey Filters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folks will even buy a reverse osmosis-based water filtration system and plant it on their countertop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that there is no single answer for what kind of filtration system to use. I would recommend joining a forum for your particular model of RV and seeing what others are using with their rigs. Some &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoRVing/comments/b09ggk/just_upgraded_to_a_clearsource_dual_water_filter/"&gt;people swear by&lt;/a&gt; Clearsource equipment, influencers seem to like Blu Technology rigs, and a lot of people are just &lt;a href="https://alliancervowners.com/forum/threads/water-filtration-blu-tech-clear-source-others.2885/"&gt;creating their own&lt;/a&gt; budget filtration systems using parts from the hardware store meant for residential filtration systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure, I’ll be trying out a water filtration system for myself. I’ve been RVing for over two decades, and yet even I’ve made the mistake of not using any real filtration system. That’s how much water quality gets ignored in the RV world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tank Cleaning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, a water filtration system is really your first line of defense. You also want to make sure that your RV is as clean as possible. Clean water is of little help if it’s getting contaminated by a camper that’s never been cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to clean both your tank and your lines. A commonly cited method for this would be to fill your RV’s tank with a water and bleach solution. A standard guideline is a quarter cup of bleach per 15 gallons of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by draining any water that’s in your RV. Your fresh tank likely has a drain valve on its bottom, and your hot water tank likely has a similar valve. Be sure that your hot water heater is turned off during this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230529_123804-1536x1152.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Your hot water tank might look like this. Mercedes Streeter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve drained your camper, fill up your fresh tank with the bleach and water mix. One easy way to do this would be similar to putting an additive into your car’s gas tank. Put bleach in first using a funnel, then hit it with your water to mix it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’re all filled up with bleachy water, turn on every faucet and shower in the trailer, ensuring to turn on the taps for both the cold and hot water. Turn off these faucets and the shower once you smell bleachy water coming out of all of them. Now, let the solution sit and marinate for between five to 10 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230727_083647-1536x1152x.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mercedes Streeter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you basically want to run the process in reverse. Run your faucets to fill up your waste tanks with the used bleachy water mix. Then, dump your tanks. Now, refill your fresh tank and run the faucets again until you don’t smell bleach anymore. Drain and refill your tank until the bleach has been eliminated. You can probably expect to spend about a day doing this whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not comfortable with bleach or don’t have somewhere to dispose of it (some campgrounds use septic systems), you can also use vinegar or hydrogen peroxide. There are also commercially available tank cleaning products that do a similar job to bleach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_207849" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207849" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207849 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2OTANKFRESHWATERTANK_SYSTEM-e1749676755880.jpg" alt="Clear2otankfreshwatertank System" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2OTANKFRESHWATERTANK_SYSTEM-e1749676755880.jpg 1000w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2OTANKFRESHWATERTANK_SYSTEM-e1749676755880-300x240.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2OTANKFRESHWATERTANK_SYSTEM-e1749676755880-768x614.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-207849" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Clear2O&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most shops recommend sanitizing your RV tank once every three to six months. Doing it with frequency is important because you don’t want mold, bacteria, parasites, algae, and other nasty stuff growing in your tank. Likewise, if you’ll be storing your camper after completing this process, you’ll want to store it with the tank emptied out rather than sitting for months with water just sitting around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, many people, myself included, just buy jugs of water to drink out of and use the camper’s water supply only for cleaning and showers. However, admittedly, carrying around gallons of water is annoying. So, a lot of folks will go through the work to create a pretty comprehensive filtration system so that they can drink water from a campground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what you choose with filtration, I highly recommend that, at the very least, you clean out your RV’s water tank regularly. It’s easy to ignore something like this because your tank is out of sight and sometimes out of mind, but for the safety of yourself and your family, take a day out of your busy schedule to make sure your RV is as clean as it can be. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But now, a new study presented at NUTRITION 2025, the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, suggests that diet drinks might not be the best thing to sip. Study authors also published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Current Developments in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a 30-year study that started in 1985. It included 4,654 adults, almost 55% women, with an average age of 25 when the study began—also called the baseline. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants’ diets were assessed at baseline and again at years seven and 20. Specifically, researchers were looking for the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290373/a-buyers-guide-to-sugar-substitutes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cumulative average intake of artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt;, diet beverages, aspartame and sucralose. Participants were placed into categories, called quintiles, based on their intake of these substances.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers were also looking for diabetes diagnoses over the 30 years of follow-up, of which there were 691 cases. They defined diabetes as a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290761/best-time-to-check-blood-glucose-after-meal/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fasting glucose higher than 126 mg/dL&lt;/a&gt;, glucose higher than ≥ 200 mg/dL after a glucose tolerance test, A1c higher than 6.5% or the use of diabetes medications at follow-up visits. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Statistical analyses were adjusted for certain demographics, including age, sex, race, education, energy intake, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol intake, diet quality and family history of diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers found:

&lt;li&gt;Compared to those with lower intakes, those with the highest intake of saccharin, an artificial sweetener sometimes found in diet drinks, had a 110% increased risk of diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know it’s important to limit sugar, and beverages sweetened with sugar can be a major contributor of added sugar in our diets. But this study suggests that replacing regular sodas and other sweetened beverages with diet ones may not benefit you in the ways you’re hoping. It also suggests that they may even significantly raise your risk of developing diabetes—exactly the opposite of what you might think. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The scientific community has gone back and forth on the safety of artificial sweeteners. And while the FDA lists artificial sweeteners as “generally recognized as safe,” we also know that research is mixed on sugar substitutes—particularly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-artificial-sweeteners-bad-for-you-8431961" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;when it comes to your gut health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study didn’t include sugar alcohols, a type of artificial sweetener, but &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/new-study-links-erythritol-with-higher-blood-clot-risk-8695390" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that they, too, may pose some risk, including for blood clots, which increase the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-foods-to-eat-for-lower-stroke-risk-11722148" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk of stroke and heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study raises a lot of questions, which is a good thing with research. We still need more information to know if it’s only the artificial sweeteners raising the risk of diabetes, or if it's the combination of artificial sweeteners with other additives in the beverages. We also can’t know for sure if other additives in the drinks increase diabetes risk on their own, or if it’s a combination of the diet drinks and a poor diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite all these questions, here’s what we do know. Soda is far from being a whole food, but everything can fit in a varied and balanced eating pattern. Having a soda now and then is probably fine for most people. The key is how regularly you’re taking a soda break.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you lean on your favorite fizzy pop to get you through a mid-afternoon slump, consider replacing it with an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/energizing-nut-free-snack-recipes-8549709" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;energizing snack&lt;/a&gt;, like some nuts and cheese for a mix of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protein and healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;. You could even take a quick walk or do some push-ups against your desk to get your blood pumping. Changing your physiology is one of the quickest ways to change your energy state. And making sure you’re staying well-hydrated and well-fueled may help prevent the slump to begin with. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you like soda for the bubbles, consider replacing it with an unsweetened &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052890/sparkling-water-soda-water-club-soda-seltzer-water-mineral-water-tonic-whats-the-difference/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sparkling water&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll get all of the fizz without the additives that soda contains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that those who drink high amounts of diet sodas and other diet beverages may significantly increase their risk of diabetes. Soda, whether sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners, may be a delicious option now and then, but should probably not be a regular on anyone’s menu. If you’re a regular soda imbiber, begin replacing one soda a day with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/this-gut-friendly-soda-is-my-go-to-drink-for-dry-january-8772967" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural beverages&lt;/a&gt;, including water, sparkling water or unsweetened tea. Milk and juice in moderation can work, too, and add essential nutrients. Over time, continue replacing your daily sodas one at a time until you get to the level you feel good with.&lt;br&gt;

In the web-based Big Joy Project, nearly 17,600 participants from around the world performed micro-acts like sharing joyful moments and listing things they’re grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed higher positive emotions, lower stress, and better sleep, especially among younger, Black, Hispanic, and socially disadvantaged individuals. This is the first large-scale study to demonstrate that a short, low-effort intervention can provide meaningful mental and physical health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short &amp;amp; Effective:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a few minutes per day for 7 days improved wellbeing, sleep, and stress levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equity in Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Younger, Black, Hispanic, and disadvantaged groups saw the greatest benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalable Model:&lt;/strong&gt; Minimal time commitment means greater accessibility for broader populations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers, led by UC San Francisco, tested the effectiveness of a weeklong, web-based wellbeing intervention, known as the Big Joy Project. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consisted of daily micro-acts, which included asking someone to share a fun, inspiring, or proud moment, making a gratitude list, and performing a kind act to brighten someone’s day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 17,600 people from around the world participated: most were from the United States, Canada and Great Britain (71%), female (84%), white (74%), with at least some college education (94%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What They Discovered:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the seven-day intervention, participants reported higher levels of wellbeing and positive emotions, and a stronger belief that one’s own behavior can promote happiness. They also reported decreased stress, and improved health and sleep quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Younger, Black and Hispanic, and socially disadvantaged participants benefited the most.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why It Matters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improvements in wellbeing are associated with a lower risk of future mental illness and better physical health. “People with higher wellbeing are less likely to develop chronic conditions, like cardiovascular diseases, and have reduced mortality in both healthy and unhealthy populations,” said senior author Elissa Epel, PhD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web-based wellbeing interventions that last several weeks and take 3 to 4 hours a week to complete have shown favorable results. But this is the first time that a short intervention has shown such strong benefits, and it could work for more people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people lack the time, motivation, and resources to commit to these lengthier programs, and they may be more likely to drop out,” said first author Darwin Guevarra, PhD, who is also affiliated with Miami University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were excited to get positive results in a program that required just a few minutes each day for a week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding and Disclosures:&lt;/strong&gt; Smith and Callahan are from the nonprofit that partially funded the Big Joy Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this happiness and psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#085b7d726966666d26446d616f60487d6b7b6e266d6c7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Suzanne Leigh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsf.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Suzanne Leigh – UCSF&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2196/72053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scaling a Brief Digital Well-Being Intervention (the Big Joy Project) and Sociodemographic Moderators: Single-Group Pre-Post Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Elissa Epel et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Medical Internet Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaling a Brief Digital Well-Being Intervention (the Big Joy Project) and Sociodemographic Moderators: Single-Group Pre-Post Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional well-being interventions lead to better mental and physical health. However, most of these interventions have been tested on relatively homogeneous samples, with few interventions large enough to examine whether key sociodemographic factors impact outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, barriers to engagement include access and high participant burden. We developed a brief web-based intervention to address these barriers and tested the effects across sociodemographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study aims to examine the effectiveness of a brief, low-burden digital well-being intervention in improving emotional well-being and health-related outcomes across a diverse global sample. It investigates how key sociodemographic factors, such as age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, financial strain, and subjective social status, moderate intervention effects. The goal is to identify which groups benefit most, informing the scalability and public health potential of digital well-being interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a single-group pre-post study spanning from 2022 to 2024 using a web-based, multicomponent, week-long well-being intervention requiring 5 to 10 minutes of daily activity (the Big Joy Project).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a global convenience sample recruited via open web-based enrollment, we assessed pre-post changes in emotional well-being, positive emotions, happiness agency, perceived stress, self-reported health, and sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, participants also reported sociodemographic characteristics. We used mixed-effects linear models to examine pre-post changes in the outcomes and sociodemographic moderators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample (N=17,598) consisted of individuals from 169 countries and territories, with broad representation across sociodemographic groups; however, the sample was predominantly White, female, and had at least a high school or college education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the intervention, participants showed significant within-subjects effect size increases in emotional well-being (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=0.48; &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;.001), positive emotions (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=0.45; &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;.001), and happiness agency (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=0.44; &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, participants showed a decrease in perceived stress (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=–0.35; &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;.001) and an increase in self-reported health (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=0.07; &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;.001) and sleep quality (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=0.15; &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;.001). There was a clear dose-response pattern across outcomes: participants who engaged in more daily practices showed greater improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a strong pattern of social disadvantage moderating these effects, with groups experiencing greater social disadvantage showing larger benefits across most outcomes. For example, those with lower education, greater financial strain, or lower subjective social status and those identifying as individuals from racial or ethnic minority groups (Black or Hispanic) all showed larger improvements across well-being outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, younger people had greater increases in emotional well-being and greater decreases in perceived stress compared to older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brief, low-intensity intervention showed meaningful improvements in well-being and stress, comparable to those seen in longer, more intensive digital well-being interventions. Sociodemographic groups that are at higher risk of poor mental health benefited more from the intervention, highlighting its potential for scalable public health impact. Testing this intervention with a randomized controlled trial design will be important.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 20:04:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5RR3EzSXM0cTJfWTFlekQ1ejkxODVkb3JrN3duMThOSEh1ZU5ud0s4ZTh2eTlfUjE3WkV0MDhCSUl6VWxRY1J6a0JETm9SUDUyRk1LeldCQXVTYXBhaVpOdHRhc1p1b01waXpJemYxTXdvdVY0X0E</guid></item><item><title>新型冠状病毒变异与痛苦的“剃须刀片喉咙”症状有关-旧金山纪事报 | New COVID variant linked to painful ‘razor blade throat’ symptom - San Francisco Chronicle</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQZDkwSG5Ja1BpTnZrcWcwaU1tSTRiajBrRFNJb0Nzcmc1MUUxRjVZTDFFaHVPV2dfbEY5SHdaVzZ3SUE0Ni1wY2tEZC1kM25IU3FUQ2hwWkhNYWFrUGlxc01zNWZ2eFREVEJkRjE0NC1JSjUycUpqb1hIZGR2anRxek04V0s3RDBQWHJ0aWI4V1Zfei1LRnVEYlphcVlGZEgtcERHQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Light particles can also be functionalized to only bind to cancer cells, mitigating damage done to healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The treatment itself is highly targeted because the atoms of dye bind to the receptors on cancer cells while leaving healthy cells largely untouched. It has already shown in followup trials to kill colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next step will be determining whether this same molecular jackhammer will destroy cancer cells in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This study is about a different way to treat cancer using mechanical forces at the molecular scale,’ said Ciceron Ayala-Orozco, a Rice research scientist who is a lead author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If scaled up to human patients, the treatment's impact could be sweeping. An estimated 1.5 million Americans are living with melanoma, 1.4 million have colorectal cancer, and 300,000 men have prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2025, approximately 316,950 women will be diagnosed with severe, invasive breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unassuming dye found in hospitals nationwide is a key feature of vibronic-driven action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After it binds to receptors on melanoma cells, it is assaulted with infrared light, which triggers an earthquake in the cell. The dye atoms begin to vibrate in unison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The dye's electrons sync up into a "plasmon"—a wave of collective motion. This energy couples with the molecule's natural vibrations, making the entire structure shudder at 41 trillion times per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The violent oscillating energy is transferred directly into the cell’s fatty membrane, while nanoscale holes tear open, allowing fluid and foreign molecules to flood in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ciceron Ayala-Orozco, a Rice research scientist who is a lead author on the study, said: ‘This study is about a different way to treat cancer using mechanical forces at the molecular scale'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This fast-moving mechanical force is such that ‘anything around it will be disassembled,’ Ayala-Orozco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cancer cell crumbles as the holes poked in its membrane increase, and dies without further use of any drug or radiation treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Texas team's findings were published in the journal&lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-023-01383-y?fbclid=IwY2xjawK2jK9leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFHY2NRaWFJQTJzZ2N4VGpHAR5Aubq0u0qi0UftpDThSpHEqFwUsFJdbrc79LRcxVmzWo7-jbquBmS6vERAfA_aem_2ITWKVWZzOfuW0hAJV5Rhw#Sec1"&gt; Nature Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ayala-Orozco said: ‘These molecules are simple dyes that people have been using for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They’re biocompatible, stable in water and very good at attaching themselves to the fatty outer lining of cells. But even though they were being used for imaging, people did not know how to activate these as plasmons.’&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After struggling for years to make blue-light-activated motors work against mouse tumors, Ayala-Orozco turned to explore completely different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I started to think that maybe what I needed was not necessarily a motor, but a molecule that absorbs near-infrared light, in the hopes that this molecule could be activated and could move in a different way — not necessarily by rotation,' he told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healio.com/news/hematology-oncology/20240208/molecular-jackhammers-show-potential-to-kill-cancer-cells-within-minutes"&gt;Healio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘That’s when I started thinking about some molecules called cyanines and started connecting the dots with a property from photophysics called plasmons, which I studied during my PhD to treat cancer. They are activated by near-infrared light. At some point, I decided I had to try this.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The next step will be determining whether this same molecular jackhammer will destroy cancer cells in humans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the estimated cancer diagnoses for 2025 by cancer type. Breast, prostate, and lung cancers are expected to be the most common cancers this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When researchers turned their microscopes on other cancer types, they made an exciting discovery: the molecular jackhammers proved just as devastating against prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer cells in petri dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘No matter which line, we are able to eliminate 100 percent on cell culture,’ Ayala-Orozco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The university will need to partner with a private company to scale up, overcome regulatory hurdles, and enter human trials, ‘hopefully, within 5 to 7 years,’ Ayala-Orozco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 19:59:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOVUFZUHVUQ2pQeDdSQnBjRFhNZmFlZ3FpTkE0TmVzTnBDVmNPLTk0TlZpbGpad0pwZHJ4eHZ2Mlh6Z0Rtcl9zdHY5aVdvbDFTVHlTNEktX29XYUVzY1gzQnY0bFBTc29FOW5qWkxXcGFtSWh1Ujh3cGVMajZFb2E4SzRpZkFscEJnNGtoOVJ6cW4yUHp4ZVlKeEhROXhBUEg3cVB4VGt2bHRxTjVyMlHSAbMBQVVfeXFMTkNIZDZkb3drdjA4NnZkMm1LdU56RDhtTUJfWmpjOFRmU1ZOMElYMlBCdDNCX2JKeVl1UFV6N1hXTWlkclJNb1JwQThNTmVYaGdIVVh1RThBbWxsaVFuQmNKTzJuVFdoVEZqYUFDWGYyZlZGNnBzVG56VVk5Uklnbzh1c09JV2xlQ0VpUnBSNDZCb2gxR3lKc1NrWnBGdDBLUE1OQlNCZm1GSVdBM0MzU3dzZzg</guid></item><item><title>睡觉时腿部感到焦躁不安？这种情况可能是罪魁祸首- CNN | Feeling antsy in your legs at bedtime?

            Karla Dzienkowski’s daughter was 11 when she started coming into her mom’s room at night saying she couldn’t fall asleep because of a stabbing feeling in her legs. She had to walk to make it stop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh300083b6mx5mf2hw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The preteen became cranky and tired. Her grades started to slip, and she even fell asleep on a bench during a family trip to an amusement park, Dzienkowski said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh300093b6mt0k4o3wa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It took three years, but Dzienkowski’s family finally got an explanation for the girl’s condition: restless legs syndrome.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000a3b6mmmt23kow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One study &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4634567/" target="_blank"&gt;estimates 4% to 29%&lt;/a&gt; of adults in Western industrialized countries have restless legs syndrome. It is a condition that too few people can recognize in themselves, and many doctors don’t know how to manage properly, said Dzienkowski, a nurse who is executive director of the &lt;a href="https://www.rls.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000b3b6m84spvi73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here is what experts want you to know about restless legs syndrome.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000c3b6matggznnr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Restless legs syndrome is a neurological disorder that is characterized by a need to move that is oftentimes associated with an uncomfortable feeling,” said Dr. John Winkelman, chief of the sleep disorders clinical research program at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000d3b6mrhot2gx6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The uncomfortable feeling — described as crawling, aching, tingling or throbbing — is often in the legs and sometimes the arms, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000e3b6m6c316hhu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Restlessness frequently happens when people with the condition are sitting or lying down, and it is relieved with movement, Winkelman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000f3b6mn7db6srf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Symptoms are more likely to occur when a person is at rest, most often at night, and because the syndrome interferes with sleep, it is classified as a sleep disorder, Winkelman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000g3b6m33e49pyd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In moderate to severe cases, people experience restless legs syndrome several times a week, and in the most extreme cases, symptoms can delay sleep for several hours, said Dr. Brian Koo, associate professor of neurology at Yale School of Medicine and director of the Yale Center for Restless Legs Syndrome.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000h3b6m6n328n1f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two strong components play a role in who gets restless legs syndrome: genetics and iron levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000i3b6mw03j9m6q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Restless legs syndrome often runs in families, and genetic markers make up about 20% of the prediction of who will get it, Winkelman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000j3b6min46o9w1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those with an iron deficiency are also more likely to get restless legs syndrome, including people who are pregnant, on dialysis, who are menstruating, who have anemia, or who are vegetarians, Winkelman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000k3b6mli45roro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants may also be vulnerable to restless legs syndrome, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000l3b6mvslzs6lb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The condition is twice as common in women as in men and much more common as people get older, Winkelman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000m3b6m0xwl1jdy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, as Dzienkowski learned, children can have restless legs syndrome, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000n3b6mnj5fb3bz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To treat restless legs syndrome, a good first step is to look at what might be making the condition worse, Winkelman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000o3b6m54virq30@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Alcohol, other medications and simple sugars may contribute to symptoms, Koo said.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000p3b6mx6r39dyl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If iron is low — or even borderline low — oral iron supplements or intravenous iron infusions may help, Winkelman added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000q3b6m1mca6skv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dzienkowski also recommends having a “bag of tricks” to manage symptoms, such as hot or cold packs, massages, walks or some mind-stimulating activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000r3b6mirzkwupz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For some reason … if you keep your mind engaged, it helps to keep symptoms at bay,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000s3b6m0clqgv97@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are medications that help if lifestyle changes and iron supplementation don’t work.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000t3b6mal9fjiv4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many doctors will start with a class of drugs called alpha2-delta ligands, such as gabapentin or pregabalin, Koo said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000u3b6mtsrlmj8g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For a long time, dopamine agonists were the first line of medications. But they are now prescribed infrequently because they can worsen restless legs syndrome over time, Winkelman added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000v3b6mklxla3o0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The medications for the most severe cases are low-dose, long-acting opioid medications, Koo said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If you have discomfort that motivates you to move your legs at rest — particularly if doing so disturbs your sleep — talk to a doctor, Dzienkowski said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000x3b6mg5jqqlqa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not all medical professionals are well versed in restless legs syndrome, so asking for a referral to a sleep specialist may be helpful, she said. You should also get your lab work done, especially an iron panel with ferritin, a blood test that looks at how much iron your body has and how available it is for use, Dzienkowski said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The sooner you do it, the better, because you’re just delaying diagnosis and treatment, which can be detrimental to your life,” she said. “You don’t realize that that sleepiness that you’re feeling at work or the crankiness or you’re not wanting to get out and do things could be the RLS bleeding into your daytime. …  At least go have that conversation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Bill Nye, the science educator who’s been a TV mainstay for decades, is not the kind of guy you’d expect would be friends with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the most prominent anti-science kook in the country. But apparently they go way back. And Nye is getting sick of all the texts he’s getting from Kennedy spouting absolute garbage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nye met Kennedy “many years ago,” according to a new profile of The Science Guy in &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a64929773/bill-nye-interview/"&gt;Men’s Health&lt;/a&gt; magazine, after the two men were introduced by actor Ed Begley Jr. to talk about environmental issues. Nye told the magazine that Kennedy, who’s now the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, sends him endless texts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Just no self-awareness,” Nye said of Kennedy. “And if you read these articles he sent, they’re all this speculation about autism and just cause-and-effect, and mercury in vaccines, that &lt;em data-node-id="10.1"&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; there’s a connection.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Kennedy has long been an anti-vaccine extremist, working from 2015-2023 as chair of the Children’s Health Defense. The health secretary has previously said “there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” and has worked to limit access to vaccines, risking the lives of millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nye told Men’s Health that he responded to the texts by saying he’d read Kennedy’s book, though it’s not clear which one. Kennedy has contributed to quite a few anti-science screeds, including books like &lt;em&gt;Vax-Unvax: Let the Science Speak&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Wuhan Cover-Up&lt;/em&gt;, and 2021’s &lt;em&gt;The Real Anthony Fauci&lt;/em&gt;. That last one includes a section where Kennedy promotes “miasma theory” and rejects germ theory. Miasma theory was abandoned in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory"&gt;19th century&lt;/a&gt;, while the germ theory of disease is foundational to our 21st-century understanding of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease"&gt;how diseases spread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nye told the magazine that after he got “miles and miles” of texts from Kennedy, he finally said, “Okay, no more texts,” concluding Kennedy simply wasn’t suited for the job he’s holding in the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Kennedy is a dangerous lunatic who doesn’t even believe in germ theory. But he’s going to do a lot of damage before he leaves his job. And it’s already happening. Kennedy’s so-called Make America Healthy Again commission issued a report last month that was riddled with errors and cited studies that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-make-america-healthy-again-report-cites-fake-studies-2000608850"&gt;don’t exist&lt;/a&gt;. And earlier this week, Kennedy fired all &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-purges-cdcs-vital-vaccine-advisory-committee-2000613732"&gt;17 members&lt;/a&gt; of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Those are the folks who help steer the country’s vaccine policies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FDA under Kennedy is also reportedly using AI to help &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/after-slashing-thousands-of-jobs-trumps-fda-wants-to-use-ai-to-approve-new-drugs-more-quickly-2000614144"&gt;approve new drugs&lt;/a&gt;, something that boggles the mind when you remember just how unreliable AI can be. Kennedy has repeatedly touted “&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-touts-spirituality-as-fix-for-americas-health-problems-2000565002"&gt;spirituality&lt;/a&gt;” as a fix to America’s health crisis, something Trump’s new pick to be Surgeon General has emphasized &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/maga-crackpots-turn-on-trumps-crackpot-surgeon-general-nominee-2000599701"&gt;as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Kennedy has long claimed that vaccines cause autism, and promised during a White House event &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/secretary-brain-worm-rfk-jr-tells-trump-well-know-the-cause-of-autism-by-fall-2000587763"&gt;back in April&lt;/a&gt; that he would reveal the “cause” of autism by the fall. Science doesn’t work with that kind of certainty or timetable, announcing the cause of a given disease like you’re unveiling a new Star Wars show before the holidays. But we’re not dealing with serious people, as Trump has taken charge, booting scientific experts in favor of the weirdest people on the planet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Science Guy may try to be diplomatic when it comes to his old friend, “Bobby” Kennedy, as he calls him in the new Men’s Health article. But when even your friends are saying you don’t have “good judgment” in national magazines, something is way off.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In October 2012, one of the largest and most destructive storms to emerge from the Atlantic devastated the US and Caribbean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy"&gt;Hurricane Sandy&lt;/a&gt; left deep scars in affected communities, including the loss of more than 250 lives, tens of billions of dollars in damage, and the less tangible – but still potent – effects of stress, grief, and trauma among survivors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research suggests the hurricane even affected the unborn children of parents who were pregnant when the superstorm hit. And for those who experienced extreme heat as well as storm stress, the effects may have been compounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;To our knowledge, no prior work has examined how exposure to multiple climate-related stressors during pregnancy might work together to shape children's developing brains," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/being-pregnant-during-extreme-weather-might-affect-how-bubs-brain-develops"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Donato Delngeniis, a neuropsychologist from Queens College in the US who led the investigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While hurricanes are a regular feature of the Atlantic Ocean weather system, ongoing human emissions of greenhouse gases are changing the climate in ways that &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/every-2024-atlantic-hurricane-had-faster-winds-because-of-climate-change/"&gt;intensify hurricane wind speeds&lt;/a&gt;, and exacerbate storm surges – like those that flooded New York City during the hurricane – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22838-1"&gt;by raising sea levels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164293" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937.jpg" alt="aerial photo of an american suburban neighbourhood destroyed by the storm. many grey-roofed houses are askew and destroyed, streets flooded with mud, a few people visible in the bottom left" class="size-full wp-image-164293" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937.jpg 3000w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164293" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The devastation of Hurricane Sandy goes beyond physical damage.

This part of the brain coordinates deliberate movement, procedural and conditional learning, habit formation, cognition, and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleven of the kids in this study were in-utero when Hurricane Sandy made landfall in New York, with flood, winds, and ensuing electrical damage destroying homes. The rest were womb-bound either side of the storm, but not during its onslaught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those children who had been exposed to the hurricane in-utero had significantly larger volume in a number of basal ganglia regions, including the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putamen"&gt;putamen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_pallidus"&gt;globus pallidus&lt;/a&gt;, which are involved in regulating movement, and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudate_nucleus"&gt;right caudate nucleus&lt;/a&gt;, which is associated with cognitive and motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;Despite never personally experiencing these climate events, we are seeing how climate change may be fundamentally altering children's brain development while they are still in the womb," Delngeniis &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/being-pregnant-during-extreme-weather-might-affect-how-bubs-brain-develops"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;The noticeable increase in children's brain volume could potentially lead to future behavioral disorders."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164294" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164294" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212.jpg" alt="portrait of a woman wearing a fur hood holding a hanky to her face as she walks through a damaged new york queens neighbourhood" class="size-full wp-image-164294" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212.jpg 3000w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164294" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;For weeks after Hurricane Sandy hit New York City, thousands went without power and heat, adding to the physical stress of the event.

This allowed the researchers to explore the added dimension of extreme heat exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the scans, extreme heat exposure on its own had no notable effect. But when paired with exposure to the hurricane, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation_(statistics)"&gt;statistical analysis&lt;/a&gt; revealed, extreme heat amplified the adverse effects of hurricane exposure on basal ganglia volume, creating "&lt;span&gt;profound disruptions to the children's developing brains," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/being-pregnant-during-extreme-weather-might-affect-how-bubs-brain-develops"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; behavioral neuroscientist Yoko Nomura, also from Queens College&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children exposed to both extreme heat and the hurricane tended to have a larger-than-usual left pallidum and a smaller-than-usual left &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens"&gt;nucleus accumbens&lt;/a&gt;, a structure which is considered &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.33588/rn.3009.99617"&gt;the interface between motivation and action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given the study's limited sample size and focus on large brain structures, further research would be needed to confirm the findings and determine whether specific stages of development or even sex may play a role in the outcome. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their implications are concerning in a world where &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hurricanes-really-are-getting-stronger-and-there-s-a-likely-human-fingerprint"&gt;extreme storms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/even-nasa-cant-explain-the-alarming-surge-in-global-heat-were-seeing"&gt;heat waves&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/places-on-earth-too-hot-for-humans-will-triple-this-century-scientists-warn"&gt;becoming commonplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These imaging methods enable us to observe how environmental stressors can cascade through a pregnant mother's experience to reshape the structure of a child's developing brain," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/being-pregnant-during-extreme-weather-might-affect-how-bubs-brain-develops"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Ahmed Duke Shereen from City University of New York. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our findings provide us with compelling evidence that the climate crisis is not merely an environmental crisis – it is a potentially neurological one with consequences for future generations who will inherit our planet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0324150"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's the first time a regulator &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/prac-concludes-eye-condition-naion-very-rare-side-effect-semaglutide-medicines-ozempic-rybelsus-wegovy" target="_blank"&gt;has confirmed the side effect&lt;/a&gt; following previous &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/17/healthy-returns-ozempic-faces-scrutiny-over-potential-eye-condition-risk.html"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; in Type 2 diabetes patients linking Ozempic to the condition, known as non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee has asked Novo Nordisk to add the eye condition as a side effect of "very rare" frequency in the product information for drugs that contain semaglutide. That's the active ingredient in Wegovy, Ozempic and Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the latest potential concern about popular GLP-1s such as Ozempic and Wegovy, which mimic gut hormones to regulate blood sugar and tamp down appetite. Demand for the drug class has soared despite hefty price tags and a handful of unpleasant side effects that are most commonly gastrointestinal, such as nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It likely won't be a big concern for the vast majority of patients: the eye condition may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people taking semaglutide for at least one year, according to the committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee said people with diabetes who are exposed to semaglutide are at a twofold increase in the risk of developing NAION compared with those not taking it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eye condition is the second-most common cause of blindness due to optic nerve damage, after glaucoma. It is characterized by vision loss due to decreased blood flow to the front part of the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain. The disease typically occurs without any pain and most commonly affects people ages 50 and above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee said patients should stop treatment with semaglutide products if they experience the side effect. Since December, it has been reviewing &lt;a href="https://laegemiddelstyrelsen.dk/en/news/2024/suspicion-of-rare-eye-condition-from-ozempic-use-to-be-investigated-further/" target="_blank"&gt;the findings&lt;/a&gt; of two Danish &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.09.24318574v1.full.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; linking Ozempic to the condition in diabetes patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Novo Nordisk said it has concluded that the data "did not suggest a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between semaglutide and NAION." The company said the benefits of semaglutide still outweigh its risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the drugmaker said it will collaborate with the EMA to update the labels for semaglutide products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day before the committee's statement, GLP-1s faced scrutiny over another potential eye-related side effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2834964?guestAccessKey=6090e38f-93ad-448f-aaff-ef4768286c5d&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;amp;utm_term=060525" target="_blank"&gt;published &lt;/a&gt;Thursday in JAMA Ophthalmology and conducted by University of Toronto researchers, found that diabetes patients who use GLP-1 drugs were twice as likely to develop neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) compared to those who don't take the medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the longer patients were treated with these medications, the greater their risk of developing nAMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;nAMD, commonly known as "wet" AMD, is the less common but more aggressive form of age-related macular degeneration. It is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss among older adults in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers drew on health records from Ontario, Canada. They analyzed nearly 140,000 adults with Type 2 diabetes to investigate a possible link between GLP-1 use and wet AMD. In the vast majority of cases, patients received semaglutide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk said semaglutide's "efficacy and safety have been extensively demonstrated in people with obesity/overweight with robust evidence for improving health outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at &lt;a href="http://nbcuni.com/?__source=newsletter%7Chealthyreturns" target="_blank"&gt;annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Latest in health-care tech: Here are the health tech companies that made CNBC's Disruptor 50 List&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/2025-cnbc-disruptor-50-see-the-full-list-of-companies.html"&gt;2025 CNBC Disruptor 50&lt;/a&gt; list is here, and a number of health tech startups including Transcarent, Abridge and Rad AI made the cut this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Disruptor 50 designation is a ranked list of innovative private companies that are advancing breakthrough technology within their sector. Any private, independently owned startups that were founded after Jan. 1, 2010 were able to be nominated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nominated companies had to submit qualitative information, like descriptions of their core business model, which were assessed by a team of CNBC editorial staff. They also had to submit quantitative data, like sales and user numbers, which were evaluated by CNBC's Disruptor 50 Advisory Board and Disruptor 50 VC Advisory Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the health tech companies that earned a spot this year:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#14: Transcarent.&lt;/strong&gt; Founded by longtime health-care executive Glen Tullman in 2020, Transcarent helps workers quickly access care and navigate benefits. The company has raised $940 million in total funding at a $3 billion valuation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#17: Virta Health.&lt;/strong&gt; Sami Inkinen (CEO), Stephen Phinney and Jeff Volek founded Virta Health in 2014. The startup helps patients manage diabetes and obesity, and it has raised $364.5 million at a $2.1 billion valuation, according to PitchBook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#23: Oura.&lt;/strong&gt; This smart ring-maker has raised $200 million at a $5.2 billion valuation. The company was founded by Petteri Lahtela, Kari Kivelä and Markku Koskela and launched in 2013. The consumer and wearable technology company is now led by Tom Hale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#26: Iambic Therapeutics.&lt;/strong&gt; Founded by Tom Miller (CEO) and Fred Manby, Iambic Therapeutics uses artificial intelligence to accelerate the pace of drug discovery and development. The company launched in 2020 and has raised $220 million.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#37: Formation Bio.&lt;/strong&gt; Benjamine Liu (CEO) and Linhao Zhang founded Formation Bio in 2016. The company uses AI to accelerate the clinical development of promising drug candidates. It has raised $600 million at a $1.7 billion valuation, according to PitchBook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#41: Rad AI.&lt;/strong&gt; This startup uses generative AI to save radiologists time and enhance productivity. Doktor Gurson (CEO) and Jeff Chang founded the company in 2018. Rad AI has raised $143 million in funding at a $528 million valuation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#43: ElevateBio.&lt;/strong&gt; David Hallal, Vikas Sinha and Mitchell Finer founded the genetic medicines company ElevateBio in 2017. The company has raised $1.3 billion and is now led by Ger Brophy. ElevateBio is advancing treatments for cancer, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and other conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#47: Abridge.&lt;/strong&gt; This startup uses generative AI to automate the clinical documentation that doctors and nurses&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;handle. Founded by Dr. Shiv Rao (CEO) and Zack Lipton in 2018, Abridge has raised $462.5 million at a $2.7 billion valuation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, some of the major players in AI took the top five spots on this year's list. Anduril, an autonomous defense company, earned the first spot, followed by OpenAI, Databricks, Anthropic and the design platform Canva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these five companies have a combined valuation of just under $500 billion, which is more than the combined total valuation of almost every past Disruptor 50 list of the last 12 years. A sign of the times, no doubt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full Disruptor 50 List &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/2025-cnbc-disruptor-50-see-the-full-list-of-companies.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of geriatricians, neurologists, nutritionists and public health specialists affiliated with a host of institutions across China, working with a pair of colleagues from Australia, has found that of all the transportation modes older people can use to get from one place to another, bicycling appears to offer the most benefit in potentially reducing the chances of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;For their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835115" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, the group analyzed years of medical data in the UK Biobank as a way to spot possible differences in dementia rates for people who regularly engage in different types of travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior research has shown that both exercise and engaging in spatial navigation regularly (such as working as a taxi or ambulance driver) can help slow the onset of dementia. In this new study, the team working in China wondered which activities related to both exercise and spatial navigation might be most beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, the research team pulled &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+records/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health records&lt;/a&gt; for 479,723 people with an average age of approximately 56.5 years, who were reasonably healthy and showed no signs of dementia. They then tracked the health of each person over an ensuing 13-year timeline. As part of their tracking, they compared the rates of those who developed dementia with those who did not by typical mode of transportation (not including to and from work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In looking at the data, the researchers found that those people who regularly rode a bicycle for transportation had lower rates of dementia compared to those who walked, drove or took the bus. They also found that the same people retained more hippocampal volume and that the risk was less for all three types of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dementia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; included in the study—Alzheimer's, young-onset and late-onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traveling mainly by bicycle, or mixing it with another kind of transport, was a significant factor in retaining hippocampal volume. The team also found that people without the APOE ε4 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+variant/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene variant&lt;/a&gt; gained even more by traveling by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bicycle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bicycle&lt;/a&gt;, and that those with the variant gained some benefit, but not as much.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;A common sleep aid restores healthier sleep patterns and protects mice from the brain damage seen in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug, lemborexant, prevents the harmful buildup of an abnormal form of a protein called tau in the brain, reducing the inflammatory brain damage tau is known to cause in Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that lemborexant and other drugs that work in the same way could help treat or prevent the damage caused by tau in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, and some frontotemporal dementias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have known for a long time that sleep loss is a &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/poor-sleep-quality-alzheimers-disease-3278982/"&gt;risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for Alzheimer’s disease,” says senior author David M. Holtzman, a professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this new study, we have shown that lemborexant improves sleep and reduces abnormal tau, which appears to be a main driver of the neurological damage that we see in Alzheimer’s and several related disorders. We are hopeful this finding will lead to further studies of this sleep medication and the development of new therapeutics that may be more effective than current options either alone or in combination with other available treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The antibodies to amyloid that we now use to treat patients with early, mild Alzheimer’s dementia are helpful, but they don’t slow the disease down as much as we would like,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need ways to reduce the abnormal tau buildup and its accompanying inflammation, and this type of sleep aid is worth looking at further. We are interested in whether going after both amyloid and tau with a combination of therapies could be more effective at slowing or stopping the progression of this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holtzman and his team were among the first to identify the connection between &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/sleep-apnea-brain-changes-memory-loss-3280412-2/"&gt;poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and the buildup of proteins such as amyloid and tau. In past work studying mice genetically prone to amyloid and tau buildup characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease, they showed that sleep deprivation makes this buildup worse. Improving sleep in these mice with lemborexant appeared to be protective, the latest study showed, with less buildup of tau protein tangles and less nerve cell death associated with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protein tau accumulates in the brain in multiple neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s, and causes inflammation and the death of brain cells. Holtzman and his team—co-led by first author Samira Parhizkar, an instructor in neurology—tested lemborexant in part because it has effects in parts of the brain known to be affected by abnormal tau accumulation. It also does not impair motor coordination, which is a concern for people with dementia taking hypnotic sleep aids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemborexant is one of three sleep drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration that inhibit the effect of orexins, small proteins that regulate sleep, by acting as orexin receptor antagonists. Lemborexant blocks both orexin receptors (type 1 and type 2). Receptors are proteins on the cell surface that bind to other molecules and regulate cell activity. These receptors are known to play important roles in sleep-wake cycles and appetite, among other physiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical company Eisai provided lemborexant for these studies as part of a research collaboration with WashU Medicine focused on developing innovative treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mice genetically prone to harmful tau buildup, lemborexant reduced brain damage compared with control mice. For example, those receiving lemborexant showed 30% to 40% larger volume in the hippocampus—a part of the brain important for forming memories—compared with control mice and those receiving a different sleep drug, zolpidem, which belongs to a different class of drugs. Zolpidem increased sleep but had none of the protective effects against tau accumulation in the brain that were seen with lemborexant, suggesting that the type of sleep aid—orexin receptor antagonist—is key in producing the neuroprotective effects. The researchers also found that the beneficial effects were only seen in male mice, which they are still working to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal tau is important in maintaining the structure and function of neurons. When healthy, it carries a small number of chemical tags called phosphate groups. But when tau picks up too many of these chemical tags, it can clump together, leading to inflammation and nerve cell death. The authors found that by blocking orexin receptors, lemborexant prevents excess tags from being added to tau, helping tau maintain its healthy roles in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holtzman says his team is continuing to explore the reasons lemborexant treatment’s neuroprotective effects were seen only in male mice. He speculated that the sex discrepancy could be due to the observation that female mice with the same genetic predisposition to tau accumulation developed less-severe neurodegeneration compared with male mice. With less damage to begin with, potential beneficial effects of the drug could have been smaller and more difficult to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research appears in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01966-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for this work came from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the JPB Foundation, the Alzheimer’s Association, the Rainwater Foundation, and a COBRAS Feldman Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holtzman is an inventor on a patent licensed by Washington University to C2N Diagnostics on the therapeutic use of anti-tau antibodies. Holtzman cofounded and is on the scientific advisory board of C2N Diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

Let this be your reminder today to avoid fried food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acrylamide is created when refined sugars react with an amino acid called asparagine, which can be found in&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14082081/expert-reveals-type-coffee-thats-linked-cancer.html"&gt; coffee beans&lt;/a&gt;, potatoes, wheat, corn and rice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It forms when these foods are heated to around 248 F (120 C) or above - this is hotter than standard baking temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some studies on rodents have suggested the chemical can cause tumors to form in or on the breasts, skin and lungs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among the studies was a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0940299314001791"&gt;2015 paper&lt;/a&gt; that found rats exposed to high levels of acrylamide over two years had a higher likelihood of suffering tumors in the breasts and thyroids than those that did not receive it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But others have found little risk of the cancer from exposure to the chemical, including when the doses are relatively low. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies tracking diet in humans have been &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9858116/"&gt;equally inconclusive&lt;/a&gt;, with some suggesting an increased risk of cancer among those consuming more acrylamide-laced foods while others suggest it doesn't raise risk for the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Hector Perez, a bariatric surgeon at Renew Bariatrics in Mexico, told the Daily Mail that the current evidence does not support avoiding a cup of coffee because of this probable carcinogen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Acrylamide is a byproduct of roasting, and, yes, it's been linked to cancer in rodents at insanely high doses, but that doesn't make your morning cup a hazard,' he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'In fact, moderate coffee consumption is linked to lower risks of type 2 diabetes, liver disease and mortality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Coffee beans contain the amino acid that can react with refined sugar to form acrylamide (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'So, unless you're drowning your coffee in sugar and cream, the bigger health risk isn't acrylamide, it's fear-mongering around it.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At present, the FDA does not advise people to stop eating foods that may contain acrylamide because of the cancer risk, and says more research is needed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, it currently tells people to ensure they eat a balanced diet with low sugar consumption and plenty of fruits and vegetables.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, eating your veggies can still expose you to more acrylamide as scientists say foods that have taken on a darker hue from cooking tend to contain more of the chemical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Hyman - who appeared recently at a press briefing with the Trump administration, where he supported the announcement of the removal of artificial dyes from foods - raised the alarm over the potential threat on X, and also suggested ways to limit exposure to acrylamide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This included eating golden brown instead of dark toast, boiling and steaming foods instead of frying them and avoiding refrigerated potatoes, which contain more sugar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Hyman did not suggest that people should stop eating foods that could contain acrylamide, but instead said they should see his post as a 'warning' to consume fewer fried foods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The amount of the chemical found in foods varies greatly depending on the cooking time and temperature used, but experts say that fast and processed foods tend to be the biggest dietary sources because of the high heat used to prepare them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.myfoodresearch.com/uploads/8/4/8/5/84855864/_6__fr-2022-528_nahid.pdf"&gt;2021 Ethiopian study&lt;/a&gt;, it's estimated that potato chips contain the most acrylamide at around 211 to 3,500 micrograms per kilogram, alongside french fries, which contain 779 to 1,299 micrograms per kilogram.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The FDA has not set limits on how much acrylamide can be present in foods, but it has released guidance on how to reduce levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Europe, regulators have acknowledged the need to set an acrylamide exposure limit, but also have not taken action to date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But this substance is not new; it has long been popular in India and across south Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Is psyllium husk a miracle weight-loss substance? No. But there are benefits, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-psyllium-husk" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is psyllium husk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The outer covering of any seed is called a husk. Psyllium husk comes from the seed of &lt;em&gt;Plantago ovata&lt;/em&gt; plants, a type of shrub that &lt;a href="https://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=PLOV" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;grows&lt;/a&gt; in sandy deserts and steppes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the US, “it is best known as the active ingredient in over-the-counter laxatives like Metamucil”, says Beal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Psyllium husk can be consumed in pill or powder form. It can also be consumed whole, when is resembles tiny wood shavings. When combined with water, it creates a gloopy, gel-like substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-psyllium-husk" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are the benefits of psyllium husk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That gloopiness may not sound appealing, but it’s part of what makes the product useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Psyllium husk is a good source of soluble fiber, explains Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Soluble fiber – unlike &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/special-topic/soluble-vs-insoluble-fiber#:~:text=Soluble%20fiber%20is%20found%20in,bran%2C%20vegetables%20and%20whole%20grains." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which remains unchanged during digestion – attracts water during digestion and turns into a gel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This gel can soften stools and add bulk to them, which helps in the management of constipation and diarrhea, says Julia Zumpano, a registered dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic Center for Human Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2af3dcb7-dbf7-4f82-bc6d-5f42609b5773" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":12,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"What is okra water and is it good for your health?","elementId":"2af3dcb7-dbf7-4f82-bc6d-5f42609b5773","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/21/okra-water-health-benefits"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Additionally, Zumpano says, this gel can bind with the bile in your gut, which is composed of cholesterol, and remove it with the body’s waste, thus reducing the amount of cholesterol in your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Beal points to a 2018 meta-analysis in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30239559/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; which found 10-15g of psyllium husk a day significantly reduced LDL (or “bad” cholesterol) and total cholesterol in “healthy individuals and those with high cholesterol”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;By slowing the rate of glucose in the bloodstream, it can also help in blood sugar management, says Zumpano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Psyllium husk can also increase one’s overall consumption of fiber, a significant benefit given that only 5% of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6124841/#:~:text=Although%20adequate%20intake%20of%20all,consume%20recommended%20amounts%20of%20fiber." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; in the US and 9% of &lt;a href="https://www.fdf.org.uk/fdf/our-work/our-campaigns/action-on-fibre/#:~:text=Currently%20only%209%25%20of%20adults,in%20the%20UK%20population%20intake." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt; in the UK eat the recommended amount of 25-30g of fiber a day. Psyllium husk provides about 7g of fiber per tablespoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eating fiber in any form has many benefits, says Zumpano, including “slowing down digestion and increasing satiety, which are both benefits of weight-loss drugs”. (She is careful to add that fiber does not accomplish either of these outcomes to the extent GLP-1s can.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-18" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Caused by inherited mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, it affects about one in 300 people. Those with the syndrome face up to an 80% chance of developing colorectal cancer during their lifetime, along with increased risks for endometrial, ovarian, and other cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-ai-model-detects-more-than-170-types-of-cancer-with-97-8-accuracy/"&gt;Preventing these cancers&lt;/a&gt; remains a critical challenge for healthcare providers. One hopeful strategy lies in simple changes to the diet—specifically, the use of resistant starch. This unique type of fiber, found in slightly green bananas, oats, and pulses, isn’t digested in the small intestine. Instead, it travels to the large bowel, where it ferments and feeds the gut’s helpful bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fermentation process produces short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate, which scientists believe play a key role in suppressing tumor growth. Resistant starch may also shift how gut bacteria process bile acids, which can lead to fewer of the kinds that damage DNA and trigger cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This potential cancer-fighting effect drew attention in the &lt;a href="https://www.capp3.org/media/23851/capp2_protocol.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CAPP2 trial&lt;/a&gt;, a landmark study led by researchers at Newcastle and Leeds universities. Launched in 1999, the trial enrolled close to 1,000 people with Lynch syndrome, making it one of the largest studies of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Leaders of the CAPP trial (L-R) Profs Tim Bishop, Sir John Burn and John Mathers.

They took these daily for two years in a double-blind design, meaning neither they nor the researchers knew who received what. The main focus was on preventing &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/steam-heat-therapy-revolutionary-new-treatment-for-prostate-cancer/"&gt;bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt;, though researchers also tracked other cancers linked to the syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial results seemed underwhelming. The data showed no major differences in cancer rates between the groups during the trial’s early years. But existing epidemiological evidence hinted that aspirin’s cancer-preventing effects might take longer to appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That insight led to an extended follow-up phase, supported by cancer registries in England, Wales, and Finland. Some participants were tracked for up to 20 years. This long-term data offered a surprising twist: while resistant starch didn’t lower bowel cancer rates, it cut the risk of other Lynch-related cancers by more than 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest resistant starch may offer protection against cancers &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-swallowable-pill-tracks-gut-inflammation-in-real-time/"&gt;outside the colon&lt;/a&gt;, possibly by creating a healthier gut environment over time. For people with Lynch syndrome—and those treating them—this humble dietary fiber may become a powerful tool in the fight against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protective effects were particularly pronounced for upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, including esophageal, stomach, biliary tract, and pancreatic cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 463 participants who consumed resistant starch, only five cases of upper GI cancers were reported, compared to 21 cases in the 455 participants who received the placebo. This reduction—over 60% for these hard-to-diagnose and often &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-treatment-quadruples-survival-rate-for-people-with-aggressive-cancers/"&gt;fatal cancers&lt;/a&gt;—marks a significant advancement in cancer prevention for Lynch syndrome patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor John Mathers, a nutrition expert from &lt;a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Newcastle University&lt;/a&gt;, emphasized the importance of these findings. “We found that resistant starch reduces a range of cancers by over 60%. The effect was most obvious in the upper part of the gut. This is important as cancers of the upper GI tract are difficult to diagnose and often are not caught early on,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathers also highlighted the need for further research to understand the exact mechanisms, particularly the role of bile acid metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Comparison of cancer diagnoses identified from the CAPP2 database with those identified from the National Cancer Registry and Analysis System (NCRAS) for England plus its Welsh counterpart and the corresponding national records in Finland.

Participants who consumed aspirin experienced a 50% reduction in large bowel cancer risk. This evidence influenced the &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&lt;/a&gt; (NICE) to recommend aspirin for individuals at high genetic risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, resistant starch’s protective effects extended beyond aspirin’s scope, covering a broader range of cancers and demonstrating persistent benefits even a decade after supplementation ceased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistant starch’s versatility adds to its appeal. It can be incorporated into the diet naturally through foods like peas, beans, and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/mind-diet-cuts-dementia-risk-by-25-study-finds/"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; or consumed as a powdered supplement. Beyond its cancer-preventive properties, resistant starch provides fewer calories than regular starch, making it a health-conscious choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from CAPP2 also underscore the broader health benefits of dietary fiber. Past studies have linked high fiber intake with reduced risks of colorectal cancer, cardiometabolic diseases, and all-cause mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber’s protective role is attributed to its complex composition, which includes carbohydrates that resist small-bowel digestion and undergo fermentation in the large bowel. The production of short-chain fatty acids and alterations in gut microbiota are key mechanisms underpinning these health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Time to first colorectal cancer and time to first non-colorectal cancer Lynch syndrome cancer in all CAPP2 study participants followed up for 10 years and for 20 years in England, Finland, and Wales.

Professor Tim Bishop from the &lt;a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Leeds&lt;/a&gt; expressed optimism tempered with a call for replication. “The results are exciting, but the magnitude of the protective effect in the upper GI tract was unexpected, so further research is required to replicate these findings,” he stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This caution has led to the launch of the CaPP3 international trial, involving over 1,800 individuals with Lynch syndrome. This study aims to determine whether lower doses of aspirin can provide similar protective effects while minimizing potential side effects. As the scientific community builds on these findings, resistant starch emerges as a simple yet powerful tool in cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="resistant_starches_and_their_benefits"&gt;Resistant Starches and Their Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other benefits of resistant starch include the following, according to &lt;a href="https://hopkinsdiabetesinfo.org/what-is-resistant-starch/"&gt;Johns Hopkins&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph list css-26i8l3" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/list" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;li class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-3e5pyk"&gt;An increased feeling of fullness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-3e5pyk"&gt;The treatment and prevention of constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-3e5pyk"&gt;A decrease in cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-3e5pyk"&gt;A lower risk of colon cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-3e5pyk"&gt;Causing less gas than other fibers, because resistant starch is fermented slowly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;A trial in people at high risk of hereditary cancers has shown a major preventive effect from resistant starch, which is found in foods such as oats, breakfast cereal, cooked and cooled pasta or rice, peas, beans, and slightly green bananas.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="19" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqz8jnc00173b77bitbansi@published"&gt;There are times when I will come home to find my girlfriend, “Bethany,” drunk and wanting to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;




  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqzbkz9002l3b77wkmn51dz@published"&gt;I, however, don’t feel comfortable doing this, as I believe someone who is intoxicated isn’t in a position to give consent, even with a partner. My refusals don’t sit well with her; she gets loud and belligerent before finally going to sleep it off. When she wakes up, she claims to have no memory of what occurred. Bethany doesn’t get loaded that often (only three to four times a month), but my patience with this behavior is running dry. Is this problem serious enough to warrant my demanding that she get some help?&lt;/p&gt;

They’re also within their rights to tell you to pack their bags, or to pack their own, and end the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqz8jum001b3b77iaf64ltg@published"&gt;That said, people who wake up three to four times per month with no recollection of their behavior while drunk are often resistant to changing this habit. And, generally, demands aren’t the most diplomatic way to go. So if you’re hoping to preserve the relationship and encourage Bethany to consider her relationship with alcohol, you’ll want to take a more gentle approach. Let her know what effect her drinking has on you. Tell her the situation is jeopardizing your relationship and shared living situation. Ask her whether she’s open to shifting her behavior. Then listen, and go from there.&lt;/p&gt;

This approach was led by Yuxuan Wang, an assistant professor of oncology at the &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-test-for-early-cancer-detection"&gt;Blood test for early cancer detection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed blood samples collected from individuals who had no visible signs of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-is-the-next-frontier-in-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;. They discovered that certain tumor-related markers showed up in the bloodstream far in advance of a cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Three years earlier provides time for intervention. The tumors are likely to be much less advanced and more likely to be curable,” noted Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts used sensitive methods to spot changes in DNA, which is genetic material found in every cell. When tumors form, small pieces of this DNA can enter the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding such fragments takes advanced technology and careful analysis. Detecting them early may allow for better outcomes and more personalized care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-cancer-clues-in-blood-samples"&gt;Early cancer clues in blood samples&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used stored blood samples from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/atherosclerosis-risk-communities-aric-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ARIC&lt;/a&gt;) study, which has been running since the 1980s. This long-term study follows thousands of people to understand the causes of heart and vascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By going back to samples collected over three years before diagnosis, the researchers could look at real-world cases where cancer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-scientist-discovers-that-common-non-cancer-drugs-when-combined-can-kill-cancer-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; naturally over time. That makes their findings stronger because they didn’t rely on artificial lab conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-test-detects-cancer-before-symptoms"&gt;Blood test detects cancer before symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many tests only catch disease once symptoms are obvious. The study highlights a potential window of opportunity that could shift how doctors monitor at-risk individuals. Armed with this type of blood-based detection, it might be possible to begin treatments much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows the promise of &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/screening/multi-cancer-early-detection-tests.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MCED tests&lt;/a&gt; in detecting cancers very early, and sets the benchmark sensitivities required for their success,” said Bert Vogelstein, co-director of the Ludwig Center at Johns Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations such as the &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/research-context-detecting-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; have supported investigations into early detection methods for several years. These efforts have broad implications for public health. When disease is found at an early stage, there is a greater possibility of simpler treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-detection-helps-treat-cancer"&gt;Early detection helps treat cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early identification often makes treatment easier. Targeted therapies or less aggressive interventions could become more common when irregular cells are discovered before they have time to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors may combine the blood-based tests with imaging or other types of health screening. This layered approach could lead to new pathways in cancer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/aspirin-may-prevent-cancer-from-moving-to-other-parts-of-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;care&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still refining how best to merge these methods without causing undue stress for patients or increasing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-regular-blood-testing-could-save-lives"&gt;Regular blood testing could save lives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often visit their doctors only when something feels wrong. But these findings suggest that regular blood testing, even when you feel healthy, could help catch issues before they turn serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these tests become part of routine care, doctors may one day use them the same way they check blood pressure or cholesterol. That could reshape how annual physicals are done and who gets referred for further screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-test-may-detect-more-than-cancer"&gt;Blood test may detect more than cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this study focused on cancer, the strategy of using blood samples to track emerging health concerns has broader potential. Other diseases may also produce telltale signals that show up early in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts believe this framework could improve how doctors handle chronic illnesses. If medical teams can identify trouble before any clinical signs appear, there might be more room for preventive measures. Large-scale trials remain essential to show where these strategies fit best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-and-next-steps"&gt;Challenges and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain laboratories already test blood samples for tumor-related genetic hints, but refining accuracy takes time. False positives and unnecessary procedures are a concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers continue to work on standards to ensure these screening tools are both reliable and accessible to the wider population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gathering diverse data is key. Different cancers have different markers, and not all forms of the disease release the same patterns of DNA into the bloodstream. Ongoing research should show where these blood tests work well and where they do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-future-research"&gt;What this means for future research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists now have a clearer idea of the mutation levels that need to be detected for blood tests to catch cancer early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some samples showed the same DNA changes as later ones, but at levels up to 79 times lower. That gives labs a benchmark to improve test sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights could guide how future trials are designed. Studies might focus on high-risk groups, testing intervals, or ways to combine blood tests with other markers like protein changes or immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-abstract/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-25-0375/762609/Detection-of-cancers-three-years-prior-to?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cancer Discovery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 14:21:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOUHdaeHBNNmREVVdHMlFzZ2hpWDNtcmVXLXF6SDZBWlV5T28yNW1sR2JNdHJiZzB6ZHZQQlJNV0xZeGtNWTFEZUxpT3kwNjUtNWJoR1ljY01TTDVQb2QzM0xlcXRpbFBFNXBzWk9lUGlfSzhOMDJRT0sxQUwybGROUXJRd1NxQjQtaXhJ</guid></item><item><title>根据研究，争吵很多的奇怪原因夫妇往往会更快地增加体重- YourTango | The Odd Reason Couples Who Argue A Lot Tend To Gain Weight Faster, According To Research - YourTango</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPQWVGajlPZHExUmZFSzRJVklMdFFYejl6eldsenpGRmk0d1dhX0M1Z1FUdldwcWFpVG5xUThIWmRiUDQ4NUZfRzZIZlFTVnd4YkhVYy1HcW45UEZMQjNmNklUOEpQSEM3VmZyTG5iWnBtMXp3NUk0ZGdQaE9heUw4Mi0wNnZJUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever I hear of a couple that claims they don't argue, I'm immediately suspicious. No relationship, whether it's a friendship, marriage, or even a friend-with-benefits thing, can escape the occasional argument about something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also totally healthy to argue from time to time; far healthier than keeping it in and letting it stew. While this is true, there is such a thing as arguing too much, and doing so can affect not just your relationship but also your waistline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;According to research, couples who argue a lot tend to gain faster than couples who don't.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/odd-reason-couples-argue-a-lot-gain-weight-faster.png" alt="couple who argue a lot" title="the odd reason couples who argue a lot tend to gain weight faster" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Drazen Zigic / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2802980/how-arguing-spouse-make-fat-marital-rows-depression-lead-fewer-calories-burned-meals.html"&gt;A 2014 study found&lt;/a&gt; that your excess arguing could be making you overweight. This is especially true for those &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/common-reasons-strongest-people-struggle-depression-anxiety"&gt;persons who suffer from depression&lt;/a&gt; or any type of mood disorder. The problem is that huge blowout arguments affect how high-fat foods are processed in the body and result in fewer calories being burned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/tiny-rules-separate-couples-who-fight-those-who-dont"&gt;4 Tiny Rules That Separate Couples Who Fight And Those Who Don't&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In marriages where fighting was just a constant theme, those couples burned, on average, 31 fewer calories an hour than those who were in a marriage where arguing wasn't as frequent. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One would think that getting fired up and shaking your hand wildly at your spouse while you try to prove your point would help you burn calories, but no such luck. Sorry, you guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 43 healthy couples who had been married for at least three years. After they were given questionnaires about their marriage, depression, and mood disorders, they were given a pretty hearty meal totaling 930 calories and 60 grams of fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/psychological-reason-so-many-couples-fight-about-dishwasher"&gt;The Psychological Reason Why So Many Couples Fight About The Dishwasher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, roughly two hours after their meal, the couples were asked to discuss topics given to them by the researchers that were specifically chosen to really &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/top-issues-couples-fight-about-least-most-common"&gt;get each partner ticked off and yelling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next several hours, the couples were continually tested via their blood and breathing.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqkqe0000gsnksf7beuaol@published"&gt;For over a year, I walked around feeling like my head was underwater. Tasks blurred together; it took longer to think of words. I struggled to follow conversations, and as a result experienced social anxiety for the first time in my life. On bad days, even reading a single sentence required a painful level of focus. I started calling it “brain fog,” though the term felt frustratingly vague, more of a symptom than a diagnosis. Was it just my mental health? Burnout? I’d had COVID—was it from that?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlb3r000o3577r8gll6kl@published"&gt;I tried everything: sleep, stretching, meditation, medication. I got blood panels to make sure I was healthy. The doctors I saw looked at me with a shrug. The gist was: &lt;em&gt;We can run more tests if you want, but everything seems fine. It’s probably just anxiety. Try to relax.&lt;/em&gt; The fog always returned. I felt doomed.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlb8w000p3577qqm40e1y@published"&gt;Then I came across a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9845100/"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; in Bioelectronic Medicine, in which researchers gave nicotine patches, the same ones that smokers use to quit cigarettes, to four long-COVID patients for up to a week. Their cognitive symptoms—things like poor concentration and memory issues—improved dramatically, according to patient surveys. The study was tiny and far from conclusive, but I was desperate and willing to give anything a try.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbe7000q3577yfk51wp7@published"&gt;The patch seemed like a big leap, though. At 7 milligrams of nicotine, it felt like too much for me. I’ve never smoked a cigarette or vaped in my life, so this would be my introduction to the substance. I was also worried about the nausea that some people experience with the patches. So I picked up the lowest-dose nicotine gum I could find: 2 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="148" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbkd000r3577qkeb2h0e@published"&gt;That afternoon, I chewed a piece, feeling a bit ridiculous. I was skeptical that this potential fix would be any different from everything else I’d tried (that is, a bust). But within an hour, something had clicked. The fog didn’t lift entirely, but my brain felt like it had come back online in a way it hadn’t in months. Now, I keep a pack of gum on my desk and another in my bag, just in case. Most mornings, I pop a piece while I’m answering emails or getting ready to write. I take another before social events. Two months in, I still chew one or two pieces a day, and the symptoms have mostly stayed away. Every few weeks I can feel a hint of brain fog creeping back in, but it’s nothing like before. My concentration has skyrocketed. I feel like I have my life back.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbnh000s3577yo5szlmw@published"&gt;To be very clear: Anyone taking nicotine to treat brain fog (like me) is still very much experimenting. There are no protocols or prescribed doses approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The evidence for nicotine’s use in otherwise-healthy people with mild cognitive issues is limited to early studies and &lt;a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/nicotine-patches-for-long-covid/?pg=2"&gt;anecdotal accounts across long-COVID forums&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that for some people, it might help. There is more research on how nicotine may help people with some cognitive disorders, though this, too, is something scientists are still exploring. Overall, it might be accurate to say that nicotine “holds promise” as a potential tool for brain functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="138" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbr8000t3577j7b168rl@published"&gt;Bear with me. You might be thinking, &lt;em&gt;Isn’t nicotine bad?&lt;/em&gt; The word carries decades of baggage, mostly thanks to Big Tobacco. And there’s no doubt cigarettes (and even vapes) are terrible for your health. But when divorced from cigarettes and delivered in controlled, slow-release doses, researchers say it can, in fact, be good. “We have found that nicotine patches are useful along a whole spectrum of impairments, like people with ADHD, Alzheimer’s, and people with age-related memory and cognitive impairment,” says &lt;a href="https://psychiatry.duke.edu/profile/edward-daniel-levin"&gt;Edward Levin&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University who studies the effects of nicotine. It has also been shown to help with &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2017/01/23/nicotine-normalizes-brain-deficits-key-schizophrenia"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4430096/"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6129985/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. However, Levin emphasized that all those uses for nicotine patches—anything other than quitting smoking—are still under investigation. He hopes scientists will know more in the “near future.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbvd000u35778d0i61ci@published"&gt;What we know now is that nicotine is a chemical compound that acts on receptors in the brain called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, or nAChRs. “The word we use is &lt;em&gt;modulate&lt;/em&gt;—so they modulate nerve cell–to–nerve cell transmission throughout the brain,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/ccm/person/paul-newhouse-md"&gt;Paul Newhouse&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology and the director of the Vanderbilt Center for Cognitive Medicine at Vanderbilt University. ”They have an important role in all sorts of human behaviors and cognitive functions.” Those receptors usually respond to acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in everything from muscle activation to attention. But nicotine can bind to and activate those receptors in much the same way as acetylcholine, essentially mimicking its effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="159" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbyb000v357769ym1vga@published"&gt;Nicotine’s role in facilitating attention is one of its most well-established functions. “We know that nicotine receptors are involved particularly in attention—so the ability to focus and maintain attention, all of that seems to have an important role for nicotinic signaling,” says Newhouse. “And attention is the front end of memory, right? So without attention, you can’t encode or remember anything.” That’s why it’s promising when it comes to conditions involving memory. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466669/"&gt;In 2012&lt;/a&gt;, Newhouse and Levin published a randomized controlled trial showing that short-term nicotine use improved cognitive performance in people with mild cognitive impairment. They’re now wrapping up a larger, &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.064697"&gt;multiyear follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; looking at the long-term effects of nicotine in this population, with results expected later this year.&lt;br&gt;While this kind of data could help build the case for therapeutic nicotine, doctors currently have no guidelines—and no FDA approval—to prescribe it for anything beyond smoking cessation, so many clinicians probably wouldn’t feel comfortable recommending it just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlc1a000w3577vncofv1j@published"&gt;The research on nicotine’s effects on long COVID is very new compared to other cognitive conditions, and there is yet to be a randomized controlled trial. But Marco Leitzke, who is a guest scientist at the Clinic and Polyclinic at the University of Leipzig in Germany and the researcher behind the initial nicotine and long-COVID study that I read, is optimistic about its potential. “Impaired nAChR function in the human body is the &lt;a href="https://bioelecmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42234-025-00167-8"&gt;first and only hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; that can logically explain and decipher every symptom of long COVID,” he says. Since publishing his findings, he’s continued researching dosing regimens and giving lectures to build awareness around the hypothesis that this is what’s happening with long COVID, and that nicotine can help. But to move from hypothesis to proven treatment, he says, the scientific community urgently needs double-blind, randomized, controlled trials—the gold standard for treatment research—on nicotine therapy for post-acute infection syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlc4z000x35770bpyq22l@published"&gt;Cigarettes and vapes are bad for your health because of what they do to your lungs, but that’s not the only difference between those vices and therapeutic nicotine. Compared to the near-instant delivery of a cigarette—where nicotine spikes in the brain within seconds—gum and patches release it far more gradually. “With the patch, it comes up to a plateau and stays there all day long,” says Levin. The gum—my delivery system of choice—is a little different, but it also doesn’t deliver the big hit that comes with puffing on a cigarette or a vaping device. “You have a very slow absorption, and it kind of comes to a peak, depending on how long you have it in your mouth, but it’ll gradually dissipate,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlc8j000y3577evrcjcu0@published"&gt;That slower absorption matters, not just for side effects, but for addiction risk. “Anything that you put in your body has a risk associated with it,” Levin says. “But I would say that the gum and the patches are at the very low end of the risk curve.” A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8183099/"&gt;2021 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; looked at 608 nonsmokers who were administered the patch and found that no one reported dependence. Still, nicotine isn’t side effect–free. The most common issues for nonsmokers include nausea, dizziness, or (in the case of patches) skin irritation. Many people who tried the patch to manage long-COVID symptoms have &lt;a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/nicotine-patches-for-long-covid/?pg=4"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in forums that they’ve had to stop because it caused vomiting. And nicotine isn’t safe for everyone; Levin specifically warns against use during pregnancy, nursing, and in children due to potential effects on brain development.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlcav000z3577mba903pk@published"&gt;There’s another important caveat: More isn’t always better. Over Zoom, Newhouse shows me a U-shaped graph. On the x-axis: dose. On the y-axis: performance. “If you’re not working at the optimal level, then stimulating nicotinic receptors will bring you up to here or closer to here.” He points to the top of the curve, where performance is peaking. That’s the ideal case.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlcdx00103577x8zdbf5k@published"&gt;If your brain is already working well, though, nicotine can have the &lt;em&gt;opposite &lt;/em&gt;effect. “If you’re right here at the top of the curve, functioning at a high level, if I flog your nicotinic receptors, you’re actually going to have a decline in performance,” he adds. I’ve noticed this in my own nicotine use—on days when I used the gum while already feeling clearheaded, I sometimes felt jittery, not sharper. That was rare, but it reminded me that there is the potential to overdo it.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlch6001135774mg7uy5q@published"&gt;So: An article on the internet, like this one, cannot tell you that nicotine is a proven therapy for brain fog, or anything else. But if you do try it, Levin recommends going “low and slow,” and working with a doctor. Newhouse says he regularly fields questions from patients curious about trying nicotine for early Alzheimer’s concerns, though he doesn’t have data on how many physicians are actually discussing it with their patients. Both he and Levin are skeptical that nicotine will ever gain FDA approval for cognitive impairment. There’s simply no financial incentive—nicotine is too cheap, too old, and too unsexy for drug companies to invest in. “If it turns out to work for certain kinds of cognitive problems, then it’s a pretty cheap and easy-to-access treatment,” says Newhouse. “But it’s not without its side effects and risks, too. I mean, there’s no free lunch.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlcjq00123577xnghv6si@published"&gt;For me, the uncertainty around nicotine feels like a small price to pay. The gum’s been working, so I haven’t bothered switching to patches. (Why mess with a good thing?) After a year of fog, I’m just glad to feel like myself &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Here are three signs yours may have &lt;span class="plus" data-ga-track="caption expand"&gt;... More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; already run its course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;getty&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2025 preregistered &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40111896/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40111896/" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40111896/"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt; analyzed data from over 10,000 participants across four national longitudinal studies. It found a clear pattern: relationship satisfaction doesn’t just drop suddenly at the end. Rather, it goes through a phase of “terminal decline.” This decline begins years before the actual breakup, with a slow preterminal dip, followed by a sharper crash months before separation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also discovered that relationship satisfaction declines more sharply than general life satisfaction. This pattern was more severe for partners who didn’t initiate the breakup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the research suggests a clear trajectory, most people don’t see the signs that they’re on it until it’s too late. They say things like, “I’m just overthinking it,” or “Maybe I’m just tired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been wondering whether you’re still choosing your relationship or just maintaining it out of habit, here are &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2025/02/24/4-subtle-relationship-patterns-that-lead-to-breakups-by-a-psychologist/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2025/02/24/4-subtle-relationship-patterns-that-lead-to-breakups-by-a-psychologist/" target="_self" aria-label="three signs"&gt;three signs&lt;/a&gt; you may already be in the pre-breakup phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. You Feel Relieved When You Imagine Life Without Them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fantasies of freedom often show up before a breakup — not because you want to hurt them, but because you want to feel like yourself again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You no longer imagine a future together, but instead find yourself daydreaming about a life you live on your own terms. You wonder how it would feel to wake up without the relationship weighing you down or managing the emotional strain that doesn’t seem to cease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, when the exhaustion sets in, you rarely notice how your body feels. You stop fighting because you no longer have the energy to keep trying. You don’t initiate conversations, try to repair what’s broken or mend the bond that seems to be crumbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/14/7/561" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/14/7/561" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/14/7/561"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Behavioral Sciences&lt;/em&gt; analyzed responses from 401 married couples and found that those with lower self-compassion, relationship self-efficacy and happiness reported significantly higher levels of couple burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapidly dwindling happiness emerged as the strongest predictor of burnout — even more than their income, how long they were married for or even the number of children they had together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicator matters because burnout doesn’t always show up as conflict. Often, it stems from a steady decline in emotional resources. When you are no longer happy in a relationship, you don’t feel enough self-compassion; as a result, the relationship begins to feel too heavy to shoulder. It’s not because your love is gone, but because your capacity to carry it is.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;2. You’re Exhausted All The Time And You Don’t Know Why&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re constantly making excuses, compensating or dwelling on all the times you could have said things but didn’t, your body begins to grieve before your mind catches up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means the emotional labor has started to outweigh the connection you’re trying so hard to maintain. Because at this point, you don’t even want to try and fix the broken parts. The only thing you care about is waking up feeling rested enough to go about your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2023 &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fare.12948" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fare.12948" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fare.12948"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Family Relations&lt;/em&gt; found that, for dual-earner couples, emotional exhaustion didn’t just stem from external stressors. It was often associated with how unevenly emotional labor was distributed within the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one partner, usually the woman, consistently took on more coping and regulation, they reported significantly higher fatigue. The reverse wasn’t true because men’s strategies didn’t buffer their partners in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This imbalance tends to grow gradually. Specifically, in the moments where you swallow what you want to say because peace matters to you more than being right does. You try to patch up the tension while putting on a calm face, while on the inside you feel anything but.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This emotional fatigue can also manifest as a physiological signature. A 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306453017311903" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306453017311903" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306453017311903"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Psychoneuroendocrinology&lt;/em&gt; tracked couples’ real-time stress and fatigue levels across five days. It found that after emotionally strained interactions, especially ones rated as negative, both partners reported feeling more tired — even when no arguments made it to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatigue, it turns out, doesn’t need a crisis to knock on the door. It shows up through repetition, and the body keeping score of every unresolved feeling you never had the chance to voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re tired of pretending everything is fine, especially when your body already knows it isn’t, it could be a sign that the relationship may be coming to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. You Keep Wondering If You Should Leave&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pre-breakup phase, you might find yourself ruminating on why you chose to stay with them in the first place. You start stacking good moments against the growing bad ones, and the future plans against their past mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-base embedly-align"&gt;&lt;fbs-embedly iframe-src="https://embedly.forbes.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FjCp2KG6r7wo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DjCp2KG6r7wo&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FjCp2KG6r7wo%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube"&gt;&lt;/fbs-embedly&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start feeling like you’re the only one in the relationship who keeps trying, feeling a little lonelier each day. There might not even be a glaring reason to leave; there simply aren’t enough good reasons to stay. And that absence will start to weigh on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days you may feel anchored, while, on others, you’re bombarded with a feeling that something fundamental isn’t working between you and your partner. And the tug-of-war in your head doesn’t stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2024 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38300552/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38300552/" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38300552/"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt; found that people who felt conflicted about their partner often experienced mental whiplash, where they went from wanting closeness to pulling away, from imagining a future together to feeling frustrated or numb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the participants in the study, this ambivalence gave rise to far more than just confusion. It shaped their daily behaviors in subtle but significant ways, from overthinking to emotional withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if the question keeps returning to you, “Should I just leave?” it’s no longer a question. It’s likely an answer you might be trying to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, one of the &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/08/03/a-psychologist-reveals-the-5-stages-of-uncoupling/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/08/03/a-psychologist-reveals-the-5-stages-of-uncoupling/" target="_self" aria-label="clearest signs that a relationship is ending"&gt;clearest signs that a relationship is ending&lt;/a&gt; isn’t what’s happening between you. Rather, it’s what’s no longer happening &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; you. And that’s the part individuals often notice last.&lt;/p&gt;

Arguably the most well-known of these chemical culprits are per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are used for stuff like non-stick surfaces on frying pans. They are also known as “&lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a42610916/what-are-pfas-forever-chemicals/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:forever chemicals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;forever chemicals&lt;/a&gt;” for their tendency to linger in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But this environmental scourge is only one of many similar substances.

MCCPs have been detected in the atmosphere on other continents (including Asia and even &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/news/a28607/antarctica-has-giant-ice-hole/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Antarctica;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;) but a new study from the University of Colorado Boulder claims that North America has now joined that unlucky list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In setting out to detect how aerosols form and grow in an agricultural region of Oklahoma, the team of scientists behind this recent study stumbled across trace amounts of MCCPs in the &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a64530001/curiosity-carbonates-mars/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:atmosphere;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;. They detected these particles using a technique known as nitrate ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry, and the results were published last week &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenvironau.5c00038" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in the journal ACS Environmental AU;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;in the journal &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;ACS Environmental AU&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;MCCPs start their lives within things like metalworking fluids, textiles, and PVC, which is why they can often find themselves in &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a25056200/purple-bacteria-waste-water-energy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wastewater;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wastewater&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a problem, because a fertilizer known as biosolids (which is made from treated sewar sludge) is often spread across agricultural crops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When sewage sludges are spread across the fields, those toxic compounds could be released into the air,” Daniel Katz, lead author of the study, &lt;a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/news/first-ever-airborne-toxin-detected-in-western-hemisphere" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said in a press statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said in a press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We can't show directly that that's happening, but we think it's a reasonable way that they could be winding up in the &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/design/a30768500/air-purifying-headphones-patent/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:air;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;. Sewage sludge fertilizers have been shown to release similar compounds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The creation of this synthetic chemical was in large part due to the regulation of its toxic cousin, Short Chain Chlorinated Paraffins (SCCPs), which have been regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (&lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a25702999/epa-mercury-coal-plant/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EPA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt;) and the Stockholm Convention (an international body formed in 2001 to protect human health against persistent organic pollutants). Earlier this year, the Stockholm Convention also marked MCCPs for global elimination. Who knows if this will spawn the creation of &lt;em&gt;another &lt;/em&gt;toxic chemical, but this regulatory game of whack-a-mole is similar in the truly Sisyphean task of &lt;a href="https://peer.org/commentary-epas-whack-a-mole-forever-chemicals-posture-is-an-intolerable-failure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:trying to eliminate PFAS from the environment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;trying to eliminate PFAS from the environment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We always have these unintended consequences of &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/airlines/news/a24221/wi-fi-calls-on-airplanes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:regulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;regulation&lt;/a&gt;, where you regulate something, and then there's still a need for the products that those were in,” Ellie Browne, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “So they get replaced by something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Luckily, there is some good news. The Oklahoma Senate passed a bill earlier this year &lt;a href="https://oksenate.gov/press-releases/senator-greens-bill-prohibiting-biosolids-fertilizer-passes-senate?back=%2Fnode#:~:text=2025%20%7C%2011%3A14am-,Senator%20Green's%20bill%20prohibiting%20biosolids%20as%20fertilizer%20passes%20Senate,the%20state%20Senate%20this%20week" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eliminating biosolids as a fertilizer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;eliminating biosolids as a fertilizer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a newly established environmental group called The Coalition for Sludge-Free Land aims to make the ban a national one (the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/biosolids" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EPA currently regulates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;EPA currently regulates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but doesn’t ban, the substance). Now that MCCPs have been found in the atmosphere, the UC Boulder team hopes that future efforts will be able to discern their &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/news/a28513/spike-in-airborne-radioactivity-detected-in-europe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:airborne;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;airborne&lt;/a&gt; impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We identified them, but we still don’t know exactly what they do when they are in the atmosphere, and they need to be investigated further,” Katz said in a press statement. “I think it’s important that we continue to have governmental agencies that are capable of evaluating the &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a64393667/purple-is-fake/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:science;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; and regulating these chemicals as necessary for public health and safety.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPTllmSzJrX3NqZTQ3eFZuV0lvVkdxM3pIckpPNHZILUZyem02TUtkajlUYURxOWpwSExHLXFxSzloRFNITFNGX3BwaHh4bEQtVWtoNkRqTkREajlzN3lNNndUN3lOLTR5LUxaQXRsRFJmOHhRWVR6c0FhOTJXaTAxaFhjcmQ4V2ZNZEVPVg</guid></item><item><title>以色列研究发现对乙酰氨基酚药物通过首先阻断神经疼痛起作用-以色列时报 | Israeli study finds acetaminophen drug works by first blocking pain in nerves - The Times of Israel</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOeFljczhaNngzVHRzTFQ0bGxOM3NtN0pqYmk4d2xxMUVNODR3UUFFUlRCemhfaEtFaGNubUN0RGJmMVVTZ3ExZmdmWGI5MnB2bDQ2RVdlV2t2blVuWW5udkFzWjNiYXp6MzZBZmdkU01pNFlCMURXTmNhVllsTkViUzg0YkJVcF9qNmd1WGZRSHgxQUJFbjBSbkV6bW1jb0N0bVpwbTJTY1NYOXp30gGyAUFVX3lxTE9wY08zcGRDeHp4QlVlRUJISnVjLV9xU04tUXFwV1JhRTNiMEdOeE91cE5KR0JoYkZDbVYxcVpLUTY2QmFjUmJ3TUpNR29tZ2lmZmRqUXlCTlJwRWtHYzVETzIzVERzblUzUHFEWjZYZi0yU0d2Uy1VeS05YmhNQ1UzZnhRMmt6emxFS3dmTmxaMUd2S1hNcmN2a0NaMURfc0VfS0JQOWl6OTZGUEV0NmtrcVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of Israel</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 12:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOeFljczhaNngzVHRzTFQ0bGxOM3NtN0pqYmk4d2xxMUVNODR3UUFFUlRCemhfaEtFaGNubUN0RGJmMVVTZ3ExZmdmWGI5MnB2bDQ2RVdlV2t2blVuWW5udkFzWjNiYXp6MzZBZmdkU01pNFlCMURXTmNhVllsTkViUzg0YkJVcF9qNmd1WGZRSHgxQUJFbjBSbkV6bW1jb0N0bVpwbTJTY1NYOXp30gGyAUFVX3lxTE9wY08zcGRDeHp4QlVlRUJISnVjLV9xU04tUXFwV1JhRTNiMEdOeE91cE5KR0JoYkZDbVYxcVpLUTY2QmFjUmJ3TUpNR29tZ2lmZmRqUXlCTlJwRWtHYzVETzIzVERzblUzUHFEWjZYZi0yU0d2Uy1VeS05YmhNQ1UzZnhRMmt6emxFS3dmTmxaMUd2S1hNcmN2a0NaMURfc0VfS0JQOWl6OTZGUEV0NmtrcVE</guid></item><item><title>胡子到底有多脏？这就是《科学》。- ScienceAlert | Just How Dirty Are Beards?

			&lt;p&gt;Beards have long attracted suspicion, sometimes seen as stylish, sometimes as unsanitary. But how dirty are they, really?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human skin is home to billions of microorganisms – mainly bacteria, but also fungi and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="164300" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; – and facial hair provides a unique environment for them to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro.2017.157"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that beards, in particular, support a dense and diverse microbial population, which has fuelled a persistent belief that they are inherently unhygienic. The Washington Post recently &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/14/beards-bacteria-toilets/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that some toilets contain fewer germs than the average beard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But are beards truly a hygiene risk? A closer look at the evidence reveals a nuanced picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microbial population on skin varies by location and is influenced by factors such as temperature, pH, humidity and nutrient availability. Beards create a warm, often moist environment where food debris and oils can accumulate – ideal conditions for microbial growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbes thrive not just because of the warm, moist conditions beards provide, but also because of constant exposure to new contaminants and microbes, especially from hands that frequently touch surfaces and the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns among scientists about beard hygiene date back over 50 years. Early &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC547091/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; showed that facial hair could retain bacteria and bacterial toxins even after washing. This led to the enduring idea that beards act as bacterial reservoirs and could pose an infection risk to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For healthcare workers, this has made beards a point of controversy, especially in hospitals where pathogen transmission is a concern. However, hospital-based research has shown mixed results. One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9542990/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that bearded healthcare workers had higher bacterial loads on their faces than clean-shaven colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00330-018-5648-z"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt;, looking at whether it would be hygienic to evaluate dogs and humans in the same  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="164300" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scanner, found that most men's beards contained significantly more microbes than dog fur, including a greater presence of harmful bacteria. The researchers concluded: "Dogs are no risk to humans if they use the same MRI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164309" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164309" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/dog_in_mri_642.jpg" alt="dog in an mri" class="wp-image-164309 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/dog_in_mri_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/dog_in_mri_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/dog_in_mri_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164309" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Which is less hygienic, a dog or your beard? (Zinkevych/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, other studies have challenged the idea that beards increase infection risk. For example, one investigation found &lt;a href="https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(14)00090-5/fulltext"&gt;no significant difference&lt;/a&gt; in bacterial colonisation between bearded and clean-shaven healthcare workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study also reported that bearded doctors were less likely to carry &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;, a major cause of hospital infections, and that there was no increase in infection rates among patients treated by bearded surgeons wearing surgical masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beards can sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/skin/beard-burn"&gt;spread skin infections&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://medicinetoday.com.au/dermatology-quiz/vesiculopustular-eruption-beard"&gt;impetigo&lt;/a&gt; – a contagious rash often caused by &lt;em&gt;S. aureus,&lt;/em&gt; which is commonly found in facial hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, parasites like pubic lice – which usually live in the groin area – can also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0365059619301783"&gt;show up&lt;/a&gt; in beards, eyebrows or eyelashes, particularly in cases of poor hygiene or close contact with an infected person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The case for good beard hygiene&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neglected beards can foster irritation, inflammation and infection. The skin beneath a beard – rich in blood vessels, nerve endings and immune cells – is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27212465/"&gt;highly sensitive&lt;/a&gt; to microbial and environmental stressors. When sebum, dead skin, food debris and pollutants accumulate, they can irritate the skin and provide fuel for &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/problems-caused-by-beards"&gt;fungal and bacterial growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC547091/"&gt;strongly recommend&lt;/a&gt; washing your beard and face every day. Doing so removes dirt, oils, allergens and dead skin, helping prevent microbial buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164310" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/beard_trim_642.jpg" alt="man getting his beard trimmed" class="wp-image-164310 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/beard_trim_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/beard_trim_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164310" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A well-trimmed, washed beard is no bacterial utopia.

These steps help maintain not only hygiene but also beard health and appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, are beards dirty? Like most things, it depends on how well you care for them. With daily hygiene and proper grooming, beards pose little risk and may even be healthier than we once thought.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256917/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

That’s not entirely surprising. Dietitians say that many people don’t know about the health benefits of eating seafood, or they may have concerns about the environmental impact and sustainability of commercial fishing.

Because they’re low on the food chain, they’re relatively low in mercury and other toxins (large predatory fish at the top of the food chain accumulate more contaminants). They’re high in protein and omega-3 fats. And they tend to be sustainable because they reproduce more rapidly than larger fish species, said Zeratsky at the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6XBCRAWIHBEHHIYGQH2UX22JDQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6XBCRAWIHBEHHIYGQH2UX22JDQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Rainbow trout&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LEJYN3Y2MZH2BPB3MY7K6YKONA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A single serving of rainbow trout contains more than an entire day’s worth of vitamin D and vitamin B12, as well as large amounts of omega-3 fats, protein and minerals. It has a mild flavor that makes it easy to use in a variety of dishes. It’s also a good choice for &lt;a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-basics/sustainable-healthy-fish/nutritious-rainbow-trout" target="_blank"&gt;environmental reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3NRH5EHAPNAWHC52UWPGPCOVF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And it’s relatively affordable. Just look for tinned rainbow trout and frozen rainbow trout fillets at your grocery store.

                        &lt;/div&gt;                                        &lt;p&gt;A 41-year-old London-based primary care doctor has claimed his biological age is 24, thanks to his comprehensive routine and supplement regimen. According to tests taken 18 months ago, Dr. Mohammed Enayat's biological age was 17 years younger than his chronological age. He used GlycanAge and TruAge PACE tests, which measure inflammation and epigenetics, to determine his biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, Dr. Enayat, founder of Hum2n longevity clinic, has tracked his health for seven years using wearables like Oura ring and Whoop strap, along with regular blood, urine, and microbiome tests. Based on the results, he adjusts his longevity routine, including supplements. His core supplements include daily cycles of B complex, folate, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While I believe these supplements have supported my biological age reversal, I credit them as one component in a much broader framework," Mr Enayat told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/a-longevity-doctor-takes-these-3-supplements-daily-2025-6" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;Business Insider.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Vitamin B complex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Enayat said he takes vitamin B complex and folate supplements due to a methylation gene defect that causes elevated homocysteine levels, increasing his risk of blood clots, heart attack, and stroke. The supplements help lower these levels. Generally, dietitians recommend obtaining nutrients through food and supplementing only when necessary, such as in cases of deficiency or inability to consume certain nutritious foods. Foods rich in B vitamins, like fish, poultry, legumes, and leafy greens, can also help reduce homocysteine levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests B vitamins may be linked to improved mood and dementia prevention, but further studies are required to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even without a methylation-related gene defect, I would still consider taking a methylated B complex, particularly during periods of high stress, poor sleep, or intensive training, as these increase the demand for B vitamins," Mr Enayat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Magnesium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Enayat takes magnesium bisglycinate due to his naturally low magnesium levels from dietary intake. This form is chosen for its better absorption, helping to boost his levels. Magnesium is essential for bone health, blood sugar regulation, and muscle function, and can also be found in foods like legumes and leafy greens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reported that taking magnesium helps reduce muscle aches and improves his sleep, allowing him to fall asleep more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Enayat takes a daily omega-3 supplement due to his naturally low levels. Omega-3s, found in oily fish, walnuts, and chia seeds, support heart health, reduce inflammation, and lower blood pressure. While eating fatty fish weekly is proven to protect against cardiovascular disease, the benefits of supplement form are less clear. However, some research suggests omega-3 supplements may have anti-ageing effects, with a recent study finding participants who took omega-3s daily had lower biological ages.&lt;/p&gt;

As more adults cross the half-century mark, that gradual loss of mental sharpness looms large, reshaping conversations about healthy aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent work following thousands of older Europeans now argues that one everyday choice casts a bigger shadow over &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/air-pollution-weakens-brain-function-and-focus-in-daily-tasks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt; and cognitive decline than most people realize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team led by University College London (&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;) analyzed lifestyle data from 32,000 adults in 14 European countries who were at least 50 years old and showed no signs of dementia when tracking began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across as many as 15 years, participants completed memory and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9999359/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;verbal-fluency tests&lt;/a&gt;, providing one of the most detailed portraits yet of how thinking skills change in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-behaviors-linked-to-cognitive-decline"&gt;Behaviors linked to cognitive decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators assembled sixteen lifestyle “packages” from four common habits: smoking, moderate or vigorous exercise at least once a week, weekly social contact with friends or family, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-marijuana-really-safer-than-alcohol-science-weighs-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;daily alcohol intake&lt;/a&gt; capped at two drinks for men or one for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared every package with a reference pattern that included all four healthy behaviors. By separating the habits instead of folding them into a single &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01254-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wellness score&lt;/a&gt;, the team could see which ones truly moved the needle on brain performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smoking may be among the most important lifestyle factors affecting how quickly our cognitive skills decline as we age,” suggests a new study led by UCL researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That headline finding emerged once the data were crunched: participants who smoked experienced the steepest drops in test scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their memory and word-finding abilities fell up to 85 percent more over ten years than scores among non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smoking-s-outsized-impact"&gt;Smoking’s outsized impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study is observational, so cannot definitively establish cause and effect, but it suggests smoking might be a particularly important factor influencing the&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/does-vaping-help-people-quit-smoking-cigarettes-new-study-breaks-it-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; rate of cognitive ageing&lt;/a&gt;,” lead author Dr. Mikaela Bloomberg explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that earlier studies linked clusters of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forming-healthy-habits-takes-much-longer-than-21-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy habits&lt;/a&gt; to slower decline, yet those studies rarely teased apart which behaviors mattered most. By isolating each habit, the new analysis revealed that lighting up stood apart from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when cigarettes dropped out of the picture, the remaining lifestyle combinations produced very similar cognitive trajectories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether participants exercised a little less, enjoyed an extra drink, or skipped a weekly gathering, their brains aged at nearly the same pace as those following the reference lifestyle – as long as they did not smoke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous evidence suggests that individuals who engage in healthier behaviors experience slower cognitive decline; however, it was unclear whether all behaviors contribute equally to cognitive decline or whether specific behaviors drive these results,” Dr. Bloomberg added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smoking-biology-and-cognition"&gt;Smoking, biology, and cognition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cigarette smoke&lt;/a&gt; exposes tiny cerebral blood vessels to a mix of toxins that stiffen vessel walls and limit oxygen flow. The same chemicals spark chronic inflammation, leaving neurons vulnerable to damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over years, those insults can accelerate the shrinkage of key brain regions linked to memory and language. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise, moderate drinking, and social engagement can bolster overall health, but they struggle to counter the direct harm tobacco inflicts on neural tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the study offered a glimmer of good news for current smokers who embrace other healthy habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that among the healthy behaviors we examined, not smoking may be among the most important in terms of maintaining cognitive function,” Dr Bloomberg said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For people who aren’t able to stop smoking, our results suggest that engaging in other healthy behaviors such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/metamorphosis-exercise-triggers-molecular-changes-in-major-organs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/a&gt;, moderate alcohol consumption and being socially active may help offset adverse cognitive effects associated with smoking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cognitive-decline-and-global-health"&gt;Cognitive decline and global health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, about one in five adults continues to smoke, and the habit remains more common in lower-income regions where dementia care is often scarce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because memory loss erodes independence, quitting earlier in life can spare families emotional strain and reduce medical costs tied to long-term care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new analysis strengthens the case for investing in cessation services – nicotine-replacement therapy, counseling, and prescription aids – before cognitive slips gain momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers accounted for age, gender, education, wealth, chronic illnesses, and country of residence, confirming that smoking’s influence held steady even after those factors were considered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By following participants over such a long span, the team also captured changes that shorter studies might miss, reinforcing confidence in the pattern they observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-now-that-you-know-what-will-you-do"&gt;Now that you know, what will you do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping cigarettes emerges as the clearest step toward safeguarding late-life thinking, yet the study suggests that pairing a smoke-free routine with modest weekly movement, sensible drinking limits, and regular social contact yields an even sturdier foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brisk walk through the neighborhood, a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/morning-coffee-drinkers-have-a-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cup of coffee&lt;/a&gt; with a friend, and a single evening drink offer manageable ways to keep neurons working smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline rarely arrives overnight, but its grip tightens with each passing year. This large-scale European study highlights how one habit – smoking – quickens the slide more than any other measured behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with that insight, adults can stack the odds in their favor: stub out the cigarette, stay active, connect with others, and enjoy alcohol in moderation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small choices made today shape the clarity of tomorrow’s thoughts, giving every reader a practical path toward a sharper, more confident future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49262-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:36:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQUGo1SFRUMnR1R2p2ek01eS05cnlVc0tvQmljSTJsdmJpWFJFZGNibTBlOS1HaDY1UVRMVUU5YUdxb0lZeTI0QUJ3YmxYN3lCakdnYTZyOTBpZlZEMU9Lc0R3RmJCQ0RHSWd4bWktR1VRaGZReUs4N2N1UVJhS3F3cFZIbU9GUUhGOFFCOGFkNlllUUk5SFNWM1FwM0Z0TzJ4Z0s1MjVqb2NiTWVMd3M3MFV5TQ</guid></item><item><title>医生分享了5个简单的肝脏自然排毒技巧：无需果汁清洁|健康-印度斯坦时报-印度斯坦时报 | Doctor shares 5 simple tips to detox your liver naturally: No juice cleanses needed | Health - Hindustan Times - Hindustan Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi5gFBVV95cUxNVm9EYTNRSFVidDlvaVU3d25Bdngta1hPR0ZYQTMwUGlaY09jU1NINnVDMWRvWU8xR1J1S24tYXlKaVpoNHFhLVpfOTZ4a0JDUzlHS0QtRGFkVnFHNlZoNVlfX3VLakE5S0NFbW91UnJKRFU2LUpEdVMza1JZVmwwa3l4TG9MRDhCa040U2NuY2FhZFVWMkxkMnEwLW9tTlhSZ2NBSFNYN3dyYTlFOFlmOFhtMUN3YWhEelRabXNwUjU4UFB1dFJHNGVoU1hNUnNGNjllSThRcklzUjVVejZNZzR0WkpGQdIB6wFBVV95cUxOWmlPZWwxR3JEcmhnd3Q3RVhIejM5cTdoenRiRkU4ZEVrbGdESWEtX1JZVjVlX1JMZ0FwYzN6akNVMXVYQm9KWG54LU9qT0hnZGZvYTNDalJGMnNYZ196Tm01b2s5b0JSTjh3MW0wUDlNc2N2TzktMDRQZmY3U2hWS2huQkpfbUhGcm5Pb3ZuVWVfYXNMa0dNUlM4TzZVVVBnZFdrOVlEZ0pTcmVZTXpKM0lBUXNJOVE1NE4ySlJmY0dfU0xGQU9YUzVwczY2OEZTZlJ2MzVzY0xPaGJHdldqYXlGMWtDT3JWUURR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/doctor-shares-5-simple-tips-to-detox-your-liver-naturally-no-juice-cleanses-needed-101749637143047.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/liver" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="liver"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt; is among the most important and busiest organs in the human body but it takes the backseat when individuals consider their own &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/health" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;.

However, the health of the liver does not require extreme measures but rather steady, vigilant lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Swapnil Sharma, consultant, liver transplant, HPB and GI surgeon at Wockhardt Hospitals in Mumbai, suggested 5 tips to keep your liver heathy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. The excessive consumption of alcohol is among the most hazardous threats to liver health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/05/22/original/Screenshot_2025-05-22_142831_1747904353471.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Alcohol consumption can significantly impact liver health. (Freepik)" title="Alcohol consumption can significantly impact liver health. (Freepik)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Alcohol consumption can significantly impact liver health. (Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alcohol is metabolised in the liver and overuse can strain this process to the point where it leads to fat accumulation, inflammation and eventually diseases like alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Reducing or avoiding alcohol consumption is one of the best ways to defend your liver.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Diet also has an important role&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/07/27/550x309/larisa-birta-xBs-1aL7g-4-unsplash_1658907416964_1658907469960_1658907469960.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Eat healthy food: To keep your liver healthy, you need to eat foods that are rich in nutrients and help purify your blood.

Walnuts, beetroots, turmeric and garlic are a few foods you need to include in your diet.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A low processed food, high fruit, vegetable and whole grain diet promotes liver function. Processed foods have trans fats, added sugars, and artificial ingredients that can burden the liver and contribute to fat accumulation, elevating the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). On the other hand, foods that are high in nutrients facilitate liver detoxification and regeneration processes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Physical exercise is another essential factor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2020/04/14/Pictures/_f5717180-7e41-11ea-a716-f322ae116ff6.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Researchers have found that regular exercise could help prevent the most common type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma by activating a gene that suppresses tumour growth.(UNSPLASH)" title="Researchers have found that regular exercise could help prevent the most common type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma by activating a gene that suppresses tumour growth.(UNSPLASH)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Researchers have found that regular exercise could help prevent the most common type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma by activating a gene that suppresses tumour growth.(UNSPLASH)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exercise at regular intervals supports weight maintenance and decreases the risk of fatty liver disease. Sedentary lifestyles and obesity are directly related to liver impairment, more so NAFLD, which is increasingly becoming one of the most prevalent liver diseases globally. Even minimal physical activity such as walking or cycling for 30 minutes a day can make a significant difference to the liver.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Hydration is an afterthought but essential&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/04/19/550x309/drinking_water_1650380490251_1650380506319.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Not having enough water: Water can help flush out any waste from the human body.

Conversely, sugar-laden drinks such as sodas and energy drinks can cause liver fat buildup and insulin insensitivity. Switching from sugary beverages to water or black coffee is an easy but effective adjustment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Finally, avoiding self-medication is important&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_640x362/HT/p2/2016/03/22/Pictures/_936b5360-eff8-11e5-ac5f-8ebef762d494.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="People are putting their lives at risk by popping pills without medical advice, claims the report of a survey(HT Photo)" title="People are putting their lives at risk by popping pills without medical advice, claims the report of a survey(HT Photo)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;People are putting their lives at risk by popping pills without medical advice, claims the report of a survey(HT Photo)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most over-the-counter medications, particularly pain medications such as acetaminophen, are toxic when used in excess or improperly without medical direction. These drugs are metabolised by the liver, and excessive use can result in acute liver injury or even failure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the liver silently suffers, little daily decisions can make a huge difference in its health. With mindful eating, regular exercise, hydration, moderate alcohol consumption and careful medication use, we can maintain this essential organ and avoid long-term complications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

They’d ask one another to repeat a question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But by a few years ago, the loss had grown so severe that the couple of four decades began to alter their routines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Once regulars at the orchestra, they no longer listened to music. Longtime trivia fanatics and frequent champions, they opted to stay home instead of straining to pick questions out of gargled noise. At dinners with friends, they’d smile and nod and hope the reaction was appropriate for wherever the conversation had drifted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“It’s debilitating,” said Dennis O’Neil. “How can you relate to people when you can’t hear them?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;Dr. Melissa Sirois performs a hearing test on Dennis O’Neil, center, with his wife Susan O’Neil at his side during a pre-surgery appointment at the Vitale Ear, Nose &amp;amp; Throat clinic on Friday, June 6, 2025, in Zephyrhills. &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  Times ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;For years, the O’Neils had tried different hearing aids, but the devices just weren’t working for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Dennis, an avid swimmer who has eczema in his ears, found the hearing aids unbearably itchy. Susan, who struggled with ear infections, couldn’t stand the feeling of her ears being plugged by the molds. For hearing aids to work, they need to be worn consistently. The O’Neils were never able to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And so the retirement they’d dreamed of together — active and social and chock-full of quality time — was quieter than they’d hoped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Then, in December, their doctor told them about an emerging device that could help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Like a hearing aid, the &lt;a href="https://www.cochlear.com/us/en/home/products-and-accessories/cochlear-osia-system/osia-sound-processor?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=prosp_brnd_ci_o_can_ci-prog_nuc-ev&amp;amp;utm_content=cochlearproductsosia_rsa&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=21086588150&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADgAqWYVLnSOAp4cYrlIPR3KaYd5t&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwr5_CBhBlEiwAzfwYuCxVWKibgnDQFkqkTkp8hC0nZTR--cebHiIevx9IW_uAyT2yQJAyIxoCu-0QAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cochlear.com/us/en/home/products-and-accessories/cochlear-osia-system/osia-sound-processor?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=prosp_brnd_ci_o_can_ci-prog_nuc-ev&amp;amp;utm_content=cochlearproductsosia_rsa&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=21086588150&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADgAqWYVLnSOAp4cYrlIPR3KaYd5t&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwr5_CBhBlEiwAzfwYuCxVWKibgnDQFkqkTkp8hC0nZTR--cebHiIevx9IW_uAyT2yQJAyIxoCu-0QAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"&gt;Cochlear Osia System&lt;/a&gt; amplifies sound. But instead of sitting in the ear, the device is implanted into the skull. It uses bone vibrations to send sound directly to the inner ear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;It would require surgery, which gave the O’Neils some pause. Unlike with hearing aids, though, Medicare would pick up the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Could the Osia System restore their world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connection lost&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;They met in Chicago in the 1980s while working for a major paper-making company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;On weekends, Dennis would throw house parties. He had a big yard and a barbecue. Someone would often bring a keg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fXDgxBh article start my-32"&gt;&lt;p class="fXDgxBh__image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fXDgxBh__content"&gt;&lt;div class="fXDgxBh__stage--start"&gt;&lt;h2 class="fXDgxBh__headline"&gt;Keep up with Tampa Bay’s top headlines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="fXDgxBh__subheadline"&gt;Subscribe to our free DayStarter newsletter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="fXDgxBh__blurb"&gt;We’ll deliver the latest news and information you need to know every morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="fXDgxBh__stage--finish"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 25" class="fXDgxBh__success-icon"&gt;&lt;path d="M9.6 18.326L3.6 12.326L5.292 10.622L9.6 14.93L18.708 5.82205L20.4 7.52605L9.6 18.326ZM12 0.32605C10.4241 0.32605 8.86371 0.636439 7.4078 1.2395C5.95189 1.84255 4.62902 2.72647 3.51472 3.84077C1.26428 6.09121 0 9.14345 0 12.326C0 15.5086 1.26428 18.5609 3.51472 20.8113C4.62902 21.9256 5.95189 22.8095 7.4078 23.4126C8.86371 24.0157 10.4241 24.326 12 24.326C15.1826 24.326 18.2348 23.0618 20.4853 20.8113C22.7357 18.5609 24 15.5086 24 12.326C24 10.7502 23.6896 9.18976 23.0866 7.73385C22.4835 6.27794 21.5996 4.95507 20.4853 3.84077C19.371 2.72647 18.0481 1.84255 16.5922 1.2395C15.1363 0.636439 13.5759 0.32605 12 0.32605Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;h2 class="fXDgxBh__headline"&gt;You’re all signed up!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="fXDgxBh__blurb"&gt;Want more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox? &lt;strong&gt;Let’s get started.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/newsletters/" class="ui__button--call-to-action" data-tbtevent="link" data-tbtcategory="Newsletter Sign Up Form" data-tbtlabel='{"element":"All newsletters link"}'&gt;Explore all your options&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 19 19" class="fXDgxBh__link-icon"&gt;&lt;path d="M18.2334 9.32605C18.2334 11.713 17.2852 14.0022 15.5974 15.69C13.9095 17.3778 11.6203 18.326 9.2334 18.326C8.0515 18.326 6.88118 18.0933 5.78925 17.641C4.69732 17.1887 3.70516 16.5257 2.86944 15.69C1.18161 14.0022 0.233398 11.713 0.233398 9.32605C0.233398 6.9391 1.18161 4.64992 2.86944 2.96209C4.55726 1.27426 6.84645 0.32605 9.2334 0.32605C10.4153 0.32605 11.5856 0.558842 12.6775 1.01113C13.7695 1.46343 14.7616 2.12636 15.5974 2.96209C16.4331 3.79782 17.096 4.78997 17.5483 5.8819C18.0006 6.97383 18.2334 8.14415 18.2334 9.32605ZM3.8334 10.226H11.0334L7.8834 13.376L9.1614 14.654L14.4894 9.32605L9.1614 3.99805L7.8834 5.27605L11.0334 8.42605H3.8334V10.226Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;It took some persuasion, but Susan eventually agreed to his invite. Dennis offered her a house tour, and they bonded over a love of music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;When Dennis tells the story, he likes to say Susan turned to him, smiling, and quipped, “I bet we could make some beautiful music together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Susan doesn’t remember it quite that way. The rest was history all the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The couple raised four kids. They moved to Texas and then Washington. Traveled to Japan and took family trips to Vancouver Island. They spent summers packed into a small RV with their kids, all string musicians at the time — violins and violas and a double-bass in tow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Dennis had a knack for finding conversation. He was the type to chat up campground guests and then invite them to spur-of-the-moment concerts put on by his kids. He made friends wherever they’d go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;As their hearing declined, it’s that spontaneity that Dennis and Susan miss most — with strangers and each other, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;When necessity prompts it — at a doctor’s appointment or on a family video call — people will find a way to get information across. They’ll say something loudly. They’ll say it slowly. They’ll write it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But much of human connection, Susan and Dennis have learned, lives in the in-between. The inside jokes, the witty remarks, the callbacks that don’t feel important enough to repeat five times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;When your hearing goes, those interactions do, too. The feeling of closeness starts to fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;The Osia System is a bone-anchored hearing aid that uses digital vibration to send sound directly into the bones of the skull, which then carry the sound to the inner ear to bypass damaged areas of the outer and middle ear. It is designed for individuals with conductive hearing loss, mixed hearing loss, or single-sided deafness, and is being implanted by Zephyrhills Dr. Joseph Derbyshire, with Vitale Ear, Nose &amp;amp; Throat, into patients Susan and Dennis O’Neil. &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  Times ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;About 30% of people ages 65 to 74, and nearly half of seniors 75 and older, live with hearing loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Not coincidentally, more than a third of U.S. seniors report feeling lonely, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Studies have found that seniors treated effectively for hearing loss &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/addressing-hearing-loss-may-reduce-isolation-among-elderly#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20U.S.%20Centers,with%20communication%20and%20relationship%20building." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;maintain more connections&lt;/a&gt;, while untreated hearing loss has been linked to a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(23)00232-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;mortality&lt;/a&gt;. One study found that people with severe hearing impairment were five times more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-hidden-risks-of-hearing-loss" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;develop dementia&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a higher risk of Alzheimer’s, too, which hits close to home for the O’Neils. Both Dennis’s and Susan’s mothers had the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Still, many seniors go without care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Insurance plans, including traditional Medicare, rarely cover hearing aids, which can cost thousands. Among adults 70 and older who could benefit from hearing aids, fewer than 1 in 3 has used them, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. The number is lower for &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2826274" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Black, Hispanic and other minority&lt;/a&gt; populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Now, implants like the Cochlear Osia, offer an alternative path for some — with full insurance coverage. But the process is more invasive and less known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Renewed hearing and hope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Not everyone is a good candidate for the Osia implant, but doctors at Vitale Ear, Nose &amp;amp; Throat in Zephyrhills ran tests and determined that both Susan and Dennis hit the mark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;They synced their appointments each step of the way, from a consultation to a pre-op and then surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Dennis had a harder time with recovery, since a blood thinner made healing more difficult. But when it was time to activate the devices in April, he was ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;Dennis O'Neil, 77, left, is examined by Dr. Joseph Derbyshire during a pre-surgery appointment at the Vitale Ear, Nose &amp;amp; Throat clinic on Friday, June 6, 2025, in Zephyrhills. &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R.

Women largely weren’t included in medical research and clinical trials until &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/why-we-know-so-little-about-women-s-health" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="the early 1990s" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.aamc.org/news/why-we-know-so-little-about-women-s-health" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;the early 1990s&lt;/a&gt; (yes, you read that right, only 30 years ago), which has caused gaps in knowledge when it comes to health treatments for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, there are entire practices and specialities that focus on the differences in health outcomes for women, and doctors who are passionate about furthering research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spoke with doctors who focus on various aspects of women’s health about the health habits they avoid and what they wish all patients knew about their well-being. Here’s what they’d never do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Discount the importance of movement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m moving all day long. And I think if everyone can make it a habit to just keep moving, our general health would be better in so many ways,” said &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1023498490/priya-m-freaney-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Priya Freaney" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1023498490/priya-m-freaney-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Priya Freaney&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and women’s heart health specialist at Northwestern Medicine in Illinois. Freaney added that she stretches every day at a minimum to prep her body for a day of rushing around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I run a postpartum hypertension clinic where I see new moms who have had blood pressure or other heart problems during pregnancy, and I tell people that as new moms, you have to be kind of creative in where you get your movement because there’s not a lot of time and there’s a lot of other responsibility,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to fold in movement whenever you can is key, whether that’s taking the stairs, going on stroller walks or walking instead of driving to your errands, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certainly compared to generations previous to us, we have more of an emphasis on exercise. Most people have sitting jobs, we spend most of our day sedentary, and we know that the biggest killer of women is heart disease, so as we get older, it becomes more and more important to protect our hearts, keep those arteries clear by doing things like exercising,” added &lt;a href="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/brintha-vasagar/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Brintha Vasagar" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/brintha-vasagar/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Brintha Vasagar&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="also lessen" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;also lessen&lt;/a&gt; feelings of anxiety and depression, help you sleep better and lowers the risk of certain cancers, &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/exercise" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="including breast cancer" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/exercise" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;including breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Skip out on nutrition. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three experts told HuffPost that healthy eating is one of the pillars they stick to for their current health and future health. This means fresh foods and less meat for &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/obgyn/team/777/clara-paik---gynecology---obstetrics-and-gynecology-sacramento/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Clara Paik" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.ucdavis.edu/obgyn/team/777/clara-paik---gynecology---obstetrics-and-gynecology-sacramento/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Clara Paik&lt;/a&gt;, the co-chief of the division of general obstetrics and gynecology at UC Davis Health in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vasagar described diet as well-being 101 and said she limits processed foods and focuses on lean meats, fresh fruits and veggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freaney said she follows an 80-20 rule, where 80% of the time she eats nutritious foods and the other 20% of the time she chooses foods that may not have a big nutritional benefit but are celebratory or joy-inducing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freaney also tries to limit bready sweets, overall, because of their high levels of cholesterol and saturated fats. She also cooks at home often and makes extra so she has easy, healthy meals throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Ignore their numbers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Vasagar and Freaney said it’s important that you know your numbers — meaning, the factors that are generally checked through routine wellness and blood tests such as your blood pressure, blood sugar levels and cholesterol, in addition to your weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people wait until they have a problem to get their numbers checked, but that isn’t the way to live a long, healthy life, noted Vasagar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s those prevention strategies — knowing what your blood pressure is, knowing what your ideal weight should be for your body size, knowing what your sugars are and if you’re at risk for diabetes — catching those things early,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/risk-factors/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Having high blood pressure and high cholesterol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/risk-factors/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Having high blood pressure and high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; can put you at heightened risk of developing heart disease, but, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can help get these numbers in a healthy range, and medication can help, too, noted Vasagar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why it’s so important to know your numbers early, so you can do something about it, attack it and keep your health as optimal as possible for as long as possible,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Disregard their heart disease risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women in the United States — a fact that many people don’t realize, said Freaney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sixty million women in the United States have some form of heart disease and 80% of that is preventable to some degree,” Freaney noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The common forms of heart diseases that can affect and ultimately kill women start early in life and accumulate silently in the body without us realizing it ... before they come to clinical significance, before we feel something that leads our doctors to discover it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earlier you can understand and address your heart disease risk factors (things like diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure) the better, Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, one piece of advice is that it is never too early for a woman to seek advice about their heart health,” she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Grace Cary via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Grace Cary via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;It's important that you know your health numbers, including blood pressure, so you can keep them in control and make changes to stay healthy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Purchase scented creams and washes for their genitals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really tell people, and I myself, never douche or put something to cleanse your vagina,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re basically getting rid of the normal flora that’s supposed to be there,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flora is necessary for maintaining a healthy pH balance, maintaining a barrier against bacteria and fungal infections and more. So, disrupting it can cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women are extremely, almost too, hygienic in that area because they want to smell nice, and that’s a particular area of concern,” Paik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lots of brands market lotions and soaps for the genital region, they aren’t necessary or even safe. “Just normal showering and washing with water is all you need to do in that area. You do not need to use soaps, perfumes, bath bombs, douching. I avoid any of that,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Skip prenatal vitamins when pregnant and trying to get pregnant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For pregnant women, I always tell them to take prenatal vitamins,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The folic acid in the prenatal vitamins is not the same as in multivitamins, it has an extra dose of folic acid, which is important for preventing spinal cord abnormalities in the baby,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are trying to get pregnant should also take prenatal vitamins, Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Ignore the impact that pregnancy complications can have on your heart health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Freaney, pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes can put you at higher risk of heart disease later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3034989/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3034989/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that people who had preeclampsia are at higher risk of stroke and&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/diabetes-during-pregnancy-may-increase-risk-of-heart-disease" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" those who had" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/diabetes-during-pregnancy-may-increase-risk-of-heart-disease" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt; those who had&lt;/a&gt; gestational diabetes are more likely to have heart artery calcification. This is true even if your blood sugar levels and other heart health markers go back to normal after pregnancy, Freaney noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals who have had pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia or gestational diabetes should have a proactive discussion with their doctors about how they can reduce their risk of heart disease,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Suffer in silence during perimenopause and menopause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Menopause is a big topic these days ... every woman is so different in terms of how they view and feel during menopause,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some folks have hot flashes and night sweats for a few months while others are plagued with tough symptoms for years and years, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how menopause impacts you, it isn’t a time to throw your hands up and say “oh well” or think you have to silently push through the discomfort. “I, myself, just realized, ‘Wow, this is the latter half of my life, I have one life to live. I better take good care of myself,’” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really kicked into the nutrition and exercise and just trying to keep myself healthy, rather than dealing with illness once it happens,” she noted. And going on hormone treatment is also a good option for many women, Paik added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know that estrogen has been a really hot topic, and that also is one of those things where our medical opinions on hormone replacement and the benefits and risks of estrogen have changed over time as we’ve gotten more information,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while, women strayed away from hormone treatments because of fears of breast cancer risk, Vasagar noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, I think we’re starting to get back into how can we use hormones to benefit women, protecting their heart health, protecting from osteoporosis, while also mitigating any risk that each individual has towards breast cancer and some other things that estrogen can contribute to,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Ignore the impact menopause has on cardiovascular health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/menopause" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="menopause" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/menopause" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; bring hot flashes, mood changes and bone density loss, it also brings negative changes to heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a big shift that happens there. We lose our natural estrogen levels, and with the loss of natural estrogen, our whole cardiometabolic profile shifts for the worst,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I try to counsel my female patients that the years around menopause are really a time of accelerating cardiovascular risk, and we need to go into that decade of life in the most optimal cardiovascular health to brace ourselves for this transition that is going to inevitably come to every woman,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around menopause, your blood pressure increases, your LDL cholesterol (also known as the bad cholesterol) goes up and your HDL cholesterol (your good cholesterol) goes down, according to Freaney. Your fat mass goes up while your muscle mass goes down, she added. Your sleep and mood worsens, too, which can have downstream effects on exercise and nutrition — because who wants to go for a bike ride after a night of bad sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

Here’s what they’d never do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Discount the importance of movement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m moving all day long. And I think if everyone can make it a habit to just keep moving, our general health would be better in so many ways,” said &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1023498490/priya-m-freaney-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Priya Freaney" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1023498490/priya-m-freaney-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Priya Freaney&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and women’s heart health specialist at Northwestern Medicine in Illinois. Freaney added that she stretches every day at a minimum to prep her body for a day of rushing around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I run a postpartum hypertension clinic where I see new moms who have had blood pressure or other heart problems during pregnancy, and I tell people that as new moms, you have to be kind of creative in where you get your movement because there’s not a lot of time and there’s a lot of other responsibility,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to fold in movement whenever you can is key, whether that’s taking the stairs, going on stroller walks or walking instead of driving to your errands, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certainly compared to generations previous to us, we have more of an emphasis on exercise. Most people have sitting jobs, we spend most of our day sedentary, and we know that the biggest killer of women is heart disease, so as we get older, it becomes more and more important to protect our hearts, keep those arteries clear by doing things like exercising,” added &lt;a href="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/brintha-vasagar/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Brintha Vasagar" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/brintha-vasagar/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Brintha Vasagar&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="also lessen" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;also lessen&lt;/a&gt; feelings of anxiety and depression, help you sleep better and lowers the risk of certain cancers, &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/exercise" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="including breast cancer" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/exercise" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;including breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Skip out on nutrition. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three experts told HuffPost that healthy eating is one of the pillars they stick to for their current health and future health. This means fresh foods and less meat for &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/obgyn/team/777/clara-paik---gynecology---obstetrics-and-gynecology-sacramento/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Clara Paik" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.ucdavis.edu/obgyn/team/777/clara-paik---gynecology---obstetrics-and-gynecology-sacramento/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Clara Paik&lt;/a&gt;, the co-chief of the division of general obstetrics and gynecology at UC Davis Health in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vasagar described diet as well-being 101 and said she limits processed foods and focuses on lean meats, fresh fruits and veggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freaney said she follows an 80-20 rule, where 80% of the time she eats nutritious foods and the other 20% of the time she chooses foods that may not have a big nutritional benefit but are celebratory or joy-inducing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freaney also tries to limit bready sweets, overall, because of their high levels of cholesterol and saturated fats. She also cooks at home often and makes extra so she has easy, healthy meals throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Ignore their numbers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Vasagar and Freaney said it’s important that you know your numbers — meaning, the factors that are generally checked through routine wellness and blood tests such as your blood pressure, blood sugar levels and cholesterol, in addition to your weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people wait until they have a problem to get their numbers checked, but that isn’t the way to live a long, healthy life, noted Vasagar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s those prevention strategies — knowing what your blood pressure is, knowing what your ideal weight should be for your body size, knowing what your sugars are and if you’re at risk for diabetes — catching those things early,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/risk-factors/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Having high blood pressure and high cholesterol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/risk-factors/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Having high blood pressure and high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; can put you at heightened risk of developing heart disease, but, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can help get these numbers in a healthy range, and medication can help, too, noted Vasagar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why it’s so important to know your numbers early, so you can do something about it, attack it and keep your health as optimal as possible for as long as possible,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Disregard their heart disease risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women in the United States — a fact that many people don’t realize, said Freaney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sixty million women in the United States have some form of heart disease and 80% of that is preventable to some degree,” Freaney noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The common forms of heart diseases that can affect and ultimately kill women start early in life and accumulate silently in the body without us realizing it ... before they come to clinical significance, before we feel something that leads our doctors to discover it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earlier you can understand and address your heart disease risk factors (things like diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure) the better, Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, one piece of advice is that it is never too early for a woman to seek advice about their heart health,” she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Grace Cary via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Grace Cary via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;It's important that you know your health numbers, including blood pressure, so you can keep them in control and make changes to stay healthy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Purchase scented creams and washes for their genitals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really tell people, and I myself, never douche or put something to cleanse your vagina,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re basically getting rid of the normal flora that’s supposed to be there,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flora is necessary for maintaining a healthy pH balance, maintaining a barrier against bacteria and fungal infections and more. So, disrupting it can cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women are extremely, almost too, hygienic in that area because they want to smell nice, and that’s a particular area of concern,” Paik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lots of brands market lotions and soaps for the genital region, they aren’t necessary or even safe. “Just normal showering and washing with water is all you need to do in that area. You do not need to use soaps, perfumes, bath bombs, douching. I avoid any of that,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Skip prenatal vitamins when pregnant and trying to get pregnant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For pregnant women, I always tell them to take prenatal vitamins,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The folic acid in the prenatal vitamins is not the same as in multivitamins, it has an extra dose of folic acid, which is important for preventing spinal cord abnormalities in the baby,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are trying to get pregnant should also take prenatal vitamins, Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Ignore the impact that pregnancy complications can have on your heart health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Freaney, pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes can put you at higher risk of heart disease later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3034989/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3034989/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that people who had preeclampsia are at higher risk of stroke and&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/diabetes-during-pregnancy-may-increase-risk-of-heart-disease" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" those who had" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/diabetes-during-pregnancy-may-increase-risk-of-heart-disease" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt; those who had&lt;/a&gt; gestational diabetes are more likely to have heart artery calcification. This is true even if your blood sugar levels and other heart health markers go back to normal after pregnancy, Freaney noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals who have had pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia or gestational diabetes should have a proactive discussion with their doctors about how they can reduce their risk of heart disease,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.

I better take good care of myself,’” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really kicked into the nutrition and exercise and just trying to keep myself healthy, rather than dealing with illness once it happens,” she noted.

If human hemoglobin is present, blood has likely leaked into the digestive system, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://divisionofresearch.kaiserpermanente.org/researchers/levin-theodore/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Theodore R.

Well, cancerous tissue — and even large benign polyps — is more likely to bleed than normal health tissue in the colon, Levin said. But the blood isn’t always noticeable when you go to the bathroom. In fact, the FIT was designed because growing polyps and cancers tend to microscopically bleed, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/luigi_ricciardiello.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Luigi Ricciardiello" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683f1e5ce4b049ed4229b599" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/luigi_ricciardiello.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Luigi Ricciardiello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a professor of medicine in the department of gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in Houston.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A positive result indicates there’s blood in your stool, which could mean you have colorectal cancer. That said, abnormal test results do not automatically mean you have cancer, as there are other health conditions, like hemorrhoids or benign polyps, that also cause bleeding. If your FIT finds blood, however, you’ll definitely want to follow up with a colonoscopy to get an accurate diagnosis, Levin advised. “A positive FIT test should never be the end test.

The cases are part of a growing measles outbreak — the biggest in the western hemisphere since late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada had officially wiped out measles back in 1998, meaning it wasn’t spreading regularly anymore. But with more than 2,000 cases reported in Ontario since October — more than the entire U.S. so far this year — that status could be in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine isn’t given during pregnancy because it contains a live virus. But if an unvaccinated pregnant person is exposed to measles, doctors recommend a dose of intravenous immunoglobulin to help prevent infection. Still, some people refuse that too, often for personal or philosophical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is &lt;keyword id="27258991" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="congenital-measles" source="keywords"&gt;congenital measles&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congenital measles is when a baby is born already infected with the measles virus. It happens when a pregnant woman catches measles and passes it on to their baby before birth. While measles is dangerous at any age, it can be especially serious for newborns — and even more so when they’re exposed to it before they’re even born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, babies get some natural protection from their mother’s immune system while they’re in the womb. But if the mom hasn’t been vaccinated and gets infected with measles during pregnancy, that protection isn’t there — and the virus can pass straight to the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Stay ready with these 7 essential medical gadgets as COVID cases rise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of early exposure can lead to all sorts of complications. Congenital measles can cause a baby to be born too early (premature), have a low birth weight, or develop serious issues like brain inflammation (known as encephalitis). In really severe cases, it can even lead to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scary part? This is something that’s usually preventable. The measles vaccine (MMR) is super effective and has been around for decades. But it’s not given during pregnancy because it contains a live virus. That’s why it’s so important to get vaccinated before becoming pregnant — or, if already pregnant and exposed to measles, to talk to a doctor about getting immune protection another way, like through intravenous immunoglobulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While congenital measles is rare — especially in countries with high vaccination rates — outbreaks and rising vaccine hesitancy have made it more of a concern lately. With strong public health programs and informed choices, it’s a risk that can be reduced, if not entirely avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 10:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>“刀片喉咙” ： “Nimbus” COVID变种引发了人们对夏季浪潮的担忧- Salon.com | "Razor blade throat": The "Nimbus" COVID variant sparks concern of summer surge - Salon.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPeFhxV056aTdKWmVDRU5QMGM5NWFaTTY3bFd5bHB3U2VVRmVRQ1A5dHNWUnVhbXYwOWtfbWducVdvYVNNQTR3MVN5eGJmaW1PWkxLOFNjQkJjeUtwMUJVclVoTlVieFh6VDV1QlEwNEN0WU54bmEtV1VLdWNVT1dyWl8zbDhUbndSRDVFczdWM0lIV3VIbzk3X2J6T29NU3FaYVNTWA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="article-content"&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;Post-pandemic amnesia is a natural reaction, and it’s common for misremembering to occur after a pandemic or collective traumatic event occurs. Yet the reality is that SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/covid-19" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, is still finding ways to infect people by evolving new mutations, and a new variant has raised concern among virologists that continue to track the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;labeled&lt;/a&gt; the COVID variant NB.1.8.1 a “variant under monitoring” because it has been surging across Asia and made up 10.7% of global sequences reported as of mid-May. Now, the variant has been detected in the United States, Europe and Canada as well, concerning virus trackers who — for the first time since the &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/08/20/a-new-variant-nicknamed-pirola-is-raising-global-alarm-but-dont-freak-out-yet/" target="_blank"&gt;Pirola variant began circulating in August 2023&lt;/a&gt; — bestowed upon it a nickname: Nimbus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nimbus has recombined genetic material from other strains three times. Although the process of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/11/14/recombinant-strains-explainer/" target="_blank"&gt;recombination is a natural process&lt;/a&gt; of viruses trying to evolve to survive among the population, recombination events are concerning because each time a virus does so, it has the potential to evolve into something that is more infectious or causes more severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these mutations in Nimbus allows it to evade the immunity we have built against the virus from prior infections, so transmissibility might be slightly higher, said Dr. Rajendram Rajnarayanan, of the New York Institute of Technology campus in Jonesboro, Arkansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;preprint study&lt;/a&gt;, not yet peer-reviewed, found that the way this variant binds to cells could make it infect them more efficiently than earlier strains and that it could be easier for this strain to be passed along to someone else. However, there has not been any evidence yet to suggest that Nimbus is linked to more severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimbus "is a strong candidate for the summer surge."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t seen a big surge in emergency departments due to COVID-related conditions and respiratory things in this term yet,” Rajnarayanan told Salon in a video call. “We have to wait and watch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, many people have been reporting a symptom called “razor blade throat,” but it’s unclear if this is a symptom of COVID or one of the many other viruses circulating. Overall, it is difficult to attribute certain symptoms to variants when there are more than a dozen circulating at a time and testing remains relatively low compared to earlier stages of the pandemic, said Dr. T. Ryan Gregory, an evolutionary and genome biologist at the University of Guelph in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That said, we learned from &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/05/02/as-mutates-the-vaccine-goalpost-has-shifted-to-preventing-severe-illness-and/" target="_blank"&gt;Omicron&lt;/a&gt; that high transmissibility can cause as much damage as high per infection virulence, and at this point it is not just acute severity that is of concern, but longer-term impacts of repeated infection,” Gregory told Salon in an email. Such impacts include conditions like "&lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/08/13/long-is-devastating-and-far-from-rare-as-infections-rise-again-why-are-we-still-ignoring-it/" target="_blank"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;," in which the symptoms of COVID last for months or years, often disabling patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, current data shows that most COVID infections in the U.S. are &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;currently caused by the LP.8.1 variant&lt;/a&gt;, which descends from Pirola. Both of these strains are technically still in the WHO’s Greek letter “Omicron” family, which now contains thousands of offspring. If there's one thing viruses are good at, it's mutating into new forms that can evade our immunity, whether that's from vaccines or past infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the WHO decided to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/updated-working-definitions-and-primary-actions-for--sars-cov-2-variants" target="_blank"&gt;only name variants with this system if they were considered a “variant of concern”&lt;/a&gt; and stated that certain action steps should be taken by countries if a variant fell under this classification. However, the agency has not labeled any variants like this since Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/covid-variant-namer-gregory-6e8e9d3d"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that some variants have been different enough to warrant a new name, and that not naming variants makes it more difficult to distinguish between the complex alphabet soup of variants that are circulating at any given time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Pirola, which included the BA.2.86 variant along with its descendants, was about as genetically different from the original Omicron strain as Omicron was from the original “wild strain” virus from Wuhan, China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in the past two years, “it’s largely been the Pirola show,” Gregory said. Current vaccines have been designed to protect against this strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Nimbus is not very common in the U.S., but it has been identified in California and has enough mutations in its spike protein that it has a potential to cause waves of illness in other regions — which is in part why it was designated a name. At-home tests should still work to detect this variant, but PCR tests that doctors can order are more accurate. Masking also helps prevent the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year following the start of the COVID pandemic, cases have surged in the summer. Last year's summer surge hit around August and was so intense that &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/08/22/is-getting-so-bad-new-vaccines-were-given-early-approval/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccines were approved slightly early&lt;/a&gt;. Although this year's summer wave hasn't yet started, experts predict we will likely experience another wave this summer. As it stands, variant trackers expect either Nimbus or another variant called XFG to be the dominant strain this time around. Although XFG currently makes up a greater proportion of cases in North America than NB.1.8.1, the latter has been &lt;a href="https://www.syracuse.com/coronavirus/2025/06/new-covid-variant-in-ny-what-to-know-about-symptoms-cases-vaccines.html" target="_blank"&gt;detected in New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-05-30/a-new-covid-subvariant-spreads-rapidly-as-trump-pivots-away-from-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NB.1.8.1 is a strong candidate for the summer surge,” Rajnarayanan said. “Yet what we know from previous instances is that it doesn't have to be a single variant that pushes up [to prominence] and sometimes it can be a group of variants … that pick up mutations from each other and recombine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Nimbus is still similar enough to the Pirola variants that the available vaccines were designed to target. That means they should still be effective, Gregory said. However, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-picks-new-strain-fall-covid-vaccines-means-shot-rcna208726"&gt;concerns have been raised&lt;/a&gt; that vaccine access may be limited this fall due to the Food and Drug Administration announcing it would require drugmakers to conduct a new set of clinical trials before approving new vaccines for use. Last month, the FDA also said it will &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/fda-significantly-limits-covid-19-vaccine-recommendations" target="_blank"&gt;only recommend&lt;/a&gt; COVID vaccines for adults 65 and older and those at risk for severe illness. Critics have said this will only make the vaccines &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/post/covid-19-vaccine-what-know-new-trump-policy-limits/16488196/" target="_blank"&gt;less likely to be covered by insurance&lt;/a&gt; and less available overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy announced he was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112"&gt;firing the expert panel&lt;/a&gt; that advises the Centers for Disease Control responsible for making recommendations on vaccines, further complicating matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paired with updated guidelines from the CDC that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc"&gt;drop recommendations for healthy pregnant women and kids&lt;/a&gt; to routinely get vaccinated, these changes from the federal government could have a chilling effect that leads fewer people to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m concerned about accessibility,” Rajnarayanan said, adding that it’s not clear if vaccines will be available to people without insurance that aren’t included in federal recommendations. “These kinds of things are still murky and I really want to see clearer guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many people may seem to have forgotten about COVID, people are still routinely hospitalized and killed by the virus. Additionally, each COVID nfection carries a risk of going on to develop long Covid, which continues to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/long-covid-world.html"&gt;debilitate millions of people&lt;/a&gt;. As we witnessed when COVID was a full-blown pandemic, emerging viruses can be especially damaging for people with existing conditions like diabetes, obesity and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to protect against things like long COVID not only for the well-being of people today but also for our susceptibility to future viruses, Rajnarayanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In different parts of the world, I’ve seen funding for continuous surveillance gone down, and not just for surveillance, which is important, but also studying the disease itself,” Rajnarayanan said. “This is not just about protecting [people] today but also protecting them from any other variant in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

properties, which help protect the body’s cells from damage as we age. They also support blood vessel health and may help preserve muscle and brain function. While not all flavonoids work in the same way, many appear to support the body’s systems that tend to decline with age.” &lt;br&gt;— Nicola Bondonno, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health data included the amount of flavonoid-rich foods and beverages study participants consumed, as well as information on their incident frailty, physical function, and mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the study’s conclusion, scientists found that female study participants with the highest flavonoid intake had a 15% lower risk of frailty, as well as a 12% lesser chance of impaired physical function. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that diets rich in flavonoid-containing foods may help older women maintain strength and mobility as they age — key factors in staying independent, avoiding falls, and preserving overall quality of life,” Bondonno explained. “Even modest improvements like these can make a real difference in someone’s ability to live well into older age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These same female participants also experienced a 12% lower risk of having poor mental health. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women with the highest flavonoid intake had a 12% lower risk of having evidence of mental health concerns such as feeling low, lacking energy, or having depressive symptoms. This finding is important because it shows that what we eat may play a role in supporting not just our physical health, but our emotional and psychological well-being as we age.”&lt;br&gt;— Nicola Bondonno, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Bondonno and her team did not find that high consumption of flavonoid-rich foods impact male participants in the same way it did female participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While male study participants with the highest flavonoid intake experienced a 15% decrease in their risk of poor mental health, there was no benefit when it came to lowering frailty or impaired physical function risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men vs. women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s possible that the difference we saw between men and women has more to do with how the study was structured than a true biological difference. The men were followed for a shorter period of time, so we may not have had enough data to detect certain effects. More research is needed to understand whether men and women truly respond differently to flavonoids.”&lt;br&gt;— Nicola Bondonno, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our next steps are to explore the two-way relationship between flavonoids and well-being — looking not only at how flavonoids may support mental health, but also how a person’s well-being might influence their intake of flavonoid-rich foods,” she continued. “We also plan to continue investigating how these foods can be used to support healthy aging and help people live longer, disease-free lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/manisha-santosh-parulekar/1319173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Division of Geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center and co-director of the Center for Memory Loss and Brain Health at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Flavonoids are potent antioxidants and have anti-inflammatory effects,” Parulekar said. “&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; and chronic inflammation are considered key drivers of aging and age-related diseases. By potentially slowing down these processes, flavonoids could theoretically slow down negative aspects of aging.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parulekar said that lifestyle modifications to improve the aging process through diet offer a proactive, accessible, and potentially transformative approach to promoting healthy longevity for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It represents a shift towards preventative healthcare and empowers individuals to take an active role in shaping their own health trajectory,” she continued. “Focusing on diet promotes a more holistic approach to health, addressing the root causes of aging-related decline rather than just treating symptoms. Dietary changes often have positive ripple effects on other aspects of health, such as weight management, energy levels, and mood.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For readers who would like to add more flavonoids to their diet, we asked &lt;a href="https://eatrightrx.com/about-monique-richard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, for her top tips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Flavonoids, including the six subtypes related to dietary sources — &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7504512/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;anthocyanidins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11313926/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;flavan-3-ols&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10183303/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;flavonols&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9470311/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;flavones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8007671/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;flavanones&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6470817/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;isoflavones&lt;/a&gt; — have been attributed to protecting cell degradation from oxidative stress and free radicals, as well as being anti-inflammatory due to their concentrated antioxidant levels. They also can act as a chelator (binder) to oxidizing effects of metal ions like &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/287228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/288165" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;br&gt;— Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard encouraged readers to consider the numerous foods rich in flavonoids and consider where they may be able to be added throughout the day and week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you think of ‘flavonoids’ think of flavor and see how adding some flare to your daily foods can punch up their benefit and appeal,” she continued. “Also keep in mind the benefit and bioavailability varies by food and per person — keeping the diet diverse and varied is key.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard said a sample diet featuring three servings of flavonol-rich foods a day may look like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast: &lt;/strong&gt;A cup of green tea or a smoothie with berries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunch:&lt;/strong&gt;

It formed about 11,000 years ago when a fist of magma punched up into the rolling hills of central France,  creating a volcano that spilled out lava before going dormant just a few hundred years later. For the past twenty years or so, a weather station on top of Puy de Dôme has been equipped with air samplers. The mountain is so high that clouds regularly blanket its peak, allowing scientists to capture some of the life they ferry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Studies led by Pierre Amato, an aerobiologist at the nearby University of Clermont Auvergne, have revealed that every millimeter of cloud water floating over Puy de Dôme &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182869" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;contains as many as 100,000 cells&lt;/a&gt;.

A hawk soaring over Puy de Dôme might fly over Amato's tubes and shake microbes off its feathers, for example. In Amato's laboratory, a graduate student may exhale germs into a test tube. Over the years, Amato has rejected thousands of potential species, suspicious that he or his students have inadvertently smeared skin microbes onto the equipment. But they have confidently discovered over &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182869" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;28,000 species of bacteria in clouds&lt;/a&gt;, and over 2,600 species of fungi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Amato and other scientists who study clouds suspect that they may be particularly good places for bacteria to survive – at least for some species. "Clouds are environments open to all, but where only some can thrive," Amato and a team of colleagues wrote in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;In a cloud, each microbe exists in perfect solitude, trapped in its own droplet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For bacteria, a cloud is like an alien world, dramatically different from the habitats where they usually live on land or at sea. Bacteria typically crowd together. In rivers they may grow into microbial mats. In our guts, they form dense films. But in a cloud, each microbe exists in perfect solitude, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809510001791" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;trapped in its own droplet&lt;/a&gt;. That isolation means that cloud bacteria don't have to compete with each other for limited resources. But a droplet doesn't have much room to carry the nutrients microbes need to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet Amato and his colleagues have found evidence that some microbes can indeed grow in clouds. In one study, the researchers compared samples they gathered from clouds on Puy de Dôme to others they collected on the mountain on clear days. The researchers looked for clues to their activity by comparing the amount of DNA in their samples to the amount of RNA. Active, growing cells will make a lot of copies of RNA from their DNA in order to produce proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers found that the ratio of RNA to DNA was &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/22/1257/2025/bg-22-1257-2025.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;several times higher in clouds than in clear air&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful clue that cells thrive in clouds. They also found that bacteria in clouds switch on genes essential for metabolising food and for growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To understand how these bacteria can thrive in clouds, the researchers have reared some of the species they've captured in their lab and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.authorea.com/users/908355/articles/1282315-phototrophy-improves-the-aerial-fitness-in-a-photoheterotrophic-methylobacterium-isolated-from-clouds?commit=70193b6f3a38a6c671ea5ac75784f75905678b22" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;then sprayed them into atmospheric simulation chambers&lt;/a&gt;.

Even at temperatures far below the freezing point, water molecules can remain liquid. One way to trigger the formation of ice, however, is to give them a seed of impurity. As water molecules stick to a particle's surface, they bond to one another, a process known as nucleation. Other water molecules then lock onto them and assemble into a crystal structure, which when heavy enough, will fall out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It turns out that biological molecules and cell walls are exceptionally good at triggering rain. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140407" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Fungi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/aem.01850-20" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;algae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/4/044015/meta" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;pollen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bioone.org/journals/lindbergia/volume-38/issue-1/linbg.01070/Ubiquity-of-ice-nucleation-in-lichen--possible-atmospheric-implications/10.25227/linbg.01070.full" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lichens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003JD003545" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/18/4431/2021/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/10/12/786" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;seed ice in clouds&lt;/a&gt;.

As the planet heated up, some microbes &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2020.2244" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;could have found refuge in the clouds&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of sinking back to the surface, they may have bobbed up and down in the atmosphere, riding currents for millions of years, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Thinking about Seager's alien aerobiome can make cloud-gazing even more enjoyable. But when we look at clouds, Amato's research has revealed, we are also looking up at our own influence on the world. When Amato and his colleagues have surveyed the genes in the microbes they capture, they find a remarkable number that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161264" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;endow bacteria with resistance to antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Down on the ground, we humans have spurred the widespread evolution of these resistance genes. By taking excessive amounts of penicillin and other drugs to fight infections, we favour mutants that can withstand them. Making matters worse, farmers feed antibiotics to chickens, pigs and other livestock in order to get them to grow to bigger sizes. In 2014 alone, 700,000 people died worldwide from infections of antibiotic‑resistant bacteria. Five years later, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;toll rose to 1.27 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The evolution of antibiotic resistance occurs within the bodies of humans and the animals humans eat. The bacteria endowed with this resistance then escape their nurseries and make their way through the environment – into the soil, into streams, and it turns out, even into the air. Researchers have found high levels of resistance genes in the bacteria &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-021-01197-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;floating through hospitals&lt;/a&gt; and around &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412023000247" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;pig farms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Winds can carry dust and microbes over hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Winds can carry dust and microbes over hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But airborne resistance genes can waft even further. An international team of scientists inspected the filters in automobile air conditioners in nineteen cities around the world. The filters had captured a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b02204" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;rich diversity of resistant bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. It appears, in other words, that resistance genes float through cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In recent years, Amato and his colleagues have charted even longer journeys. In a 2023 survey of clouds, they reported finding bacteria carrying &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722083681" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;29 different kinds of resistance genes&lt;/a&gt;.  A single airborne bacterium may carry as many as nine resistance genes, each providing a different defense against the drugs. Every cubic metre of cloud, they estimated, held up to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722083681" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;10,000 resistance genes&lt;/a&gt;. A typical cloud floating overhead may hold more than a trillion of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Amato and his colleagues speculate that clouds hold such a high number of resistance genes because they can help the bacteria survive there. Some genes provide antibiotic resistance by allowing bacteria to pump the drugs out of their interiors quickly, getting rid of them before they can cause damage. The stress of life in a cloud may cause bacteria to produce toxic waste that they need to pump out quickly as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Clouds may be able to spread these resistance genes farther than contaminated meat and water. Once in a cloud, bacteria can travel hundreds of miles in a matter of days before seeding a raindrop and falling back to Earth. When they reach the ground, the microbes may then pass along their resistance genes to other microbes they encounter. Every year, Amato and his colleagues estimate, 2.2 trillion trillion resistance genes &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cnrs.hal.science/hal-04300300v1/document" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;shower down from the clouds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is a sobering thought to hold in one's mind on a walk through the rain.

And that’s not a healthy strategy, said Alison Brown, a nutrition researcher at the National Institutes of Health. Diets like these can cause you to miss out on the range of nutrients your body requires, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A much better way to maintain healthy eating habits, she added, is to focus on foods that are not only nourishing, but also bring you joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That can be challenging when nutrition fads are coming and going with seemingly increasing speed, and often conflicting advice. Is saturated fat the enemy &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/well/eat/beef-tallow-oil-health.html" title=""&gt;or not&lt;/a&gt;?

Turns out, the best ways to foster healthy eating are also the simplest. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-411d297d"&gt;1. Prioritize whole foods.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Not all processed foods are unhealthy, but they’re often stripped of beneficial nutrients like fiber and certain vitamins and minerals, Dr. Brown said. And they may contain high levels of ingredients that can be harmful to health, like added sugars and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/well/eat/sodium-salt-diet.html" title=""&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Because of this, it’s best to consume foods “as close as possible to how they exist in nature,” Dr. Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
