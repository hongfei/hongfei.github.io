Now it’s a “question of whether there will be the political will and also the public sentiment to actually utilize this information for public good,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6TC66RU2FZGGLLCLCBGYGY3CMI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story is the last of a three-part series on five years of long covid.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200093b6m476qcxb0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            OK, she admits that maybe she doesn’t quite have the energy to bake pies anymore and should probably buy something from the grocery store next time. Even so, Parker said her 90s have been filled with purpose and connection –– something many people struggle with no matter their age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000a3b6mf7280xhl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Healthy behaviors like &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/09/health/live-longer-diet-wellness/index.html"&gt;nutritious eating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/15/health/strength-exercises-resistance-training-wellness"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; are important to living longer, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/19/health/loneliness-social-isolation-early-death-risk-wellness"&gt;loneliness and social isolation are also key factors&lt;/a&gt; to address to have more years and enjoy them, said California-based gerontologist Dr. Kerry Burnight, who is also Parker’s daughter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000b3b6mqexwzfn3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Life expectancy generally has improved in the last generation. But we want to make sure that individuals are living good years, as opposed to just living longer,” said Dr. John Batsis, a geriatrician and an associate professor at UNC’s School of Medicine and Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000c3b6mvygi2603@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A geriatrician is a medical doctor focusing on the care of older adults, while a gerontologist studies aging from the biological perspective as well as the social and psychological, Burnight said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000d3b6mi1fcoxc6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are four factors that Burnight sees as being the most important to getting the most joy out of your longer, healthier years: growing, connecting, adapting and giving. And fortunately, just like you can exercise daily to keep your body healthy, she says you can work out your internal strength to improve your connections and sense of purpose.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000e3b6mwuubajk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not too early or too late to start creating a life you enjoy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000f3b6m8aztyxto@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you haven’t retired yet, it may be a good idea to start thinking about what your days will look like when you stop working, Batsis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000g3b6mty1smgc2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The retirement cliff, so to speak, is very difficult for individuals who have been working a lifetime,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000h3b6mc1mawlr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It can feel like suddenly you lose everything –– a sense of purpose, how you fill your days and who you connect with –– when you are no longer going into work every day, especially if you have not made a plan, he said. Instead of making such a drastic change, Batsis advises people to start taking up hobbies and activities you’d like to do in retirement while you are still working.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000i3b6mu0bgcose@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you have already retired, you can find opportunities to build new things you love, Burnight said. If you have always wanted to publish a book, 80 isn’t too old to start writing. In fact, you may still have a lot of time ahead of you to invest in your passions, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000j3b6msrt48x36@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not too late at all. In fact, it’s the perfect time to really lean into and redefine it,” said Burnight, author of the upcoming book “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Joyspan-Science-Thriving-Lifes-Second/dp/1546007350" target="_blank"&gt;Joyspan&lt;/a&gt;: The Art and Science of Thriving in Life’s Second Half.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000k3b6m70k3e67t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Daily crossword puzzles or sudoku are a good way to engage your brain, but to stay cognitively sharp and increase the enjoyment of your older years it is important to do difficult things, Burnight said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000l3b6miwyha2br@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “New experiences activate neuro plasticity …  that is our brain’s ability to keep growing,” she said. “If you do the same things you’ve always done, you’re really not setting yourself up for continued growth.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000m3b6mlpcqatgm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of Batsis’ patients took up golf after he retired, but he also started playing a musical instrument guitar. It wasn’t something he had ever done before, and he didn’t consider himself musically inclined, but the activity opened up a whole new world for him, Batsis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000n3b6mq1oqid9p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, the patient plays the guitar and also attends local concerts that he might not have otherwise, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000o3b6mldo2q14x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Batsis recommends trying to find a hobby that will keep you physically active. The less you move, the weaker you get, and so he said that finding something that disrupts a sedentary pattern can be helpful in keeping more activities available to you as you get older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000p3b6mcm979skv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The key, however, is to find something you enjoy –– not to push yourself to activities you think you are supposed to do in your older age, Batsis said. If you never liked books, you probably won’t be motivated to become a reader in retirement, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000q3b6m730cy2z7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Individuals need to find something that is of interest to them, because the more interesting it is to them, the more they’re going to be willing to kind of engage in that type of activity.” Batsis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000r3b6mvnm4vce6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For caregivers, Burnight cautions against doing for your loved ones anything that they can do for themselves, which varies depending on their skill set or physical limitations. Doing challenging things is important and helpful, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000s3b6mz4be183v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About once a month, Parker meets with a group she calls “the youngs” to play canasta, which she taught them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000t3b6m3qjm314g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The youngs” are a group of women in their 60s whom she met through her daughter-in-law. Although they are much younger than her, Parker said she values having a diverse group of friends. That is especially true as she has outlived her husband and other close connections, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000u3b6miz8ty436@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Like how we diversify our financial portfolio, socially we want to have friends of different ages, friends from your neighborhood, as well as friends from the past,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000v3b6mwr7iwaln@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you need connection with more people from your past, Burnight recommends using social media to reach out to people whom you might have lost touch with over the years. People are usually happy to hear from an old friend, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000w3b6m2kl4or3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even small interactions with a neighbor or at your coffee shop can often lead to more meaningful relationships, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000x3b6mth7zgk5h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her most important piece of advice is to be the friend, Burnight said. Loneliness is dangerous to longevity, so investing in connection is important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000y3b6mbp79ntop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You need to be the one to call to make a plan or to remember a birthday, or to sit by somebody’s hospital bed or to drive them to their chemo,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmcuu1otv001c3b6mn14o5iz7@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="finding-joy-and-purpose" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Finding joy and purpose
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000z3b6m5n0y91xf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Parker has a lot of joy in her 90s, it hasn’t come without a need to adapt, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200103b6mi1aeolw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She had to give up tennis years ago, which she misses, and now she has to use a walker to get around sometimes, she said. But those changes haven’t prevented her from laughing with her family, spending time in her yard or even being in a local parade for the Fourth of July holiday, Parker said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200113b6m2xb4w7pq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are always going to have changing circumstances, and growing older brings a lot of challenge,” Burnight said. “Instead of just denying that or saying, ‘Oh, my life can’t be great now that I’ve had these things,’ the ones who age well are the ones that adapt, meaning they’re able to accept and even embrace change.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200123b6mc8eg6eeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The way that you adapt largely is recognizing that it isn’t wrong that you’re going to have tough stuff. It’s how you’re going to respond to that tough stuff,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200133b6mxpmz0h0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34498894/" target="_blank"&gt;Research has suggested&lt;/a&gt; that how you think about aging profoundly impacts how you actually age, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200143b6mnjpz36gx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People who believe that aging is a time of continued growth &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12150226/" target="_blank"&gt;live 7.5 years longer&lt;/a&gt; than those who think, ‘Oh, I’m old. I’m going to retire and just go knit with the ladies,’” Burnight said. Unless, of course, you enjoy knitting or want to pick it up as a new hobby.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200153b6mxxeff3qn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, she recommends turning your attention to all you have to give. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37037156/" target="_blank"&gt;Evidence also suggests&lt;/a&gt; that people who give report higher levels of joy, purpose and longevity, Burnight said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200163b6m3dr4epo6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sounds like a lot to do all at once? Don’t worry. You can start small.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200173b6mv8smocz4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maybe it is delivering a lemon from your tree to a friend or offering to watch your neighbors’ young children while they run errands, she said. Even creating art, planting a garden or giving someone who is sick a call is an act of giving that can give you purpose, Burnight said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200183b6m7ib6ofup@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Purpose is small and daily and a decision,” she said. “It’s saying, ‘Okay, today, how am I going to use the fact that I’m alive and that I have things to give?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;What's good for your aging gut may also be good for your aging brain. The first study of its kind in twins found that taking daily protein and prebiotic supplements can improve scores on memory tests in people over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published early last year, the findings are food for thought, especially as the same visual memory and learning test is used to detect early signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="167265" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The double-blinded trial involved two cheap plant fiber prebiotics that are available over the counter in numerous nations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary on the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prebiotics are non-digestible consumables that help stimulate our gut microbes. One of the supplements was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inulin"&gt;inulin&lt;/a&gt;; a dietary fiber in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructan"&gt;fructan&lt;/a&gt; class. The other, a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructooligosaccharide"&gt;fructooligosaccharide&lt;/a&gt; (FOS), is a plant carbohydrate often used as a natural low calorie sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the effect of these supplements on the aging brain, researchers at King's College London enrolled 36 pairs of twins over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each duo was randomly split so that one twin was assigned a daily prebiotic in a protein powder and the other was assigned a daily  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="167265" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; in a protein powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twin who unknowingly took inulin or FOS generally scored higher on a cognitive test three months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-this-blue-chemical-really-boost-your-brain-heres-what-we-know?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Can This Blue Chemical Really Boost Your Brain?

Haver &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-k-SI3iygw"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; she “fell in love” with weighted vests as a way to help her patients with osteoporosis.

After my sister told me she thinks strength training changed her metabolism, I invested in a pair of six-pound dumbbells, which mostly sit untouched in my living room. But I do like to walk, so I was intrigued: Would adding a weighted vest be a shortcut to some of the benefits of lifting?&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxkgh9001s3b770eecx1xd@published" data-word-count="139"&gt;Most weighted vests look similar to a life jacket that you strap on over your clothes, and they’re typically filled with tiny iron pellets to distribute the weight across your upper back and torso. The market is already crowded with options ranging from the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ZELUS-Weighted-Reflective-Strength-Weightlifting/dp/B081JLDJLB/ref=asc_df_B081JLDJLB?mcid=6d7acffc9b4e37ba830967e23534b3ec&amp;amp;hvocijid=18335661378070239616-B081JLDJLB-&amp;amp;hvexpln=73&amp;amp;tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=721245378154&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=18335661378070239616&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9004381&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435179778&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c20709aam__cmcuxhsm9000l0idp0byl2ayk__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;$30 Zelus vest&lt;/a&gt; that’s &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fabuloushaitian/video/7496982217026096430?q=weighted%20vest&amp;amp;t=1751986203244"&gt;all over TikTok&lt;/a&gt; to much pricier, heavier, and &lt;a href="https://www.trxtraining.com/products/trx-weight-vest?variant=43372603539596&amp;amp;country=US%C2%A4cy=USD&amp;amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;amp;nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ag%3A22337365570%3A176519267019%3A738542319302&amp;amp;nb_adtype=pla&amp;amp;nb_kwd=&amp;amp;nb_ti=pla-293946777986&amp;amp;nb_mi=4622463&amp;amp;nb_pc=online&amp;amp;nb_pi=shopify_US_7955255427212_43372603539596&amp;amp;nb_ppi=293946777986&amp;amp;nb_placement=&amp;amp;nb_li_ms=&amp;amp;nb_lp_ms=&amp;amp;nb_fii=&amp;amp;nb_ap=&amp;amp;nb_mt=&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22337365570&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD-FZK9B6OIDoYxlnJHekH0S-GwyR&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwgvnCBhCqARIsADBLZoKM5PDla-ZnP7gOLWAyBpZyt7eVPbIFAV6jp38g9OFpegCLMoF0a84aAgF4EALw_wcB"&gt;more tactical-looking ones&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to go with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088NV9P1F?linkCode=ssc&amp;amp;tag=onamzmarycl08-20&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B088NV9P1F&amp;amp;asc_item-id=amzn1.ideas.1TSCBFDJDM6LX&amp;amp;ref_=aip_sf_list_spv_ofs_mixed_d_asin&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c20709aam__cmcuxhsm9000l0idp0byl2ayk__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;$30 Prodigen vest&lt;/a&gt; that Haver includes in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/drmaryclairehaver/list/1TSCBFDJDM6LX?ref_=aip_sf_list_spv_ofs_mixed_d&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c20709aam__cmcuxhsm9000l0idp0byl2ayk__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;her Amazon Storefront&lt;/a&gt; (yes, she earns a commission). She recommends starting with a vest that’s around 5 percent of your body weight and eventually working up to 10 percent. My last pregnancy made my back sore enough that I could barely walk, so I decided to start conservatively with 8 pounds. However, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theashleywill/video/7485779628435541279?q=weighted%20vest&amp;amp;t=1751040610575"&gt;plenty of women on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; say they quickly leveled up to 16- and 20-pound vests.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxkx8p002e3b77k0vfglrx@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;My vest arrived a few days later in a compact but heavy cardboard box. When I tried it on, it was surprisingly comfortable. There was something invigorating about wearing it. I suddenly wanted to stand up straighter and engage my core, like &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@flauntshe_/video/7485832370612981038?q=weighted%20vest&amp;amp;t=1751984427181"&gt;the TikTok videos advise&lt;/a&gt;. But it was definitely dorky looking. “You’re going to wear &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; on a walk?” my husband asked, smirking.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxl4ih002l3b77ewmv9h03@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;I generally try to avoid wearing things that call attention to themselves, especially when I’m exercising, so I was dreading wearing my vest out of the house. For my first outing, I was relieved it was drizzling so I could hide the vest under a raincoat while I walked to the grocery store. But it was bulky enough that I still felt ridiculous, especially inside the store, where I had to be extra careful not to accidentally bump into someone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxl4ih002m3b77vrva4a8c@published" data-word-count="101"&gt;I quickly decided the vest was too embarrassing to wear while running errands. It felt weird to wear it with anything besides workout clothes, and the raised sleeves also make it annoying to carry a tote bag. But it didn’t seem to be making my back sore, so I started taking it on longer walks. After an hour of pushing the stroller on a 90-degree day, taking off the vest felt great. But at the same time, walking around with an extra eight pounds wasn’t&lt;em&gt; that&lt;/em&gt; hard. Was it really doing anything? I wondered whether I should buy a heavier one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxl4ih002n3b77c1s2mfda@published" data-word-count="93"&gt;Going for a walk and listening to a podcast is usually one of my favorite activities. But while pages of Amazon reviewers gush about how much they love their vests, I mostly found it tedious. The extra weight made me feel constrained and awkward in a way that reminded me of pregnancy or walking with a baby carrier. It didn’t take long for me to start to resent the vest lying on the floor next to the front door, nagging me to make every trip out of the house a little less enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxlm9b00333b77l13dw456@published" data-word-count="63"&gt;As it turns out, my weighted vest probably wasn’t&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;doing much. “It’s being marketed as a one-stop fitness solution that is good for bone health and has benefits for muscle, and you can get those benefits from going on a couple of 30-minute walks per week,” says Lauren Colenso-Semple, a muscle physiology researcher at McMaster University. “But the evidence just does not support that.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxls9900393b77nway4j06@published" data-word-count="119"&gt;Colenso-Semple points out that most of the studies influencers cite to illustrate the benefits of the vests actually don’t involve walking. For example, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10995045/"&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt; that Haver references when she claims that &lt;a href="https://thepauselife.com/blogs/the-pause-blog/weighted-vests-for-bone-and-muscle-strength?srsltid=AfmBOoprRXqYZKJ_kSqW-gj78Lm7rDHnePS6bYN4cFkRk3m3gDnr2Tki"&gt;weighted vests can help improve bone strength&lt;/a&gt; looked at women who wore vests while jumping. It’s a relevant distinction, since experts say high-impact exercise — like jumping — is beneficial for maintaining bone density (as opposed to walking, which is low impact). “There’s only one study that I’m aware of that looked at walking,” says Colenso-Semple, referring to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22338922/"&gt;a 2011 paper&lt;/a&gt; that looked at 48 women and found no difference (for bone health or otherwise) between women who walked with a weighted vest and those who walked without one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxls9a003a3b777j8b6ye3@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;It’s worth noting that &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKhgKemAswE/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=1"&gt;both of these studies are very small&lt;/a&gt; — as are most of the studies cited by influencers pushing weighted vests. “I’m not saying it &lt;em&gt;doesn’t &lt;/em&gt;work, but the actual evidence is quite limited,” says Lora Giangregorio, a researcher in bone health and exercise science at the University of Waterloo who thinks walking in a weighted vest is “a waste of time.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxm2mt003l3b77l9rmics2@published" data-word-count="142"&gt;While weighted vests were initially pitched as a way for menopausal women to get stronger, it didn’t take long for women on TikTok to start claiming that adding one to their daily walk helped them &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kymberlychase/video/7515579949223316767?q=weighted%20vest%20weight%20loss%20&amp;amp;t=1751298137873"&gt;lose 30 pounds&lt;/a&gt;. But while wearing a vest might help you burn a few more calories — assuming it’s not so heavy that it slows you down — it does not appear to be a magic weight-loss hack. Colenso-Semple points out that in one &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32510046/"&gt;commonly cited study&lt;/a&gt;, participants wore a weighted vest for eight hours a day. Even then, people who wore a vest that was 11 percent of their body weight only lost 1.6 kilograms — about 3.5 pounds. Another study, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30095153/"&gt;in which participants tried to wear a vest for ten hours&lt;/a&gt; a day, found no additional benefit for weight loss — though some people did report a sore back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxm8ka003r3b77vtx55zn8@published" data-word-count="44"&gt;Obviously, walking with a weighted vest can make it more challenging. But Giangregorio says that if your goal is to increase cardiovascular fitness, there are plenty of other, potentially more satisfying ways to do that, like walking on an incline, walking faster, or jogging.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxn10a00423b77kmkw6f4h@published" data-word-count="87"&gt;If your goal is to build muscle, there’s no shortcut around strength training, says Colenso-Semple. “You can use dumbbells, you can use machines, you can use barbells — but there has to be some resistance,” she says. Experts say that wearing the vest could be helpful to add resistance while you’re doing squats or lunges. But even then, the amount of weight you could reasonably add with a weighted vest might not be challenging enough, since to build muscle, you need to make the exercise harder over time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxn5ru00483b77j56m935z@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;“The key is to pick a version of the exercise that’s quite challenging, so you can only do somewhere between six and 12 reps,” says Giangregorio. “That’s a much more efficient way to build muscle than doing an activity you can do for 30 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxnerm004j3b77na14bbci@published" data-word-count="36"&gt;Definitely not. Personally, I’m thrilled to return to walking around unburdened by extra weight, and I’ll stick to jogging when I want something harder. This experiment did motivate me to do a few more push-ups, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic &lt;strong&gt;insomnia&lt;/strong&gt; is a condition that affects millions around the world, with treatments usually revolving around medications or lifestyle changes. But what if a simple, &lt;strong&gt;natural solution&lt;/strong&gt; could offer better results than the typical remedies? A recent study suggests that the answer might lie in an unexpected place: &lt;strong&gt;sex&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New Study Challenges Traditional Sleep Aids&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/46/Supplement_1/A179/7181852?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, researchers have found that &lt;strong&gt;sexual activity&lt;/strong&gt; could be more effective than traditional &lt;strong&gt;sleeping pills&lt;/strong&gt; in improving sleep quality. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/why-do-we-wake-up-every-night-around-3-or-4-am/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="71992" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Insomnia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a common issue, with around 13% of the population in &lt;strong&gt;France&lt;/strong&gt; suffering from the condition. &lt;strong&gt;Women&lt;/strong&gt; are particularly affected, with 16.9% of women reporting chronic sleep problems, compared to just 9.1% of men. Despite the availability of &lt;strong&gt;sleeping pills&lt;/strong&gt;, many individuals still struggle to get the rest they need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Douglas Kirsch&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;sleep specialist&lt;/strong&gt;, and his team sought to explore an alternative method for improving sleep: sex. The team’s findings show that sexual activity, especially when accompanied by &lt;strong&gt;orgasm&lt;/strong&gt;, might trigger &lt;strong&gt;natural processes&lt;/strong&gt; in the body that promote relaxation and a better night’s sleep. This raises the intriguing possibility that &lt;strong&gt;sex&lt;/strong&gt; could be a natural remedy that rivals medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Closer Look at the Findings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted with &lt;strong&gt;53 adults&lt;/strong&gt;, predominantly between the ages of 25 and 49, with &lt;strong&gt;53%&lt;/strong&gt; of participants being women. Each participant completed a survey that assessed the impact of sex on their sleep quality, and the results were compelling. &lt;strong&gt;Seventy-five percent&lt;/strong&gt; of respondents reported &lt;strong&gt;sleeping better&lt;/strong&gt; after engaging in sex, with many indicating that their sleep improved significantly on nights following sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, a large portion of participants—around &lt;strong&gt;64%&lt;/strong&gt;—reported that &lt;strong&gt;sex&lt;/strong&gt; was as effective, or even more effective, than traditional sleeping pills. This is a notable finding, as many individuals turn to medication as their first line of defense against &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/why-we-sleep-more-but-feel-more-tired-than-our-prehistoric-ancestors-and-why-were-paying-for-it/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="83669" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sleep issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, these results suggest that a &lt;strong&gt;natural alternative&lt;/strong&gt; may provide comparable, if not superior, results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Physiological Link Between Orgasm and Better Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that the key to this effect may lie in the &lt;strong&gt;physiological processes&lt;/strong&gt; that occur during &lt;strong&gt;orgasm&lt;/strong&gt;. During sexual activity, the body releases a number of &lt;strong&gt;hormones&lt;/strong&gt;, including &lt;strong&gt;oxytocin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;endorphins&lt;/strong&gt;, which are known to promote feelings of relaxation and well-being. These hormones are often referred to as “&lt;strong&gt;feel-good&lt;/strong&gt;” chemicals and are responsible for the calming effects people feel after sexual activity. The release of these hormones might help to alleviate &lt;strong&gt;stress&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;, making it easier for individuals to fall asleep and stay asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, Dr. Kirsch and his team caution that the study’s &lt;strong&gt;observational nature&lt;/strong&gt; means that further research is required to definitively understand the link between sex and sleep. They also note that this research did not delve into the &lt;strong&gt;psychological aspects&lt;/strong&gt; of sex, particularly for individuals with negative associations with intimacy. In such cases, the effects on sleep could differ, and the study does not address the potential for trauma or discomfort in certain individuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Limitations and the Need for Further Research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the findings of this study are promising, experts stress that more comprehensive research is necessary to fully understand the &lt;strong&gt;mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt; at play. The study was observational and based on &lt;strong&gt;self-reported data&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning the results could be influenced by individual perceptions and biases. In addition, the sample size was relatively small, with only 53 participants. Future studies will need to include larger and more diverse groups to verify whether these results can be generalized to a broader population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the study does not explore the impact of &lt;strong&gt;emotional intimacy&lt;/strong&gt; between partners on sleep quality, which could play a significant role. It’s possible that couples who are emotionally close might experience different sleep benefits from sex compared to those who are not. Additionally, the study did not consider the &lt;strong&gt;long-term effects&lt;/strong&gt; of using sex as a sleep aid, which would be an important avenue for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

Her charisma and ability to connect with people eventually led her to Bloomingdale’s, where she was hired to interview patrons during breakfast events; a unique role that catapulted her into the media spotlight. Her warm interactions and natural curiosity became the foundation for “The Sally Froelich Show,” a talk show that aired for over 20 years, engaging audiences with candid conversations and relatable topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The guests would talk to me, and the audience would ask questions. It was a lot of fun,” as reported by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Healthline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;TV host Froelich joins ‘&lt;keyword id="27710578" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="SuperAgers-study" source="keywords"&gt;SuperAgers study&lt;/keyword&gt;’ to explore the science behind &lt;keyword id="21332343" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="healthy-aging" source="keywords"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the many topics she explored on her show, one series remains especially close to Froelich’s heart: “The Vital Years.” Launched when she was around 60 years old, the series focused on the challenges and joys of aging in later adulthood — including second marriages, staying active, health concerns, and grandparenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, these conversations feel more relevant than ever, as Froelich participates in an innovative research project aiming to unlock the secrets of healthy aging. Froelich is one of 600 participants in the SuperAgers Family Study, run by the American Federation for Aging Research. This study is no small effort — it seeks to enroll 10,000 individuals aged 95 and older who are in good physical and cognitive health. But it’s not just about the SuperAgers themselves. The study also includes their adult children and the spouses of those children who don’t have SuperAger parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;95 year old woman shares 9 secrets to a long, healthy life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she may have longevity genes on her side, Froelich also practices many of the healthy lifestyle habits recommended by experts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I eat three meals a day. I don’t overeat,” she says. A balanced diet helps maintain energy, weight, and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She never smoked and drinks only in moderation. Research shows smokers are three times more likely to die prematurely of cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froelich proudly notes that her weight hasn’t changed in 50 years, even though her body shape has. This stability helps reduce strain on joints and organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lifelong sports enthusiast, she continues to golf 2–3 times a week and exercises six days a week — including stretching, sit-ups, and weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froelich keeps her mind sharp with bridge, audiobooks, and TV. Mental stimulation supports cognitive health and memory as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She dines out weekly, sees her children regularly, and checks in with her grandchildren via Zoom. Social interaction is linked to lower rates of depression and dementia. “If I’ve been hanging around the house a lot, I just go out and walk around the block,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her advice? “Do what you want to do and things that make you happy. Eat ice cream and delicious chocolate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Keep your hair done, your nails done… and have someone tell you if anything looks off,” she says. Looking after your appearance can boost mood and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reframe how you think about aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that positive perceptions of aging can extend life by up to 7.5 years. “It’s not just about living longer — it’s about living better,” says Dr. Leipzig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why SuperAgers and their children hold the key to healthy aging&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are just as important as the SuperAgers because we need to draw comparisons in the frequency of the genes,” said Dr. Sofiya Milman, Director of Human Longevity Studies at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal? To discover which genes are responsible for helping people live long, healthy, and disease-free lives. Past research suggests that certain genes may play a key role in exceptional longevity — including those that influence HDL cholesterol and growth hormone regulation. Dr. Milman and her team have found that genetics often outweigh lifestyle factors when it comes to reaching the age of 95 and beyond. “We found that [SuperAgers] didn’t differ in smoking, alcohol use, diet, or exercise compared to their peers — and yet, they lived significantly longer,” Milman explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How healthy habits can delay age-related diseases&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you didn’t win the genetic lottery, lifestyle choices remain critically important. While only 0.1% of Americans live to age 95 or older, the rest of the population can still dramatically reduce the risk of age-related diseases by adopting healthy habits. “It’s unlikely that a healthy lifestyle alone will get you to 95,” said Milman, “but it can delay the onset of illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Rosanne Leipzig, geriatrician and author of Honest Aging, genetics account for about 20–40% of longevity, while the remaining 60–80% is shaped by your environment and life experiences — including your childhood nutrition, education, access to healthcare, and even the neighborhood you grew up in. She also highlights the concept of “weathering” — the idea that chronic stress from systemic disadvantage, particularly among African American women, can impact long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/waking-up-with-a-headache-it-could-be-a-silent-sign-of-high-bp-experts-warn/articleshow/122337397.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Waking up with a headache?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The deceased: &lt;/strong&gt;A 39-year-old woman in Belgrade, Serbia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The discovery:&lt;/strong&gt; The woman's ex-husband found the woman's body in her apartment and notified the police. She was lying on her left side on the living room couch, and her body was covered by a blanket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;Police removed the blanket to examine the body; the woman was naked from the waist down. There were no visible signs of violence or injury. The police then discovered an object protruding from the woman's bottom: a spring twirl whisk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its wooden handle had been inserted into her anus to a depth of about 4 inches (10 centimeters), penetrating her anus and rectum as "a dildo-like object," doctors wrote in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22104332/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22104332/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. According to the ex-husband, the woman had high blood pressure, also known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;arterial hypertension&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for which she was taking medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The autopsy findings: &lt;/strong&gt;An examination of the woman's cranium revealed a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17871-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-sah" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17871-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-sah" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;subarachnoid hemorrhage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — bleeding in the space between the brain and a layer of tissue surrounding it. Blood had pooled to a depth of up to 0.2 inches (6 millimeters) around the base of the brain and the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When medical examiners cleared out the blood clots, they discovered a ruptured saccular aneurysm, a blood-filled sphere that ballooned from a blood vessel in the brain. This is also known as a "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20361483" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20361483" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;berry aneurysm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" for its resemblance to a round berry dangling from a stem, and it is the most common type of aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aneurysm measured 0.4 inches (11 millimeters) in diameter and had popped at the top of its dome. When aneurysms rupture, they release blood that can kill nearby brain cells and increase pressure inside the skull. As pressure builds, the flow of oxygen and blood to the brain may be disrupted, which can lead to unconsciousness and death. Aneurysms are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bafound.org/news/why-women-are-more-likely-to-have-brain-aneurysm-than-men/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bafound.org/news/why-women-are-more-likely-to-have-brain-aneurysm-than-men/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more common in women&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than in men, especially in women with low estrogen levels, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.STR.30.7.1390" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.STR.30.7.1390" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;postmenopausal women&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

In the woman's case, her partial nudity, body posture and the presence of the whisk suggested that she was using the kitchen tool for anal self-stimulation, the report's authors wrote. Her sexual excitement and subsequent orgasm could have temporarily caused her blood pressure to spike enough to rupture the aneurysm, causing a fatal hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Sexual activity is not a common cause of sudden death. In prior studies that evaluated a total of nearly 130,000 forensic autopsies, 195 of the deaths (0.15%) were linked to sex, and only a fraction of the deceased were women. When someone dies during or shortly after intercourse, it is usually an older male with a much younger female partner, and the cause of death is typically abrupt cardiac failure, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women, sudden death during sex is often caused by a subarachnoid hemorrhage from a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557867/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557867/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;burst saccular aneurysm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, this is the first case to present such a scenario for a woman's death during anal self-stimulation, the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-vUxPYREazuekiwTUExwDcZ-ZuGJm9Oaze5yNJrrIu8QZNwtDG5k0HHt" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-vUxPYREazuekiwTUExwDcZ-ZuGJm9Oaze5yNJrrIu8QZNwtDG5k0HHt slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            The approval of the first &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/africa/malaria-us-foreign-aid-cuts-africa-intl"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; treatment for newborns and young infants could lead to imminent widespread use in Africa, drugmaker Novartis said Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The drug, known as Coartem Baby or Riamet Baby in some countries, has been approved by Swiss authorities for use in babies weighing between 2 kilograms (4 pounds, 6 ounces) and 5 kilograms (11 pounds) and is formulated to be easy for them to take, Novartis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcup7o7u00013b6m90xet236@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coartem Baby already has approval in the West African nation of Ghana and Novartis said it now expects eight African countries to grant their own approvals within 90 days. The countries – Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda – also participated in the assessment of the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Vas Narasimhan, chief executive of Novartis, said in a news release that this first clinically proven malaria treatment for newborns and young babies ensures “even the smallest and most vulnerable can finally receive the care they deserve.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Until now, the smallest babies have been treated for malaria, a potentially deadly disease spread by mosquitoes, with medications designed for older children. Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceutical corporation behind the newly approved drug, says this can expose newborns to the risk of overdose and toxicity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfax0005356n3mnljtaw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most clinical trials have historically excluded babies under six months old,” Novartis spokesman Ruairidh Villar told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There were 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths in 2023 – nearly all of them in Africa, according to World Health Organization data. Children under the age of 5 accounted for about three in four malaria deaths in the region.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The medicine was developed by Novartis in collaboration with the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), a Switzerland-based not-for-profit organization.

            Novartis told CNN that it plans to “roll out the medicine in the coming weeks on a largely not-for-profit basis.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Malaria is one of the world’s deadliest diseases, particularly among children. But with the right resources and focus, it can be eliminated,” said Martin Fitchet, chief executive of MMV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The approval of Coartem Baby provides a necessary medicine with an optimized dose to treat an otherwise neglected group of patients and offers a valuable addition to the antimalarial toolbox.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

                Phillipa Munari suffered nerve pain and exhaustion after she stopped taking antidepressants. She struggled to train her horse, Bella, and "could barely walk because of the withdrawal," said Munari. "I spent 20 hours in bed most days for two years."

   &lt;p&gt;Phillipa Munari started antidepressants in 2003. Her doctor recommended one, she said, after she complained of feeling tired. She didn't think it helped, but she kept taking it anyway. When she decided to stop taking the drug 10 years later, her doctor helped her taper off it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, this went fine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And then, six to nine months later, I started feeling horrible," she said. "I had nerve pain. My neck and shoulders were sore all the time. My anxiety was through the roof." These were symptoms Munari had never experienced before.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Munari, who lives in New Brunswick, Canada, said she became so exhausted and physically weak she found it difficult to continue her job at a call center. She spent much of the next two years in bed. To receive disability, she agreed to go back on the drug she'd been on, Effexor. She then weaned off it again, this time much more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The nerve pain and exhaustion gradually improved, she said, but the anxiety got worse.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I had complete panic. I couldn't leave the house," she said. Driving in the car, she said, "I'd be in the passenger seat with my eyes closed." It took two more years before things began to improve, she said in an interview as she choked up&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Munari is one of the tens of thousands of people who have turned to online forums to discuss lasting health problems after going off antidepressants. Many say their doctors didn't warn them this could happen, and didn't believe them when they said they were having a problem.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Doctors have long understood that stopping antidepressants can cause short-term withdrawal, with patients &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12602_discontinuation-symptoms-treatment-serotonin-reuptake.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;suffering from symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like dizziness, anxiety, insomnia and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What most prescribers and patients don't understand is that "you can have symptoms that persist for long periods after you stop them," said British psychiatrist Mark Horowitz, who specializes in antidepressant withdrawal. According to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489088/" target="_blank"&gt;one analysis&lt;/a&gt; of patient narratives, people who experienced long-term withdrawal suffered for an average of eight years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although psychiatrists have been documenting cases like Munari's for decades, no large-scale studies on the problem exist. Because of that, experts still disagree on how common this kind of condition is, how to prevent it, or even what to call it.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It should be very concerning to the medical system and the public that there are tens of millions of people walking around on drugs whose long-term exposure and withdrawal effects we do not understand," Horowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, survivors of antidepressant withdrawal and related conditions are coming together online and pushing for education, research and recognition. They say prescribers must inform themselves about these issues and warn patients about them before starting or keeping them on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'Before I took it, I had feelings'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-76668" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                After spending 13 years on antidepressants, Sven Huber, from western Germany, had lasting problems after stopping the drugs.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Sven Huber found himself Googling depression symptoms in 2009 after reading media coverage of a German soccer player's suicide that November. The symptoms, he said, "fit on me."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber, a 35-year-old living in western Germany, spent the next 13 years on antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His doctor first prescribed him one drug, which helped with his depression but made him sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber said he then switched to escitalopram (marketed as Lexapro), but that one was even worse. The day after he started it, Huber said, his genitals went numb and his emotions became blunted. He lost his libido, his vision went blurry, his feet felt like they were burning, and his cognition and short-term memory became unreliable, he said. "It felt like a switch was flipped," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber's doctor recommended he wean off the medication over a few weeks. But immediately, Huber began experiencing sensations like electrical shocks in his head, known in psychiatry as "brain zaps." He grew anxious, confused, and had suicidal thoughts he'd never had before. All of these are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32259826/" target="_blank"&gt;documented symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of antidepressant withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know is in crisis, contact the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; via call, text or chat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber went back on the escitalopram. It seemed he had to choose: Endure extreme side effects or excruciating withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For nine years, Huber struggled to taper off the drugs, failing to quit them five times. Finally, a year and a half ago, he took his last dose.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The brain zaps, anxiety and suicidal thoughts all resolved, he said, but the blurry vision, burning feet, sexual dysfunction and emotional numbness persisted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I can't relate to any family members or friends," he said. "Before I took it, I had feelings – bad feelings often – but I felt something. And now I do not feel anything at all."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This emptiness, he said, is the hardest to bear. "I would just like to feel like a human," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Side effects that may never go away&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lasting problems after withdrawal like Huber's probably occur very infrequently, estimates Nassir Ghaemi, a prominent psychiatrist and professor at Tufts University's School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would say it's an unknown minority of patients who may have this kind of side effect long term," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But doctors who specialize in antidepressant withdrawal say the true risk of severe and lasting symptoms may be obscured by the fact that many patients try and fail to stop the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've never seen anybody come off long-term Effexor or Cymbalta and not have years of trouble," said Horowitz, the British psychiatrist. While these two drugs are known to be harder to stop, Horowitz said he also frequently sees severe and lasting problems among patients coming off drugs with less risk for withdrawal, like fluoxetine (marketed as Prozac) and escitalopram.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some people, Horowitz said, these symptoms only begin after stopping the drug, while for others, the symptoms begin like side effects during treatment and get worse after stopping.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While patients and researchers often refer to lasting symptoms as "protracted withdrawal," Horowitz and other specialists have suggested terms like "serotonin-induced neurological dysfunction" or "antidepressant withdrawal injury" as umbrella terms for the phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178125001453?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; the longer someone stays on antidepressants, the more likely they are to suffer from severe and long-lasting conditions after stopping them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Ghaemi and Horowitz both said it's important for anyone considering it not to stop antidepressants cold turkey, but rather to carefully taper off of them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Antidepressants can be helpful for short-term relief, said Ghaemi. But for depression, they are most effective in the first six months of use, he said, and "shouldn't be given routinely for years and decades. I think that's where we're running into problems." For certain conditions, he adds, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, long-term use may be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, which makes Cymbalta and Prozac, and AbbVie which makes Lexapro, declined to comment for this story. APM Reports and NPR could not reach Viatris, which makes Effexor for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'That's historic'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber was relieved to learn he wasn't alone when he discovered online forums full of people with stories like his, he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit page&lt;/a&gt; geared specifically toward people with PSSD, or post-SSRI sexual dysfunction, people talk about having "genital anesthesia" and no libido while taking and after stopping antidepressants. Many also share the emotional numbness Huber described, saying they can no longer experience love, joy or pleasure, a phenomenon doctors call anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reading these, "I knew I wasn't crazy," Huber said. But it was scary to learn how long people were suffering for, and that there wasn't a cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That page has grown from 700 to 16,000 subscribers over the past five years. Other groups have grown too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A forum called &lt;a href="http://survivingantidepressants.org" target="_blank"&gt;Surviving Antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; has 23,000 members. A Facebook group that helps users taper off the antidepressant Cymbalta has 43,000 members.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Many more exist on different platforms, for specific drugs and in various languages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While pharmaceutical companies have poured billions into efforts to show antidepressants work, relatively few studies have explored the drugs' negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Frustrated by the absence of research, advocates are lobbying governments and the medical establishment to fund studies that could reveal the conditions' prevalence, causes, and possible cures. Some patients are spending their own money on research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The nonprofit PSSD Network has raised more than $200,000 for research over the past two years, which it directs to a research team at the University of Milan, in Italy. And in response to pressure from the Canadian PSSD Society, the Canadian government recently began funding research into PSSD through small grants through the University of British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's historic," Nick Alves, a spokesperson for the PSSD Network said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;about this kind of institutional involvement. "That's huge."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another organization, the &lt;a href="https://antidepressantinfo.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Antidepressant Coalition for Education&lt;/a&gt;, is pushing people to report their withdrawal experiences to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-76669" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                After experiencing seven years of withdrawal symptoms from Paxil, Adele Framer started an online community forum in 2011.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'People don't learn this stuff in medical school'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adele Framer started the online forum Surviving Antidepressants in 2011, following seven years of withdrawal symptoms after quitting an antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the website, volunteer moderators share best practices for tapering, often referring to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Maudsley-Guidelines-prescribing-Prescribing/dp/111982298X" target="_blank"&gt;handbook&lt;/a&gt; for doctors written by Horowitz, the British psychiatrist. His method of reducing one's dose gradually – by 10% of the previous dose each month over a year or more, for example – differs dramatically from the standard medical guidance of tapering over a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Framer has worked with researchers to extract patient narratives from the forum into data that can be analyzed. This data has been used in many published studies. For example, one sought to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489088/" target="_blank"&gt;establish the duration&lt;/a&gt; and common symptoms of protracted withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's a hidden public health problem in people experiencing withdrawal symptoms because they and their doctors don't know how to gradually reduce the dosage," she said, and "people don't learn this stuff in medical school."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Recently, Framer has turned her attention to a new endeavor: a nonprofit called the Psychotropic Deprescribing Council, which she founded in 2023. The council's goals are to develop best practices for tapering off psychotropic medications to minimize risk of withdrawal symptoms and relapse, and to inform clinicians about them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And now, the influential American Psychiatric Association appears to be paying attention. Dr. Alan Schatzberg, a Stanford psychiatrist and consultant to the APA, said he thinks depression is worse than withdrawal symptoms, and warned "we would not want people not to take the medications."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But because the group received complaints about PSSD from patients, he said, the APA's research council has begun to review the literature on PSSD and other lasting problems from antidepressants. It will publish the results.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz, the British psychiatrist, said he welcomes the APA's interest, but a review of the literature will likely be inadequate. "When you do a review, you're only reviewing what exists," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;existing studies on modern antidepressants, known as SSRIs and SNRIs, weren't designed to assess withdrawal or long-term use.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz said he'd like to see government-funded research that follows long-term antidepressant users' experiences after they stop the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Whether this is likely in the U.S. is uncertain. On the one hand, Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an outspoken critic of antidepressants. On the other hand, the Trump administration has cut federal funding for biomedical research as well as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/06/nx-s1-5424670/rfk-jr-samhsa-mental-health-addiction-overdose-trump-budget-cuts" target="_blank"&gt;staffing at federal health agencies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz said he believes the APA's literature review is a sign patients and advocates are being heard.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you’re watching your blood sugar, it’s easy to assume pasta is off the menu.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;However, some types of pasta are rich in blood sugar–leveling protein and fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We asked dietitians the best pasta for healthy blood sugar. They unanimously said chickpea pasta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A warm, saucy bowl of pasta can instantly transport your taste buds to a place of bliss. But if you’re watching your blood sugar, you may have heard that pasta shouldn’t be a nightly event. So, we asked four registered dietitians to share the best pasta for blood sugar management, and they all said the exact same thing: chickpea pasta. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Chickpea pasta is an excellent selection because it’s made from legumes, [which provide] a combination of carbohydrates, protein and fiber,” says diabetes educator &lt;a href="https://www.amysnutritionkitchen.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Kimberlain, M.S., RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. “This combination helps slow down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, resulting in a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels compared to a rapid increase.” Skeptical about its taste? Even die-hard purists may not notice the swap. Chickpea pasta looks, cooks and tastes surprisingly like traditional pasta. But it has multiple nutritional advantages and blood sugar benefits. Read on, as we dig into why chickpea pasta gets the thumbs-up for better blood sugar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-chickpea-pasta-is-our-1-pick-for-better-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Chickpea Pasta Is Our #1 Pick for Better Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; High in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether it's spaghetti, penne or farfalle, traditional pasta is typically made of durum wheat flour. Because it’s refined, it contains quickly digested carbohydrates that are low in fiber. This can cause your blood sugar to spike, especially if pasta is the only thing in your bowl. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chickpea pasta, on the other hand, is made from chickpeas (aka garbanzo beans). Yes, it contains carbs. However, it also provides blood sugar–stabilizing fiber and protein. “Chickpea pasta delivers significantly more fiber than traditional refined wheat pasta, and this fiber helps slow digestion and the release of glucose into the bloodstream,” explains &lt;a href="http://www.healthbysapna.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sapna Peruvemba, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ashleyhawkrd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ashley Hawk, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, is also a fan of adding fiber to your pasta bowl. “I like to think of fiber as the traffic controller for your digestion. It helps slow down how quickly food breaks down and sugar hits your bloodstream,” she explains. And chickpea pasta is filled with it. Two ounces of dry, uncooked chickpea pasta provides an impressive 8 grams of fiber. That’s roughly 30% of your daily requirement in one small serving and more than four times the amount in a similar-size serving of traditional pasta.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rich in Plant Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chickpea pasta also contains good-for-you plant-based protein. “Even though you’re still getting a good amount of carbohydrates from chickpea pasta, the protein content in it can help stabilize blood sugar levels by slowing glucose absorption,” says Peruvemba. A standard 2-ounce serving of uncooked chickpea pasta packs about 11 grams of protein. That’s nearly 60% more than the 7 grams you’d get from regular pasta. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to chickpea pasta’s hefty protein content, there’s no need to add chicken, fish or shrimp to your dish to up its protein. Chickpea pasta’s plant protein may be especially advantageous when you’re watching your blood sugar. Research shows that consuming more animal protein may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Conversely, swapping in plant-based protein like the kind in chickpea pasta has been found to improve insulin sensitivity, help with weight management and lower overall diabetes risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports Healthy Gut Bacteria  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turns out what you feed your gut impacts far more than just your digestive health. It can influence your entire body, including your blood sugar. “The fiber found in chickpea pasta can act as a prebiotic in the body, which helps feed the good bacteria in the gut,” explains &lt;a href="https://freshcommunications.com/team/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samantha MacLeod, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Feeding the good bacteria can help promote a healthy microbiome, which studies have shown can improve blood sugar control.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the other hand, research has found that an imbalance in gut bacteria can lead to poor blood sugar regulation and increased insulin resistance. The prebiotic fibers in chickpea pasta may help cultivate a healthy microbiome, which may lead to improved gut health, glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Has a Low Glycemic Index &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The glycemic index (GI) measures how quickly a food raises your blood sugar levels. How does it work? Carbohydrate-containing foods are assigned a number on the GI scale. Those with lower numbers tend to promote a slower, steadier glucose release, while higher numbers are associated with rapid increases in blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; ”Foods with a lower GI, like chickpea pasta, break down more slowly, helping prevent sharp spikes and crashes. It’s one reason why this swap feels just as satisfying but leaves you feeling better long after the meal,” says Hawk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As helpful as chickpea pasta is for preventing these spikes, there’s a trick to make it even better: eat it cold in a chickpea pasta salad. The reason? Cooling pasta in the fridge after cooking alters its starch composition for the better, significantly lowering its GI.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experts agree you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have your cake—er, we mean pasta—and eat it too! Even if you choose traditional or whole-wheat pasta, there are ways you can enjoy all types of pasta and keep your blood sugar in a healthy range. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Below, our experts share their top tips to enjoy pasta without the sugar spike. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy It as a Side Dish: &lt;/strong&gt;Many people pile their bowls high with pasta for a main dish. However, Kimberlain recommends serving it as a side dish instead. Aim for a 2-ounce portion of dried pasta, which is roughly 1 cooked cup. Feel free to bulk it up by mixing in lots of nonstarchy veggies and a lean protein.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Up on Veggies&lt;/strong&gt;: Every dietitian we spoke to recommended loading your pasta bowl with plenty of veggies. “Always include veggies—whether stirred into the pasta or served on the side,” says Peruvemba. Their fiber helps slow down digestion and keeps blood sugar levels in a happy range. From raw to sautéed, roasted or grilled, the possibilities are endless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add in Protein: &lt;/strong&gt;Protein helps increase satiety and prevents jumps in blood sugar. Toss chicken, shrimp, salmon, ground turkey, beans or lentils into your pasta or enjoy them as a side dish with your pasta. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Forget Healthy Fats: &lt;/strong&gt;Fat helps you absorb fat-soluble vitamins, supports satiety and prevents blood sugar spikes. Peruvemba recommends drizzling either tahini, olive oil or a nut-based pesto over your pasta for healthy fats. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Your Own Sauce: &lt;/strong&gt;Skip the jarred or canned sauce and try this easy at-home version: “Simmer canned no-salt-added crushed tomatoes with garlic, a pinch of dried oregano, fresh basil and a drizzle of olive oil,” says Hawk. “It’s a simple way to cut back on sodium and added sugars that can sneak into store-bought sauces.” Plus, it only takes about 10 minutes to make!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Four out of four dietitians agree that chickpea pasta is the No. 1 pasta for better blood sugar. It’s high in fiber, packed with plant-based protein, supports gut health and has a low glycemic index, which all help with blood sugar management. If you’re wondering if it’s still OK to have a little traditional pasta, the answer is yes. To keep blood sugar in check, dietitians recommend small portions of pasta enhanced with plenty of blood sugar–stabilizing nonstarchy veggies, lean protein and healthy fats. Nutrition pros are also big fans of whipping up your own pasta sauce to reduce added sugars and sodium. With these tips, you can build a balanced, blood sugar–friendly pasta meal no matter which noodles you choose.&lt;br&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;Not everyone loves dark chocolate, but it loves you. This bitter-tasting treat is another magnesium hack for better-regulated adrenal glands. In fact, &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170273/nutrients" target="_blank"&gt;according to the USDA&lt;/a&gt;, a 100g bar contains a staggering 228mg of magnesium — a dosage that’s not far off your &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/magnesium-dosage#migraines" target="_blank"&gt;maximum daily allowance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

Well, that depends on your personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My personality is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“enjoys cake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;”.&lt;/strong&gt; That doesn’t sound very scientifically thorough, but it’s a start. Do you enjoy exercise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the basis that I’m not a masochist, no, of course not.&lt;/strong&gt; Interesting. And why is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, what if I’m at the gym and all the big men look at me?&lt;/strong&gt; In that case I have good news and bad news. The good news is that you fit an established archetype. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250708045648.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; has determined that people with higher levels of neuroticism are less likely to exercise regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me more about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; University College London invited 132 volunteers to follow an eight-week exercise course, with questionnaires to fill in about their enjoyment levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who doesn’t love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a sweaty questionnaire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; After that, they had their personalities assessed to see if they generally exhibited signs of extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism or openness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And all the neurotics hated the exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; Kind of. All the neurotics felt shy about exercising in front of other people, and preferred to do light workouts in short bursts away from everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the others? &lt;/strong&gt;Those who scored highly in extroversion loved high-intensity training such as weightlifting or spin classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, a scientific explanation for why spin classes are so obnoxious.&lt;/strong&gt; However, they didn’t have the best overall fitness. That went to those who scored highly in conscientiousness, because they possessed a better understanding of the long-term benefits of regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside from underlining how awful extroverts are, what’s the point of all this? &lt;/strong&gt;Well, it’s understood that exercise is good for you. But perhaps the reason why people don’t do it is because they’re picking the wrong exercise for their personality type. When was the last time you went to the gym?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Several years ago. There were lots of big men, and potentially some of them were aware of my existence.&lt;/strong&gt; So that isn’t the right exercise type for your personality. What if you bought some resistance bands and worked out at home every morning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, maybe I’d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; stick to that.&lt;/strong&gt; There we go. And you should, especially if you consider yourself neurotic. The study showed that, of all the five main personality types, neurotics were the only group who experienced a significant reduction of stress after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So exercise might make me less neurotic?&lt;/strong&gt; It’s certainly a possibility. And who knows, if you really start enjoying it, you might even become a little bit of an extrovert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m going back to bed.&lt;/strong&gt; I suppose that’s understandable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do say:&lt;/strong&gt; “I should pick a workout that matches my personality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t say: &lt;/strong&gt;“I hear that cowering at the state of the world burns a ton of calories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOME54LTE0eTQwVXYtRWlpemtEbU1jZTk4STVZX0xpYnlhajFJN3RqQnRpaXNBbkVaTG13Nmkxd2JPWGE1QnNWdk94ZGxGc0xxRnFiZklmdGxTbjRHV1I4OG9LVzRDcHlLa0twOTJHaUdwRkNtQ1FYOV8wTXRwQzFYLUNIX3JSLXA3dmRkTTRhcWtpSXRDcmM0bUdwVlRFTXAwODhkRnN6TzUycmdXWF9TNU9mQVRMZHFGeXFfYVV6ZVl1UQ</guid></item><item><title>根据医生的说法，每天一杯葡萄酒如何影响你的心脏- Earth.com | How a glass of wine a day affects your heart, according to doctors - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOeURwODVZT0JLbFB6UXFDYzBoNXNsRU9uWXNWWE0xQ2dXSldCai0wOHR1NVQtblBLUUdkeDhpUjRUYVNPTzBWbzFETVRqeDB6eE5EN3QyTUctbmQ4ZmduT1k5WEthREJsNklOMlo4YVFyeWNSNXg3NmthYVdoR2l2MjF1cVNkaUZaMTZzX2JEZHFFbjZoanlyVA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people toast the end of the day with a five‑ounce glass of wine, hoping that ritual keeps heart trouble at bay. Two new analyses suggest the habit might offer real – if limited – protection for adults already at higher risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest evidence comes from a Spanish arm of the long‑running &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28684083/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PREDIMED trial&lt;/a&gt;. The study tracked 1,232 older adults following a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and found that those who averaged roughly half to one glass per day had significantly lower heart risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five years, their risk of heart attack, stroke, or cardiac death dropped by nearly half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers verified intake by measuring wine‑derived tartaric acid in urine instead of relying on memory, a switch that turned vague drink logs into hard numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by &lt;a href="https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en/professionals/ramon-estruch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Ramon Estruch&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://web.ub.edu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hospital Clinic Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chemical-reveals-true-wine-intake"&gt;Chemical reveals true wine intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questionnaires often miss what people actually pour, so scientists struggle to pin down alcohol’s true effects. Using the &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2311-7524/9/11/1173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;grape‑exclusive metabolite tartaric acid&lt;/a&gt; makes it possible to see how much wine someone enjoyed over the previous week without asking them to confess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By measuring tartaric acid in the urine, alongside food and drink questionnaires, we have been able to make a more accurate measurement of wine consumption,” said Estruch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study linked tartaric acid levels to self-reported wine intake, confirming it as a reliable consumption marker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wine-s-effects-in-mediterranean-diets"&gt;Wine’s effects in Mediterranean diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting such objective tools may help resolve decades of conflicting findings that swing from “red wine is medicine” to “no amount is safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators also adjusted for smoking, exercise, and other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/to-get-fit-and-stay-healthy-walk-this-exact-distance-every-day/"&gt;lifestyle habits&lt;/a&gt;, so the reduced risk cannot be written off as a simple marker of healthier living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, tartaric acid only captures wine, not beer or spirits, letting researchers isolate how fermented &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hidden-chemistry-of-wine-what-actually-shapes-its-texture/"&gt;grape products&lt;/a&gt; behave inside a diet already rich in extra‑virgin olive oil, fish, and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That context matters because many of wine’s plant compounds appear to interact with the broader Mediterranean plate, enhancing their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healing-chronic-wounds-with-gold-and-red-wine/"&gt;antioxidant reach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefits-tied-to-small-servings"&gt;Benefits tied to small servings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who logged between three and thirty‑five five‑ounce glasses a month, roughly half to one serving a day, saw their risk of a major cardiac event fall by 50 percent. Light users who stayed below half a glass a day gained a 38 percent cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once intake climbed above one glass each day, the advantage disappeared and, in some analyses, reversed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern mirrors American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt;, which caps daily wine at one five‑ounce serving for women and two for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men, who made up just under half the study group, appeared to draw a stronger benefit. However, statisticians caution that the sex difference may fade in larger samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even within the favorable range, nurses warned that pouring size matters because many home glasses hold eight or nine ounces, inadvertently nudging people past the safer ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-makes-wine-different"&gt;What makes wine different&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wine carries a mix of polyphenols such as resveratrol, quercetin, and catechins that seem to boost the lining of blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34119624/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; report that supplemental resveratrol can improve endothelial function, a key factor in healthy blood pressure and clot prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red wine has more antioxidants due to skin fermentation, though white wine still provides some. That biochemical cocktail may partly explain why studies often find beer or spirits lack the same signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate alcohol itself can raise high-density lipoprotein (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/about/ldl-and-hdl-cholesterol-and-triglycerides.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HDL&lt;/a&gt;), the so‑called “good” cholesterol, yet ethanol also raises triglycerides and blood pressure at larger doses. Polyphenols may tilt the equation back toward benefit, but only within a narrow window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-too-much-wine-harms-the-heart"&gt;Too much wine harms the heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 systematic &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2802963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that pooled data from 4.8 million people found no reduction in all‑cause mortality among moderate drinkers once misclassified former drinkers were excluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors warned that earlier optimism probably stemmed from comparing social drinkers with people who quit because of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy pouring is indisputably harmful. Even &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2023/07/31/even-just-1-alcoholic-drink-a-day-may-increase-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one extra daily drink&lt;/a&gt; can raise systolic blood pressure by two to four millimeters of mercury, a change large enough to push many people into hypertension. Elevated pressure strains arteries, sets the stage for arrhythmias, and accelerates heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alcoholresearchforum.org/members/giovanni-de-gaetano/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Giovanni de Gaetano&lt;/a&gt; noted that the biomarker approach “provides robust evidence that moderate wine consumption is associated with lower CVD risk. He cautioned that the same data “remind us of the risks associated with higher levels of consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol also carries addictive potential, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that roughly &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2014/p0626-excessive-drinking.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one in ten deaths&lt;/a&gt; among working‑age adults is tied to excessive drinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sobering statistic explains why public health agencies repeat that zero is the only completely risk‑free dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wine-humans-and-heart-health"&gt;Wine, humans, and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adults older than about 35 who already follow a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, a small glass of wine with supper may fit comfortably into a heart‑conscious lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are pregnant, taking interacting medications, or battling addiction should not take the PREDIMED results as a green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrients that give wine its appeal, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/moderate-wine-consumption-reduces-cardiovascular-risks/"&gt;including resveratrol&lt;/a&gt;, also reside in grapes, blueberries, nuts, and olive oil. Anyone who chooses to skip alcohol can still obtain similar antioxidant support without ethanol’s downsides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians emphasize that no one should start drinking for health reasons. Instead, the sensible takeaway is that very modest wine, enjoyed with meals and within established limits, is unlikely to harm. It might even help certain high‑risk adults when paired with vegetables, fish, and extra‑virgin olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/46/2/161/7920812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 00:14:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOeURwODVZT0JLbFB6UXFDYzBoNXNsRU9uWXNWWE0xQ2dXSldCai0wOHR1NVQtblBLUUdkeDhpUjRUYVNPTzBWbzFETVRqeDB6eE5EN3QyTUctbmQ4ZmduT1k5WEthREJsNklOMlo4YVFyeWNSNXg3NmthYVdoR2l2MjF1cVNkaUZaMTZzX2JEZHFFbjZoanlyVA</guid></item><item><title>“老年人气味”、肺癌风险和早晨锻炼警告-福克斯新闻 | 'Old people smell,' lung cancer risks and morning workout warnings - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQdXBHdEJoNW12bjYwcVVCaU9qYkpDZ25aU0x3WUFaWVBmeEZKSHlqemhheFNwTVljTHFJRVlQaXJBNmRwRjl2ZVB4QVR4U19kQ2dSTklsVHFqZmc5M3cwckM3X0NETWg1eEY5NUsyblYzT19rdUVENW9td25yeDB2NDRsbjA5dzNEb1ZQeXp3bGlPc21z0gGaAUFVX3lxTFBCLS1jTHRrV1lpTGRZMEhoSC0yOVU2NmF1a2JrVjc1YUZsaDk5X0hNUGxUbEx0SnNjSjFSYzdkTXFSaUpveXNIRjlENFpGV0o4WTFaYjVjVkk2NW1iV0NYQjB0QldjMDcxcmNjVlBPUHBSWkdXN1lWdllnbjJWN3ZrcGZvQ0xJelVKNVRFNWRWYmE5NEdtblYwcVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fox News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 23:43:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQdXBHdEJoNW12bjYwcVVCaU9qYkpDZ25aU0x3WUFaWVBmeEZKSHlqemhheFNwTVljTHFJRVlQaXJBNmRwRjl2ZVB4QVR4U19kQ2dSTklsVHFqZmc5M3cwckM3X0NETWg1eEY5NUsyblYzT19rdUVENW9td25yeDB2NDRsbjA5dzNEb1ZQeXp3bGlPc21z0gGaAUFVX3lxTFBCLS1jTHRrV1lpTGRZMEhoSC0yOVU2NmF1a2JrVjc1YUZsaDk5X0hNUGxUbEx0SnNjSjFSYzdkTXFSaUpveXNIRjlENFpGV0o4WTFaYjVjVkk2NW1iV0NYQjB0QldjMDcxcmNjVlBPUHBSWkdXN1lWdllnbjJWN3ZrcGZvQ0xJelVKNVRFNWRWYmE5NEdtblYwcVE</guid></item><item><title>根据一项新的研究- EatingWell ，如果您患有糖尿病，您应该摄入的被低估的蛋白质 | The Underrated Proteins You Should Be Eating If You Have Diabetes, According to a New Study - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTFA3dDQ0azh6a1A4alhFUlJVdkdzY24xa1VMR05MdHJCT1E2Y0VoOXdpY19VOEpOYmN1LTBXT2gtNHJHcUdtZVROalY4MTRXRUJiMHlwMklGREtnc3dSeURRZDZvZlhCRGQwR0NXNmdRVnRqbms?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have diabetes, you know that protein is essential to help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-stable-blood-sugar-11758681" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stabilize your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;.

Plant protein, however, has been shown to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-and-worst-foods-for-kidneys-11762971" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;prevent or slow down kidney function decline&lt;/a&gt;. With that said, the evidence is inconclusive, and the 2022 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative states that there is not enough conclusive evidence to recommend one type of protein over another.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this reason, the Initiative lumps all types together and recommends that people with diabetes or kidney disease who are not on dialysis restrict their protein intake to 0.8 g/kg of ideal body weight per day. This is also a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;general recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for people without diabetes, though that recommendation may be too low for some people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from Taiwan wanted to take a closer look at &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;proteins and amino acids&lt;/a&gt;—the building blocks of protein— and their associations with diabetic kidney disease. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers recruited 378 participants with type 2 diabetes; half were women with an average age of 63. Based on urine tests, participants were split into two groups: those with just diabetes and those with diabetic kidney disease. Of the 378 participants, 237 were categorized as having diabetes without kidney disease, and 141 met the criteria for kidney disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Through structured interviews with registered dietitians, participants completed 24-hour dietary recalls and food frequency questionnaires at baseline. From their responses, protein amount and types were calculated. They were then placed into one of three categories based on their protein consumption: less than 0.8 grams per kilogram of ideal body weight (Group 1),&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;0.9-1.2 g/kg (Group 2) and more than 1.3 g/kg (Group 3). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Also at baseline, demographics like age, sex, diabetes duration and medication use were captured, along with BMI and waist circumference. Blood pressure was measured, and bloodwork was done for fasting glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and microalbuminuria. Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), both screenings for kidney disease, were calculated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Group 1, which had the lowest overall protein intake, also had the lowest mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (78), followed by Group 2 (85) and Group 3 (87). Typically, a normal eGFR is 90 or higher, and 89 to 60 indicates mild loss of kidney function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Group 1’s serum creatinine levels also suggested lower renal (kidney) function; they also had the highest fasting blood glucose levels, HbA1c (an average of blood glucose over three months) and microalbumin levels (UACR). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers then broke down types of protein into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/should-you-be-taking-an-essential-amino-acid-supplement-11715877" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt;. Amino acids are what proteins are made of. There are 20 primary amino acids necessary for humans, nine of which are essential amino acids. They’re essential because we need to get them from food, as our bodies cannot make them. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What surfaced after statistical analyses were run was that higher overall protein intake, as well as higher intake of certain amino acids—branched-chain (BCAA), aromatic (AAA) and ketogenic amino acids—were all independently associated with a lower risk of diabetic kidney disease. In particular, leucine and lysine, two essential amino acids, were most strongly associated with a lower risk of diabetic kidney disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers concluded that for non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients, in addition to the recommended total protein intake, the balance of amino acid patterns should be considered. They suggest that supplementation with branched-chain amino acids and histidine, and restriction of tyrosine, methionine and glutamic acid—all amino acids found in higher concentrations in meat—may serve as nutritional strategies to support kidney function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Study authors note that their findings align with previous studies, suggesting that ketogenic amino acids, in particular, leucine and lysine, may help protect against diabetic kidney disease. While found in many foods, leucine and lysine are abundant in: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dairy, like milk, yogurt and cheese&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fish and seafood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legumes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeds and nuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meat, like pork, chicken, turkey, venison, bison and lean beef&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soy products, like tempeh, tofu and edamame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains, like quinoa, buckwheat and amaranth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As you can see, it’s a nice mix of animal and plant proteins that contain these essential amino acids. Whether you have diabetes or not, it’s important to include a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-protein-vegetarian-foods-11762306" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety of protein-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant proteins&lt;/a&gt; are definitely worth prioritizing, as they often include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044305/best-high-fiber-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;fiber and healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to incorporate more plant-based proteins but aren’t sure where to start, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7960416/vegetarian-meal-plan-for-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;7-Day Vegetarian Meal Plan for Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s loaded with tasty, plant-based meals and snacks, with some dairy and eggs sprinkled in.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have diabetes and struggle with maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, consider how much protein you’re eating. Fiber is another &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/two-surprising-nutrients-may-impact-blood-sugar-11718212" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;important nutrient for controlling blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, and it works even better when combined with protein. Many sources of plant protein will offer both of those nutrients. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/misconception-about-protein-survey-11701426" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Combining animal proteins with a plant source&lt;/a&gt; is another great way to get protein and fiber into your day. For example, yogurt with fruit and nuts or tuna with veggies are filling, tasty options.

They’re twice as likely to be affected as men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now scientists say they may be on their way to understanding why that’s the case - pinpointing two stark differences between men and women. Firstly, women have different chromosomes than men. They &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-wellbeing/menopause-symptoms-alzheimers-dementia-b2745425.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:also undergo menopause;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;also undergo menopause&lt;/a&gt;: a process that occurs when a woman’s reproductive hormones naturally decline starting in her 40s and 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One in three older Americans dies with Alzheimer's, or another dementia, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;. Almost two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer’s disease are women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Epidemiologically, we see that for almost all neurological diseases, there are differences in how many biological women and men are affected,” Anna Bonkhoff, resident and research fellow in neurology at Harvard Medical School and Mass General Brigham, explained in a recent &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/07/why-are-women-twice-as-likely-to-develop-alzheimers-as-men/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interview;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s a tendency, for example, in [multiple sclerosis] and migraine for more females to be affected, while it’s the contrary for brain tumors and Parkinson’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Just based on these numbers, you get the feeling that something needs to underlie these differences in terms of the biology,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease as men. Now researchers are working to nail down why (Getty Images/iStock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Looking inside the body, while women have two “X” chromosomes, men have an “X” and a “Y.” Chromosomes are thread-like structures of DNA inside our cells that &lt;a href="https://kidshealth.org/ChildrensWI/en/kids/word-chromosomes.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:carry hundreds or even thousands of genes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;carry hundreds or even thousands of genes&lt;/a&gt;. Genes determine a person’s physical characteristics. Differences between genes held on the X and Y chromosomes may give women an increased chance of developing Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Recent research has shown that &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2823160" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:genes on the X chromosome are related to Alzheimer’s disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;genes on the X chromosome are related to Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, including that &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/757913" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:women with Alzheimer’s live longer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;women with Alzheimer’s live longer&lt;/a&gt; than men with the disease due to their second X chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A lot of genes for the immune system and regulating brain structure are located on the X chromosome, so the dosages differ to certain degrees between men and women. That seems to have an effect,” said Bonkhoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Women’s different dominant hormones — such as estrogen, which acts on the brain — could also play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Menopause is part of the puzzle, probably one of the bigger ones,” Bonkhoff said. “I’m not saying it’s the only one — aging is relevant by itself, and there’s a lot of interesting research looking at what aging does to the immune system that seems to have implications for cognitive changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During menopause, when ovaries stop producing estrogen and progesterone, some women turn to hormone replacement therapy. The practice offers relief for symptoms of lower hormone levels in menopause such as hot flashes. But for some women it may increase their risk of dangerous medical conditions, including heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, blood clots and gall bladder disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/womens-health-topics/menopause" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopause is ‘part of the puzzle,’ researchers say. People who received hormone replacement therapy to alleviate symptoms of menopause exhibited one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (Getty Images/iStock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Women who received hormone replacement after age 70 also have significantly higher levels of the protein known as “tau,” according to Rachel Buckley, associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.

Pushpa Narayan speaks to Dr Vijay Viswanathan, president of the Research Society for the Study of Diabetes in India (RSSDI), about how these wearables are helping in diabetes management. Take a look...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How good are CGMs at monitoring blood sugar levels?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These wearables give real-time information about glucose levels, providing greater insight into the body’s sugar trends than traditional finger-prick tests. CGMs can show how different foods, exercise, sleep, and stress impact a person’s glucose levels 24x7. This data helps doctors offer dietary and medicinal adjustments to optimise blood sugar levels. Some studies suggest CGMs can detect early signs of impaired glucose tolerance or prediabetes even in those with normal HbA1c (2-3 month blood sugar average) levels. Also, the feedback can motivate people with diabetes to adopt healthier lifestyle choices such as regular physical activity and balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Did You Know? Mangoes Are Low On Calories And Supports Heart Health!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When do you recommend them?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In specific cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, I had a patient whose HbA1c was 6.1, which is very good control for a person with diabetes, but the fasting and postprandial (after a meal) sugar levels were extremely high. We found it was possibly because my patient had been eating mangoes almost every day. HbA1c is the gold standard but doesn’t reveal glucose fluctuations that occur throughout the day. A normal HbA1c with frequent low and high blood sugar indicates wide swings that the average doesn’t capture. A high HbA1c despite ‘good’ clinic readings could mean post-meal spikes or overnight high sugar that are not being captured by intermittent testing. We recommend a CGM when a patient’s average might be masking significant glycemic variability. It provides the timing, magnitude, and frequency of fluctuations, allowing doctors to pinpoint the root cause of disparity and adjust meal plans and medical treatment accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are they tools to improve diagnosis?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. For instance, the Somogyi phenomenon or rebound hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and the Dawn phenomenon are two distinct causes of high morning blood sugar in people with diabetes. Somogyi phenomenon occurs when an episode of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) during the night triggers the release of counter-regulatory hormones such as glucagon, cortisol, and epinephrine which work to raise blood sugar. In diabetics who lack sufficient insulin, this mechanism can overshoot, leading to high blood sugar levels in the morning. Dawn phenomenon is a more natural process where the hormones cause a blood sugar rise between 2am and 8am to prepare for waking. These hormones increase insulin resistance and signal the liver to produce more glucose. In those without diabetes, the pancreas releases enough insulin but not in diabetics, leading to elevated blood sugar levels upon waking. Unlike Somogyi phenomenon, Dawn phenomenon is not preceded by a hypoglycemic event. It’s important to distinguish between the two as treatment varies. CGMs help the caregiver diagnose, adjust insulin dosage and medication timing, with better long-term health outcomes and lower risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="_oWMq   "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information overload can cause anxiety, unwarranted dietary restrictions, and sometimes an unhealthy obsession with food among healthy folk. Not to mention needless expense&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="DuPus"&gt;Dr Viswanathan&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Even healthy people are using CGMs as a predictive health tool to prevent diabetes. Would you recommend it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors’ bodies, including RSSDI, are cautious about recommending widespread use in healthy people as the need is not yet proven. Also, most devices have algorithms tailored only to a diabetic’s needs, which can lead to data misinterpretation. There’s also the danger of an information overload that can cause anxiety, unwarranted dietary restrictions, and sometimes an unhealthy obsession with eating among healthy folk. Not to mention the needless spending. That said, manufacturers have designed over-the-counter devices for those who don’t use insulin and are not at severe risk of low blood sugar. For healthy people, I would recommend a balanced diet, exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight for glucose management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can CGMs help kids and the elderly?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They greatly reduce the need for painful finger-prick tests that kids may dislike and the elderly may have difficulty with. Both may be more susceptible to hypoglycemia and may not experience typical symptoms. A CGM can provide life-saving alerts for low glucose that would help prevent severe episodes. And modern CGMs are often user-friendly, which can benefit older adults with cognitive impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-gFBVV95cUxQRXZzQUhZRzJrV2JuN2pPampMVEljSENiU2UzNFd5NWhBNWloWGZ3YkhnYTZyak96VDhHYnhSeU5yNFVqRTNnek5uOWtjUmhDdUt1WEZpdzVSVlp1bmxYcGpuQ0dEblh6Zkw5bkJPcXRBWllYcU96cDZqNHU2bWhyTThIT1NZcXFYNVpaQlVITGE5YWRVMjFhYmpVNUJBM1dzbHBCanNVZG1vUTF0UXJpRWZZZ2FCSHNTNWo3YjUwUmdiaGNPVmQ0QjYxOWoyODNWZFZTSDBjZDRnejRfN29tUm5tQ01vTFZlYXlIZFc4VDVpd1JYaHdwMk1R0gH_AUFVX3lxTE5LelBvcDNGeXAwX2w2M1htNVNLR05yakFfVzlVZW91eU9FcllqQWV0NV9iV3ZZSWJSZDUwaVpaWF9lc2Q0TVMtTXNicnFlSDJlc0ZpNW1seTNPWTFJR1ZKMm1xZHJ4clRTSE5lOE5mWDVpWElDNFNsQVVJMGVoY0JDRjdkeWpUd2FrUzdUamdoX3lVYzZxS1Fva25tWUdWWTBiZ0xlRG1LQlZtZWx6UnJSUEllczEwenhCTVo5N1RQWGpWMTR5RUZLeFNRbnRBZ2k4dGE0UWd0aTk4SDgwdXRGaTI5QlMtVS1RVmYwbVdCeXdzQ2l4a2RscU1SVnhyZw</guid></item><item><title>我以为这只是一个痘痘。实际诊断结果让我大吃一惊。- AOL.com | I Thought It Was Just A Zit.

For months, I thought nothing of it. But then the spot started turning red last December. “Maybe it’s just a pimple,” I thought to myself. A week went by. Then another. And another. The &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a19953557/bumps-you-should-never-pop/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:annoying bump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;annoying bump&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t changing in size, color, or tenderness like a normal zit would—and I was starting to get a little worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This peculiar blemish was painless, but it wasn’t showing any signs of fading and I didn’t like how it looked. So, I figured I’d bring it up to my dermatologist, &lt;a href="https://www.drkhorasani.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hooman Khorasani;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hooman Khorasani&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a dermatologic and cosmetic surgeon in private practice in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dr. Khorasani examined the spot under a microscope, he thought it looked a little suspicious because he could see blood vessels that aren’t normally visible in certain &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a60360644/acne-types/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:types of acne;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;types of acne&lt;/a&gt;. He didn’t immediately assume it was something serious like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a60687451/the-current-state-of-skin-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:skin cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;skin cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because I was only 31 years old at the time, and incidences of skin cancer rise sharply in those who are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6969010/#:~:text=of%20the%20authors.-,Risk%20Factors,12%2C%2016%E2%80%9321%5D." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:75 or older;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;75 or older&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But to be on the safe side, Dr. Khorasani collected a small piece of skin tissue and sent it to a lab to be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All I had to do was wait for him to contact me with the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the phone rang, my heart sank.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was sitting at my desk in my Manhattan office building finishing up a day of work as a marketing professional in the beauty industry when Dr. Khorasani called and told me that the mysterious spot on my forehead was actually &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19949282/basal-cell-carcinoma/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:basal cell carcinoma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;basal cell carcinoma&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer/about/what-is-basal-and-squamous-cell.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the most common form of skin cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the most common form of skin cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He explained that this type of cancer results from mutations in skin cells called keratinocytes. These mutations can be sporadic and happen randomly, but they’re often caused by exposure to UV radiation from the sun, or artificial radiation from &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61898762/gen-z-tanning-bed-trend-risks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tanning beds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tanning beds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing that I had “the Big C” was scary, but I felt like I was in good hands with Dr. Khorasani. He reassured me that we caught the lesion early and that the prognosis of basal cell carcinoma is excellent. We made an appointment to surgically remove the spot a couple weeks after I was diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is never a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; time to get cancer. But my diagnosis came during a particularly hectic time in my personal and professional lives. For one, I had just married my husband, Sam, in September, and we were really looking forward to a mini honeymoon in Tulum, Mexico, in early February. Knowing I'd still be healing with my forehead covered with bandages, we decided to postpone the trip by several weeks. Around the same time, I was also given a thrilling opportunity to represent my company at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. But like my upcoming vacation, I had to back out and stay home in Brooklyn to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was scared to have a scar on my forehead forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheduling conflicts weren't the only thing that made my diagnosis frustrating. Even in the hands of one of the world’s top dermatologic and cosmetic surgeons, I still dreaded the permanent scar I would have on my forehead. After all, it’s not a spot that’s particularly easy to conceal from others. But come January 28th, Dr. Khorasani performed what’s called a Mohs micrographic surgery on my face. The procedure is done in stages, meaning Dr. Khorasani removed the cancerous skin cells bit by bit to ensure he spared the surrounding healthy tissue and minimized the size of the scar left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Emily Haley the day she had surgery to remove basal cell carcinoma from her forehead.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Emily Haley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure took about five hours and, all things considered, it was pretty easy and painless for me. What came after that took a larger toll: I was forced to wear white gauze on my forehead in the weeks following my surgery, and it was really awkward to explain why I looked the way I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of my scar and the various bandages covering it naturally drew attention, but not necessarily the kind I wanted. I didn’t always feel like explaining myself or revealing that I had been dealing with cancer. However, I’m comforted by the fact that this phase in my life won’t last forever. And that’s because in the weeks and months following my procedure, Dr. Khorasani has—and continues—to perform several procedures to help improve the appearance of my scar. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dermabrasion and CO₂ laser resurfacing&lt;/strong&gt;: Dermabrasion gently polishes the outermost surface of the scar to help smooth out any uneven texture. And CO₂ laser resurfacing uses a beam of light to precisely remove tiny columns of skin. When that skin heals, more collagen is produced which helps the scar tissue more closely resemble normal skin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vascular laser treatment&lt;/strong&gt;: This procedure involves using a beam of light to target and remove blood vessels in the skin, which reduces unwanted redness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bellafill injections&lt;/strong&gt;: These gel injections help correct contour abnormalities from the scar, like raised areas or indentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Botox: &lt;/strong&gt;This injection helps relax the muscles in the forehead so they don't pull on the incision and stretch the scar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the healing process since the surgery hasn’t always been picture-perfect (my scar looks especially red immediately after treatments) but on good days, I’m happy to say that you’d hardly know the scar is there thanks to all the help from my doctor and his team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skin cancer is a risk for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom has olive skin, but I inherited my father’s fair complexion, which &lt;a href="https://www.skincancer.org/risk-factors/skin-type/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:naturally raises my risk of skin cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;naturally raises my risk of skin cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and makes sun care all the more important. Some people can also inherit &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/skin/hp/skin-genetics-pdq" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:certain genes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;certain genes&lt;/a&gt; that raise their risk of developing the disease. So growing up, my parents drilled into me the importance of wearing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64760024/facts-about-sunscreen/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sunscreen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sunscreen&lt;/a&gt;, not just while lounging on the beach in the summer, but every day, all year round. And despite spending most of my childhood indoors, at a dance studio in my hometown in Wisconsin, applying the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a46277622/how-much-sunscreen-to-use-on-your-face/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:right amount of sunscreen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;right amount of sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; multiple times a day was second nature to my family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, my mom developed basal cell carcinoma on her chest when she was in her 60s, which was about seven or eight years ago. And when I was a child, my dad developed precancerous skin growths when he was in his 50s. My family history combined with my alabaster skin made it feel almost unavoidable that I’d face a similar fate. But in an attempt to protect myself, I stuck to my sunscreen routine, never used &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61898762/gen-z-tanning-bed-trend-risks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tanning beds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tanning beds&lt;/a&gt;, and visited a dermatologist annually for skin cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing basal cell carcinoma despite my good habits (and getting diagnosed decades earlier in life than my parents) came as a shock. It was a stark reminder that skin cancer can happen to &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve become a hat girly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since my diagnosis, I’ve become even more diligent about protecting my skin. Like always, I make sure to apply (and re-apply) sunscreen throughout the day, using products with an SPF of at least 35, as my doctor recommends. And my day-to-day plans don't determine whether I protect my skin. It doesn’t matter if I’m going for a long walk under the sun or leaving my home for a quick grocery run on a rainy day. Wearing sunscreen is like brushing my teeth—a non-negotiable part of my daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when I know that I’ll be spending some extra time outdoors, I do like to take extra precautions. During my trip to Tulum, for instance, I wore rash guards while lounging by the pool and beach, and I spent a lot of time hanging out in a cabana rather than exposing myself to direct sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also now visit my dermatologist for cancer screenings every six months instead of annually, as is recommended by the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer/after-treatment/follow-up.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Cancer Society.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And I plan to pay for &lt;a href="https://molesafe.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:skin cancer surveillance services;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;skin cancer surveillance services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; once a year. The clinic I go to uses artificial intelligence to analyze high-quality photos of my whole body to determine whether I’ve developed any cancerous moles. But perhaps the most fun change in my life has been learning how to embrace wearing protective hats. Sun hats, baseball caps, bucket hats, you name it! Hats that offer coverage from the sun are a new staple of my personal style. And I’m enjoying experimenting and incorporating them into my outfits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Emily Haley enjoying her vacation in Tulum, Mexico, while protecting her skin.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Emily Haley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of walking around with various hats and scar coverings, I no longer worry what other people think of me or how I look. When someone asks about my scar, I’m happy to share my story. Because if opening up helps even one person catch something early, protect their skin, or feel less alone, then it’s all been worth it. And in the meantime?

New research published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr8015" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; shows that the brain dynamically adjusts how much effort it devotes to each item based on its importance. By tracking brain activity while people remembered two locations on a screen, scientists discovered that two brain regions—the visual cortex and the frontal cortex—work together to allocate more resources to items deemed more important. This results in sharper, more precise memory for high-priority items, while low-priority ones are remembered with less clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Hsin-Hung Li at The Ohio State University, wanted to understand how the brain deals with the fact that working memory is limited. Working memory helps us temporarily store information we need for things like making decisions, solving problems, or navigating the world. But it can only hold a small amount of information at a time. Past studies have shown that people can improve their memory for important items by prioritizing them. But scientists did not know how the brain manages this internally or what parts of the brain make those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this, the researchers developed a method to measure how the brain represents multiple items held in memory at once and how it adjusts those representations based on priority. They combined functional MRI brain scans with a sophisticated computational model that could decode what participants were remembering—and how precisely they were remembering it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment involved 11 participants who each took part in several scanning sessions. While lying in an MRI scanner, participants looked at a screen where two colored lines appeared briefly—each in a different half of the screen. Before the lines appeared, a cue indicated which side of the screen was more likely to be tested later, marking one of the items as high-priority and the other as low-priority. After the lines disappeared, participants had to wait 12 seconds while trying to remember their locations. Then, they were prompted to look with their eyes at the location of one of the items, using a quick eye movement known as a saccade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most trials, the high-priority item was the one tested, but in a smaller number of trials, the low-priority item was selected instead. Eye-tracking data allowed researchers to measure how accurate each memory was, depending on whether it was high or low in priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that participants were consistently better at remembering the high-priority item. Their eye movements landed closer to the correct location, and they responded more quickly when recalling high-priority information. These results confirmed that people can adjust their memory performance based on what they think will matter most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What made this study unique was its ability to decode brain activity related to each memory item—separately and in real time. Using a model rooted in a theory called probabilistic population coding, the team translated patterns of brain activity in the visual cortex into predictions about what the participant was remembering and how certain their brain was about it. They showed that high-priority items were encoded with more “gain,” meaning the brain devoted more neural resources to representing them. These representations were not only stronger but also more precise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing data from both the visual and frontal areas of the brain, the researchers were able to go a step further. They found that activity in the frontal cortex predicted how much emphasis was placed on the high-priority item. The frontal cortex didn’t store the memory itself, but it seemed to decide which item deserved more attention. Once that decision was made, it influenced how the visual cortex represented each item. This suggests a kind of top-down control: the frontal cortex acts like a manager, telling the visual system how to distribute limited memory resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In trials where the high-priority item received more gain in the visual cortex, participants made fewer mistakes when recalling it. The researchers also showed that when the brain was less certain about an item—reflected by more “noisy” neural activity—participants took longer to respond and were more likely to make errors. This indicated a strong link between the brain’s internal sense of certainty and actual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also identified a specific part of the frontal cortex, the superior precentral sulcus, as playing a key role in prioritization. Activity in this region increased when participants were allocating more memory resources to the high-priority item. Its activity also predicted quicker response times, especially when participants felt more certain about the remembered location. In addition, the researchers found involvement from parts of the parietal cortex and a region in the temporal lobe called the posterior inferior temporal cortex—areas that are known to participate in attention and visual processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results help clarify how different brain regions coordinate to prioritize memories, the study had some limitations. The sample size was relatively small, with only 11 participants, which may limit how generalizable the findings are. The tasks were also highly controlled and may not reflect how working memory operates in everyday settings where people remember many types of information at once, not just spatial locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that although the researchers could estimate how much “gain” was assigned to each item, they could not directly measure how this translated into specific neural firing rates at the level of individual neurons. Future studies might combine brain imaging with methods that can capture more detailed neural activity to get a fuller picture of how memory prioritization works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with these caveats, the study offers a new way to look at working memory. It suggests that rather than being a fixed bucket that can only hold a few items, working memory is a flexible system that can shift resources from one item to another depending on its relevance. The frontal cortex helps manage this process by signaling which memories deserve more attention, while the visual cortex adjusts how clearly those memories are encoded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Hsin-Hung Li noted that this is one of the first studies to decode the brain’s memory for two different items on a single trial. He believes this technique could be useful for exploring many situations where people try to hold multiple thoughts in their minds at once. “There are so many situations in which people are trying to hold multiple thoughts in their minds and it is very useful to be able decode more than one,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr8015" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Neural mechanisms of resource allocation in working memory&lt;/a&gt;,” Hsin- Hung Li, Thomas C.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A compound found in psychedelic mushrooms may have antiaging properties. Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine have found that psilocybin, the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms, may extend both cellular and organismal lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;npj Aging&lt;/i&gt;, show that psilocybin reduced multiple hallmarks of aging in cells while also improving survival in aged mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There have been a number of clinical studies that have explored the therapeutic potential of psilocybin in psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety; however, few studies have evaluated its impacts outside the brain," said Dr. Louise Hecker, associate professor of medicine—&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cardiovascular+research/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cardiovascular research&lt;/a&gt; at Baylor and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The overwhelming majority of what we know about psilocybin is how it impacts the brain. Our findings suggest that psilocybin has potent effects on the entire body, including antiaging properties, which also may contribute to the plethora of observed beneficial clinical outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telomeres, the protective caps of repetitive DNA sequences located at the ends of chromosomes, shorten as we age—telomere shortening is a classic hallmark of aging. Hecker's research suggests that psilocybin treatment preserves telomere length, which contributes to cellular life extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current study, using human cells, the team found that psilocybin extended cellular lifespan by up to 57% depending on dosages. In cells, psilocin (the active metabolite of psilocybin) delayed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cellular+senescence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cellular senescence&lt;/a&gt;, preserved telomere length and reduced oxidative stress levels. Their findings also suggest it leads to increased SIRT1 expression, which is associated with regulating longevity, as well as other cellular markers indicating improved DNA damage responses.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The study also showed that when psilocybin was administered to aged mice (the equivalent to a 60-year-old in human age), mice showed significantly improved survival compared to control mice. Researchers also noted a visible improvement in fur quality, which suggests healthier aging, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a very exciting and clinically relevant finding that suggests that even when intervention is initiated late in life, it can have dramatic impacts," said Dr. Kosuke Kato, lead author of the study and assistant professor of medicine—pulmonary at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings open an exciting new chapter in psychedelic research beyond its neurological and psychological benefits," Hecker said. "Psilocybin may represent a disruptive agent that promotes healthy aging. The next steps need to explore the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/therapeutic+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;therapeutic effects&lt;/a&gt; across multiple age-related diseases."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is important to note that additional research is needed to validate these findings in human studies," Kato said. "There is still a lot to understand, including optimal dosing protocols that will lead to maximal efficacy. We also need to better understand the potential risks of long-term psilocybin treatment before this type of treatment is ready for public use."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once validated in human studies, the use of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psilocybin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/a&gt; could offer new options for healthy aging and potentially age-associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that leisure-time activities like yoga or team sports tend to improve mood more than obligatory tasks like housework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors such as social interactions, environment, and even instructor style can profoundly influence how exercise affects mental well-being. The findings suggest that tailoring exercise to personal preferences and settings may enhance its positive impact on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context Counts:&lt;/strong&gt; Social setting, purpose, and enjoyment of exercise shape its mental health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leisure Wins:&lt;/strong&gt; Voluntary activities show stronger effects than obligatory or stressful exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tailored Approach:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding personal and situational factors can improve outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Georgia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research often points to exercise as a good way to boost mental health, but a recent study from the University of Georgia suggests that it’s not just physical movement that affects mental health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s how, where and why you exercise that makes the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Historically, physical activity research has focused on how long someone exercises for or how many calories were burned,” said Patrick O’Connor, co-author of the study and a professor in the Mary Frances Early College of Education’s Department of Kinesiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111462"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-300x233.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-770x599.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-293x228.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-150x117.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and people exercising." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-300x233.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-770x599.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-293x228.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/exercise-mental-health-neurosiccenc-150x117.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The same physical activity can feel very different depending on who the activity was done with, as well as where, when and how. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ‘dose’ of exercise has been the dominant way researchers have tried to understand how physical activity might influence mental health, while often ignoring whether those minutes were spent exercising with a friend or as part of a game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research shows that leisure-time physical activity — like going for a run, taking a yoga class or biking for fun — correlates with better mental health outcomes, these benefits may vary significantly depending on the environment and circumstances surrounding the activity, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To analyze these factors, the researchers reviewed three types of studies. These included large-scale epidemiological studies that examined health patterns in populations, randomized controlled trials where some groups received exercise treatments and others did not, and a much smaller but growing set of investigations into contextual factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise and mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple studies found that people who engage in regular leisure-time physical activity tend to report lower levels of depression and anxiety. But it’s less clear for other forms of activity like cleaning the house or working for a lawn care company. The context may matter as much as the intensity or amount of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, if a soccer player runs down the field and kicks the game-winning ball, their mental health is fantastic,” O’Connor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast, if you do the exact same exercise but miss the goal and people are blaming you, you likely feel very differently. Anecdotes such as these show how context matters even when people are performing a similar exercise dose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous randomized controlled trials also showed that adopting regular exercise routines boosted mental health, especially for individuals with existing mental health disorders. However, these studies were typically based on small, short-term and homogenous samples, so the results likely aren’t generalizable to larger, more diverse groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The average effects on mental health are small across all the randomized controlled studies of exercise, and that’s partly because most of the studies focused on people who were not depressed or anxious — you do get bigger effects in those studies,” added O’Connor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re communicating to scientists that larger- and longer-term controlled studies are needed to make a compelling case whether exercise does, or does not, truly impact mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why context matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the evidence is thinnest — but potentially most important — is in understanding contextual factors. The same physical activity can feel very different depending on who the activity was done with, as well as where, when and how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Context can range from peer dynamics and instructor style to external conditions like weather or time of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re outside and it’s hot, and you’re having to walk to work, that’s part of the context,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Or if you go and take a group exercise class — some instructors you really like, and some you don’t. So, that’s also part of the context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we’re trying to help people’s mental health with exercise, then not only do we need to think about the dose and the mode, we also need to ask: What is the context?” O’Connor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For O’Connor, the takeaway is clear. It’s not just movement that matters. It’s the meaning, the setting and the experience surrounding the activity that determines the impact of exercise on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors of the study include Eduardo Bustamante of the University of Illinois Chicago; Angelique Brellenthin of Iowa State University; and David Brown, who recently retired from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2b4844474e5844584e494e4e6b5e4c4a054e4f5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cole Sosebee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uga.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Cole Sosebee – University of Georgia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0000000000003636" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Up for Debate: Does Regular Physical Activity Really Improve Mental Health?&lt;/a&gt;” by Patrick O’Connor et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up for Debate: Does Regular Physical Activity Really Improve Mental Health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is frequently touted as beneficial for mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, based on a 2023 ACSM colloquium, highlights key strengths and limitations of the evidence regarding physical activity and mental health from three perspectives: epidemiological studies, randomized controlled trial experiments, and investigations that explicitly consider the potential role that contextual factors, such as the social climate in which physical activity is completed, can play in physical activity–mental health interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large body of epidemiological evidence supports that regular leisure time physical activity is associated with less depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher amounts of physical activity are often associated with fewer depressive symptoms, but there may be a dose–response point where for some people more is not better but can plateau or even worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological evidence is emerging but currently inadequate to support associations between mental health and occupational, transportation/active commuting, or domestic/household physical activity types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large body of randomized controlled trials, typically small, short duration and conducted with samples biased toward middle-to-higher socioeconomic status Whites, supports that the adoption of regular exercise improves aspects of mental health; however, the mechanisms are unclear and for those without mental disorders the mean effects are small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health benefits of exercise may be partially a placebo response or result from contextual factors surrounding exercise programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small body of evidence supports that contextual elements, such as the program implementation quality and social environment, can influence the mental health outcomes associated with physical activity programs, but the evidence is currently inadequate to identify which contextual variables have consistent moderate or larger effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greater progress will be made in this area when research designs are expanded to include consideration of the potential influence of contextual factors on relationships between physical activity and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 20:50:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE41cEpIVV9BNHNnbmpTM3Jxb3hFMFdxNDYyTWdMUDhPVTRxMzQyMlI2WDNoRWE2Wmo5aW5YMnJFWVJCdC0zYy1sbTh6UUc2NkR6ZFI2MGJvQk9kaVkwbFBHRDVKNmxiS1Z2alZrN1dPSzBIVThN</guid></item><item><title>我以为这只是一个痘痘。实际的诊断让我大吃一惊。-女性健康 | I Thought It Was Just A Zit.

For months, I thought nothing of it. But then the spot started turning red last December. “Maybe it’s just a pimple,” I thought to myself. A week went by. Then another. And another. The &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a19953557/bumps-you-should-never-pop/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a19953557/bumps-you-should-never-pop/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="annoying bump" data-node-id="0.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;annoying bump&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t changing in size, color, or tenderness like a normal zit would—and I was starting to get a little worried. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This peculiar blemish was painless, but it wasn’t showing any signs of fading and I didn’t like how it looked. So, I figured I’d bring it up to my dermatologist, &lt;a href="https://www.drkhorasani.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.drkhorasani.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hooman Khorasani" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Hooman Khorasani&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a dermatologic and cosmetic surgeon in private practice in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;When Dr. Khorasani examined the spot under a microscope, he thought it looked a little suspicious because he could see blood vessels that aren’t normally visible in certain &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a60360644/acne-types/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a60360644/acne-types/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="types of acne" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;types of acne&lt;/a&gt;. He didn’t immediately assume it was something serious like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a60687451/the-current-state-of-skin-cancer/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a60687451/the-current-state-of-skin-cancer/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skin cancer" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.3.0"&gt;skin cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because I was only 31 years old at the time, and incidences of skin cancer rise sharply in those who are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6969010/#:~:text=of%20the%20authors.-,Risk%20Factors,12%2C%2016%E2%80%9321%5D." target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6969010/#:~:text=of%20the%20authors.-,Risk%20Factors,12%2C%2016%E2%80%9321%5D." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="75 or older" data-node-id="2.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.5.0"&gt;75 or older&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But to be on the safe side, Dr. Khorasani collected a small piece of skin tissue and sent it to a lab to be analyzed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;All I had to do was wait for him to contact me with the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-the-phone-rang-my-heart-sank" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="5.0"&gt;When the phone rang, my heart sank.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt; I was sitting at my desk in my Manhattan office building finishing up a day of work as a marketing professional in the beauty industry when Dr. Khorasani called and told me that the mysterious spot on my forehead was actually &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19949282/basal-cell-carcinoma/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19949282/basal-cell-carcinoma/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="basal cell carcinoma" data-node-id="6.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="6.1.0"&gt;basal cell carcinoma&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer/about/what-is-basal-and-squamous-cell.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer/about/what-is-basal-and-squamous-cell.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the most common form of skin cancer" data-node-id="6.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="6.3.0"&gt;the most common form of skin cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He explained that this type of cancer results from mutations in skin cells called keratinocytes. These mutations can be sporadic and happen randomly, but they’re often caused by exposure to UV radiation from the sun, or artificial radiation from &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61898762/gen-z-tanning-bed-trend-risks/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61898762/gen-z-tanning-bed-trend-risks/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="tanning beds" data-node-id="6.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="6.5.0"&gt;tanning beds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hearing that I had “the Big C” was scary, but I felt like I was in good hands with Dr. Khorasani. He reassured me that we caught the lesion early and that the prognosis of basal cell carcinoma is excellent. We made an appointment to surgically remove the spot a couple weeks after I was diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Of course, there is never a &lt;em data-node-id="9.1"&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; time to get cancer. But my diagnosis came during a particularly hectic time in my personal and professional lives. For one, I had just married my husband, Sam, in September, and we were really looking forward to a mini honeymoon in Tulum, Mexico, in early February. Knowing I'd still be healing with my forehead covered with bandages, we decided to postpone the trip by several weeks. Around the same time, I was also given a thrilling opportunity to represent my company at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. But like my upcoming vacation, I had to back out and stay home in Brooklyn to recover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-was-scared-to-have-a-scar-on-my-forehead-forever" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;I was scared to have a scar on my forehead forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The scheduling conflicts weren't the only thing that made my diagnosis frustrating. Even in the hands of one of the world’s top dermatologic and cosmetic surgeons, I still dreaded the permanent scar I would have on my forehead. After all, it’s not a spot that’s particularly easy to conceal from others. But come January 28th, Dr. Khorasani performed what’s called a Mohs micrographic surgery on my face. The procedure is done in stages, meaning Dr. Khorasani removed the cancerous skin cells bit by bit to ensure he spared the surrounding healthy tissue and minimized the size of the scar left behind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="12" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="large" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-large embed css-1mseg9i e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="writer emily haley the day she underwent mohs microgrpahic surgery to remove basal cell carcinoma from her forehead." title="writer emily haley the day she underwent mohs microgrpahic surgery to remove basal cell carcinoma from her forehead." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emily-surgery-day-jan-2025-68643657cf6fe.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0570xh&amp;amp;resize=768:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emily-surgery-day-jan-2025-68643657cf6fe.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0570xh&amp;amp;resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emily-surgery-day-jan-2025-68643657cf6fe.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0570xh&amp;amp;resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emily-surgery-day-jan-2025-68643657cf6fe.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0570xh&amp;amp;resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-fw50lw e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Emily Haley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p data-element="caption" class="css-vaz8ot e1fodxfw1"&gt;Emily Haley the day she had surgery to remove basal cell carcinoma from her forehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The procedure took about five hours and, all things considered, it was pretty easy and painless for me. What came after that took a larger toll: I was forced to wear white gauze on my forehead in the weeks following my surgery, and it was really awkward to explain why I looked the way I did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The state of my scar and the various bandages covering it naturally drew attention, but not necessarily the kind I wanted. I didn’t always feel like explaining myself or revealing that I had been dealing with cancer. However, I’m comforted by the fact that this phase in my life won’t last forever. And that’s because in the weeks and months following my procedure, Dr. Khorasani has—and continues—to perform several procedures to help improve the appearance of my scar. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="15" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="15.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0.0"&gt;Dermabrasion and CO₂ laser resurfacing&lt;/strong&gt;: Dermabrasion gently polishes the outermost surface of the scar to help smooth out any uneven texture. And CO₂ laser resurfacing uses a beam of light to precisely remove tiny columns of skin. When that skin heals, more collagen is produced which helps the scar tissue more closely resemble normal skin.&lt;br data-node-id="15.0.2"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="15.1"&gt;&lt;strong

So growing up, my parents drilled into me the importance of wearing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64760024/facts-about-sunscreen/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64760024/facts-about-sunscreen/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="sunscreen" data-node-id="19.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;sunscreen&lt;/a&gt;, not just while lounging on the beach in the summer, but every day, all year round. And despite spending most of my childhood indoors, at a dance studio in my hometown in Wisconsin, applying the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a46277622/how-much-sunscreen-to-use-on-your-face/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a46277622/how-much-sunscreen-to-use-on-your-face/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="right amount of sunscreen" data-node-id="19.7" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;right amount of sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; multiple times a day was second nature to my family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Nevertheless, my mom developed basal cell carcinoma on her chest when she was in her 60s, which was about seven or eight years ago. And when I was a child, my dad developed precancerous skin growths when he was in his 50s. My family history combined with my alabaster skin made it feel almost unavoidable that I’d face a similar fate. But in an attempt to protect myself, I stuck to my sunscreen routine, never used &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61898762/gen-z-tanning-bed-trend-risks/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61898762/gen-z-tanning-bed-trend-risks/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="tanning beds" data-node-id="20.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;tanning beds&lt;/a&gt;, and visited a dermatologist annually for skin cancer screenings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Developing basal cell carcinoma despite my good habits (and getting diagnosed decades earlier in life than my parents) came as a shock. It was a stark reminder that skin cancer can happen to &lt;em data-node-id="21.1"&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;em data-node-id="21.3"&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="ive-become-a-hat-girly" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;I’ve become a hat girly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Since my diagnosis, I’ve become even more diligent about protecting my skin. Like always, I make sure to apply (and re-apply) sunscreen throughout the day, using products with an SPF of at least 35, as my doctor recommends. And my day-to-day plans don't determine whether I protect my skin. It doesn’t matter if I’m going for a long walk under the sun or leaving my home for a quick grocery run on a rainy day. Wearing sunscreen is like brushing my teeth—a non-negotiable part of my daily routine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;However, when I know that I’ll be spending some extra time outdoors, I do like to take extra precautions. During my trip to Tulum, for instance, I wore rash guards while lounging by the pool and beach, and I spent a lot of time hanging out in a cabana rather than exposing myself to direct sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I also now visit my dermatologist for cancer screenings every six months instead of annually, as is recommended by the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer/after-treatment/follow-up.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer/after-treatment/follow-up.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Cancer Society." data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="25.1.0"&gt;American Cancer Society.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And I plan to pay for &lt;a href="https://molesafe.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://molesafe.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skin cancer surveillance services" data-node-id="25.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="25.3.0"&gt;skin cancer surveillance services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; once a year. The clinic I go to uses artificial intelligence to analyze high-quality photos of my whole body to determine whether I’ve developed any cancerous moles. But perhaps the most fun change in my life has been learning how to embrace wearing protective hats. Sun hats, baseball caps, bucket hats, you name it! Hats that offer coverage from the sun are a new staple of my personal style. And I’m enjoying experimenting and incorporating them into my outfits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-15" data-node-id="26" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="writer emily haley enjoying her vacation by relaxing under a cabana and wearing a rash guard to protect herself from getting skin cancer." title="writer emily haley enjoying her vacation by relaxing under a cabana and wearing a rash guard to protect herself from getting skin cancer." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vacation-mexico-february2025-raw-6864338f42bde.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.220xh&amp;amp;resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vacation-mexico-february2025-raw-6864338f42bde.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.220xh&amp;amp;resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vacation-mexico-february2025-raw-6864338f42bde.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.220xh&amp;amp;resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vacation-mexico-february2025-raw-6864338f42bde.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.220xh&amp;amp;resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Emily Haley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p data-element="caption" class="css-vaz8ot e1fodxfw1"&gt;Emily Haley enjoying her vacation in Tulum, Mexico, while protecting her skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;After months of walking around with various hats and scar coverings, I no longer worry what other people think of me or how I look.

              &lt;p&gt;Scientists are developing all sorts of potential new treatments to tackle the most difficult cancer cases—including some that will make you thankful for the existence of herpes and other viruses. Clinical trial data out today shows that a modified version of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) can help keep late-stage skin cancer at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Southern California and others conducted the study, a Phase I/II trial of people with advanced, treatment-resistant melanoma. About a third of patients given the modified virus, in combination with immunotherapy, saw their tumors substantially shrink, while some even experienced a complete regression of their cancer. A larger, definitive trial of the experimental therapy, code-named RP1, is already underway, and the Food and Drug Administration will decide on an approval later this month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists have been intrigued about the promise of cancer-fighting, or oncolytic, viruses for over a century, according to study author Gino In, a medical oncologist at USC’s Keck School of Medicine. But it’s only recently that this potential has started to look within reach.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Most progress has been made just in the last few decades, thanks to advances and progression in gene editing technologies, which have allowed researchers to specifically design oncolytic viruses that are more effective and safer,” In told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HSV-1, the primary cause of cold sores, has emerged as a particularly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8235327/"&gt;promising candidate&lt;/a&gt; for cancer treatment. HSV-1 is a relatively large virus, meaning scientists can replace or add new genes without too much trouble. And though it does use our cells to replicate, like any virus, it doesn’t insert its DNA into a cell’s genome directly, eliminating the risk of certain mutations (an important consideration for safety). A typical HSV-1 infection also isn’t life-threatening and can be treated with antiviral medications if needed, further limiting its potential danger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These properties have allowed scientists to create strains of the virus that can selectively target cancer cells. The first herpes-based cancer therapy (T-VEC) was &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2015/t-vec-melanoma"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in 2015 for some cases of metastatic melanoma. But researchers like In are especially excited by the new generation of these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RP1 is the brainchild of biotech company Replimune, and it’s one of &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/herpes-virus-cancer-treatment-rp2-1849574410"&gt;several cancer-fighting viruses&lt;/a&gt; that the company is currently developing. Compared to the typical HSV-1 virus, RP1 has been weakened, meaning it shouldn’t be able to cause severe infections. It’s also been modified to not only target cancer cells, but to also boost the immune system’s natural tumor-killing ability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These changes make RP1 both safer and better at killing cancer cells than natural HSV-1,” In explained. And while RP1 might be a viable treatment on its own, Replimune is also testing whether it can be even more effective when paired with other existing immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This latest study involved 140 patients from the company’s IGNYTE trial of RP1 conducted across several sites, including at USC. The participants had late-stage melanoma that was unresponsive to earlier immunotherapy treatment. They received both RP1 and nivolumab, an immunotherapy drug commonly used for melanoma, every two weeks for up to four months. If patients responded to the initial treatment, they continued taking nivolumab alone for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the study’s end, a third of patients saw their tumors decrease in size by at least 30%, the researchers found, and almost one in every six patients had their tumors disappear entirely. Importantly, this shrinkage was seen in tumors directly injected with RP1 as well as uninjected tumors throughout the body—indicating its immune-boosting potential worked as hoped. The combination therapy also appeared to be safe, with most patients only experiencing minor adverse events like fatigue or other flu-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings were &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/246581"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and were &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO-25-01346"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This study provides an important new approach for patients with immunotherapy-refractory melanoma; this is very important since about half of all melanoma patients&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;do not benefit from immunotherapy,” said In. “So it provides a new type of treatment, one that is both effective and well tolerated.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early trials are primarily intended to vet an experimental treatment’s safety and optimal dosing, not its effectiveness. But given the general outlook of these normally untreatable cases, there’s certainly reason to be optimistic here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, Replimune launched a Phase III trial that will test RP1 &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06264180"&gt;combined&lt;/a&gt; with nivolumab in around 400 people with treatment-resistant melanoma. But even before this study concludes, RP1 could become available to the public. In January, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.cancernetwork.com/view/rp1-nivolumab-earns-priority-review-in-anti-pd-1-failed-advanced-melanoma"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; to consider the combination therapy for &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/accelerated-approval"&gt;accelerated approval&lt;/a&gt;, a process that allows a novel treatment to be tentatively approved with less direct evidence of its effectiveness (further trial data is still required to secure a full approval). The FDA’s decision on RP1 is scheduled for July 22.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In and the USC team will continue to study their data to better understand how RP1 works. But they expect RP1 to become a new option for these resistant melanoma cases, and In notes that RP1 is also being tested for other kinds of cancer. If things keep going right, virus-based therapies like RP1 could soon become the next frontier of cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, scientists tell us that those who suffer from ASD and ADHD also face higher vulnerability to common plastic pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study found that their bodies detoxify &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/sya-bpa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bisphenol A (BPA)&lt;/a&gt; less efficiently than neurotypical peers, increasing the time their tissues are exposed to this chemical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6148-2363" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. T. Peter Stein&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://som.rowan.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rowan‑Virtua School&lt;/a&gt; of Osteopathic Medicine led the study. Researchers measured urine glucuronidation, the liver process that adds a sugar molecule to BPA so it can be excreted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with ASD and ADHD had reduced BPA detoxification efficiency compared to the control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28770280/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BPA glucuronidation&lt;/a&gt; was about 11% lower in the ASD group and 17% lower in those with ADHD, while differences in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5842715/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phthalate DEHP&lt;/a&gt; detoxification followed the same trend but were not statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with ASD and ADHD often have weaker detox systems, leaving them exposed to BPA in the body longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t guarantee illness from BPA but raises concern. Stein noted that this was the “first hard biochemical evidence” linking impaired BPA clearance to &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/americaschildrenenvironment/health-neurodevelopmental-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neurodevelopmental disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-asd-and-adhd"&gt;Understanding ASD and ADHD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/autism/what-is-autism-spectrum-disorder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Individuals with ASD&lt;/a&gt; often face challenges in social communication and exhibit restricted or repetitive behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They might have difficulty interpreting social cues, maintaining eye contact, or adjusting to changes in routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensory sensitivities – such as heightened responses to light, sound, or textures – are also common. ASD presents across a wide spectrum, so the degree and nature of symptoms can vary greatly from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, ADHD primarily involves persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with daily functioning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;People with ADHD&lt;/a&gt; may struggle to focus, stay organized, or complete tasks, often acting without thinking or having trouble sitting still. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ADHD and ASD are separate diagnoses, they can co-occur, and some traits overlap – such as difficulties with executive function and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bpa-exposure-in-children"&gt;BPA exposure in children&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/glucuronidation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Glucuronidation&lt;/a&gt; converts toxins like BPA into water‑soluble compounds that exit via urine. In this study, mass spectrometry tracked both bound and unbound BPA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lower percentage of detoxification indicated less efficient excretion. Stein’s team confirmed the effect held true even when accounting for urine strength using creatinine levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of twelve detox pathways tested, only BPA and DEHP stood out, suggesting a specific vulnerability rather than a broad weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing results with metabolomic profiles, ASD and ADHD children showed unique patterns tied to BPA metabolism that controls did not share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bpa-detox-with-adhd-and-asd"&gt;BPA detox with ADHD and ASD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPA and DEHP act as &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;endocrine disruptors&lt;/a&gt;, interfering with hormone signals. If detoxification is compromised, these chemicals linger longer in the body during critical phases of brain development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though genetic vulnerability may play a role, this adds a measurable biological mechanism to the environmental risk picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterile in lab animals, DEHP affects neurodevelopment via epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.03.641339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of prenatal exposure in 847 Australian children linked DEHP levels to later ASD and ADHD symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-role-of-methylation-in-gene-expression-1070/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Methylation&lt;/a&gt; in key genes and neural cell networks showed mediation effects between 21% and 80%. These epigenetic footprints reinforce the idea that plastics can affect neurodevelopment through non-genetic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evidence-of-environmental-links"&gt;Evidence of environmental links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study builds on a large body of research connecting neurodevelopmental disorders to environmental pollutants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK201995/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Epidemiological studies&lt;/a&gt; have associated prenatal exposure to air pollution, flame retardants, and pesticides with elevated ASD and ADHD risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The common thread in these findings is timing; exposure during pregnancy and early life seems to matter most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory bodies have long debated what constitutes a “safe” exposure level for these chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-packaging-other-substances-come-contact-food-information-consumers/bisphenol-bpa-use-food-contact-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/bisphenol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European Food Safety Authority&lt;/a&gt; have reviewed BPA safety multiple times, but the growing evidence suggests current thresholds may not be low enough for sensitive populations, especially children with neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-all-of-this-mean"&gt;What does all of this mean?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study doesn’t claim BPA or DEHP cause &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/children-with-autism-benefit-from-learning-multiple-languages/"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; or ADHD. But it does show that children with these conditions often metabolize these chemicals less efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because BPA exposure is widespread (found in everything from food can liners to thermal paper) this raises questions about safety thresholds for all kids, not just those with ASD or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/autism-and-adhd-disorders-directly-linked-amount-of-time-kids-spend-on-screens/"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing reliance on BPA and phthalates in daily life (choosing glass or stainless steel containers, fresh food over cans, and avoiding receipts) can help limit exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy swings already reflect this concern: several countries are phasing out DEHP and tightening BPA regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bpa-plastics-and-the-future"&gt;BPA, plastics, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies could investigate whether impaired detoxification is present from birth or develops over time. Longitudinal tracking of exposure, detox pathway function, and neurodevelopment could help answer this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also recommend examining genetic variants in detox enzymes, which might identify individuals most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the epigenetic side, researchers are starting to connect prenatal chemical exposure to long‑term &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-your-dna-information-safe-scientists-warn-of-cyber-threats/"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; changes in specific brain regions, pointing to windows of vulnerability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That knowledge could eventually guide nurse‑led intervention, dietary changes, or policies to protect early brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with ASD and ADHD are at a double vulnerability: genetic and developmental differences and a slower ability to clear everyday pollutants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study doesn’t offer advice on treatment or diagnosis, it certainly does ask parents and policymakers to seriously consider chemical exposure in early childhood and pregnancy as a significant factor in neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 18:23:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOV0VPekpjZVNiQUQ0ZDRhZG04QklnWURqNEVGRXVraTlQTXBhem1yQ0QyOXFOekdZUDNjMlhONkJ6TTZKMG1EeExvUTZScnRrbzN3OVJzTnAyWkdLaW5FZVRpb3NKUlRBczJvX0NkVEYtcDBYUGJCLThVc3dMcWNxZWZnY0IxUVBibzBMVTJHTmRobnJr</guid></item><item><title>舌头灼热、味觉丧失和口干？这可能是这种令人惊讶的状况的征兆-预防 | Burning Tongue, Loss of Taste, and Dry Mouth?

But since the infections happen in different places, oral thrush and vaginal yeast infections have very different symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To get you some relief, we’re breaking down exactly what you need to know about oral yeast infections, including their symptoms, treatment options, and how to prevent them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Candida yeast is a very normal part of our bodies, living within our mouths, throats, intestines, and more. In a healthy person, candida growth is kept in check by all the other bacteria living in our bodies, explains &lt;a href="https://doctors.montefioreeinstein.org/providers/1699850461/barry-s-zingman" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://doctors.montefioreeinstein.org/providers/1699850461/barry-s-zingman" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barry S.

Zingman, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of the AIDS center and clinical director of infectious diseases at Montefiore Health System and professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But when something throws off that careful balance of fungi and bacteria, a dominant species can overgrow—leaving us with a host of uncomfortable symptoms, he says. What causes that imbalance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="9" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.0"&gt;Antibiotics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You know how antibiotics can throw off your gut microbiome and upset your stomach? They can also affect other bacteria throughout your body. “The most common reason [for oral thrush] is &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a34239788/antibiotics-for-uti/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a34239788/antibiotics-for-uti/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="taking antibiotics" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;taking antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Zingman says. “This kills off the good bacteria and allows for yeast to grow because there won’t be that competition for space anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="11" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;Weakened Immune System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Anyone with an impaired immune system is at risk, because it’s harder to keep the yeast under control, Dr. Zingman says. This includes those with &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a62235177/endocrinologists-guide-to-diabetes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a62235177/endocrinologists-guide-to-diabetes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="diabetes" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, cancer, and uncontrolled HIV or AIDS. It also includes those on immune-suppressing medications and those with immune deficiencies due to medical procedures like chemotherapy, organ transplants, or stem cell transplants, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="13" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;Inhaled Steroids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Inhaled steroids are an immune-suppressing drug, and they can leave residue in your mouth, allowing yeast to grow. “If a lot of the steroid is deposited in their mouth instead of in their lungs, that suppresses the immune system of the mucus membrane,” Dr. Zingman explains. Many doctors that prescribe inhaled steroids (often for asthma or lung conditions) will recommend rinsing your mouth after taking the inhaler, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="15" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Poor Dental Hygiene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you aren’t brushing your teeth properly, you could leave extra room for bacteria and fungi to grow. This is particularly true for people with dentures: Cleaning them incorrectly can allow yeast to overgrow and cause an infection, Dr. Zingman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="17" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Breastfeeding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Because babies have weaker immune systems, they’re predisposed to getting candidiasis, explains &lt;a href="https://www.onemedical.com/providers/natasha-bhuyan/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.onemedical.com/providers/natasha-bhuyan/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Natasha Bhuyan, M.D." data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="18.1.0"&gt;Natasha Bhuyan, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, regional medical director at One Medical. Both bottle-fed or breastfed babies can get the infection. “This is likely from the infant’s mouth coming into contact with something that contains candida,” she says. “This can also happen if nipples are cracked or have any growth of candida.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="19" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="19.0"&gt;Oral Thrush Symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Oral yeast infection symptoms range from mild to extremely severe and painful, Dr. Zingman says. But some common signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="21" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0.0"&gt;Difficulty eating: &lt;/strong&gt;Oral thrush causes discomfort, making it harder to eat and swallow. And if the candida infection spreads down your esophagus, it can make it difficult for food to pass properly, Dr. Zingman says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.1.0"&gt;Burning mouth:&lt;/strong&gt; The infection may cause your mouth to burn, especially on, underneath, and around your tongue, Dr. Zingman explains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.2.0"&gt;White or red marks: &lt;/strong&gt;Some people notice white marks in their mouths when they’re brushing their teeth. These spots might also be red, if they’re inflamed, Dr. Zingman says. You can differentiate between these white patches and other white lesions because you can easily scrape them off, adds &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/michael-d-turner" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/michael-d-turner" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michael D.

In many mild cases, a visit to the doctor isn’t even necessary. Instead, you can use a toothbrush to clean the area and remove any of the overgrown fungus, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If the infection is extremely uncomfortable—or if the person is immunocompromised—many doctors will prescribe an anti-fungal medication, Dr. Zingman says. These treatments typically last seven to 14 days, depending upon the patient’s response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Some doctors may also use a tongue depressor to scrape off large areas of overgrown yeast, both to help diagnose and to relieve some of the discomfort, Dr. Zingman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Because the most common cause of candida infections is antibiotics, it’s best to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a27396444/skipping-antibiotic-medicine/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a27396444/skipping-antibiotic-medicine/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="only take antibiotics" data-node-id="28.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;only take antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; when absolutely necessary, Dr. Zingman says. Don’t take more than you need to, and don’t take them when you don’t need them (like when you have a viral infection).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s also imperative to practice good oral hygiene by brushing your teeth and any other tools, like dentures, regularly, Dr. Zingman says. If you’re concerned about using an oral steroid, always rinse it well after use, work on your technique with a doctor, or use an extender on the inhalation pump to help get the medication down your lungs, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If your oral yeast infections are recurring, it’s important to get to the bottom of it and treat the underlying issue, Dr. Bhuyan says. Be sure to see your primary care provider. In very rare cases, you may be prescribed antifungal medication as a preventative measure, Dr. Zingman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And don’t worry too much about catching the infection from someone else—unless you’re also immunocompromised or on antibiotics yourself. “It’s not significantly contagious,” Dr. Zingman says. “The yeast is a normal part of our bodies.

But Herriott was "discharged really quickly," and went home ready for rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b0d0c" class="body-graf"&gt;Herriott, 40, of Chicago, Illinois, was feeling swollen and tired, noting that her legs especially were swollen. But she was told this was all normal, especially after giving birth to a large baby, and went home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fb9d0c" class="body-graf"&gt;"We'd only been home a day or so, and it got to the point where I couldn't lay down," she recalls. "If I laid down, I felt like my heart was racing, and I just couldn't sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a036a7" class="body-graf"&gt;She called her obstetrician's office multiple times and was told by staff, "You're stressed, you're worried about your baby, you're a first-time mom," Herriott says. A Google search confirmed that anxiety or stress could explain her symptoms on paper, but the label still didn't feel right to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd5b8f" class="body-graf"&gt;A close friend, who also happens to be a therapist, reminded Herriott that anxiety isn't normal for her. "I have my own problems, but anxiety is not one of them," Herriott says. "I’ve never had the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/how-to-get-rid-of-sunday-scaries-rcna85611" target="_blank"&gt;Sunday scaries&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6ee26" class="body-graf"&gt;She let it go for another day or two, but developed "a really heavy chest and an awful cough," she says. Herriott called her doctor's office again and was told that she probably &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/specials/effects-covid-19-on-pregnancy/" target="_blank"&gt;had COVID&lt;/a&gt;, she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ceb20" class="body-graf"&gt;But her symptoms only got worse. Soon after, Herriott was up at night feeding her baby when she thought she was coughing up phlegm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-91602d" class="body-graf"&gt;"When I turned on the light, I saw I was actually spitting up blood," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc4ae1" class="body-graf"&gt;At that point, Herriott knew she needed to rush to urgent care, where her &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-normal-range-blood-pressure-reading-t174055" target="_blank"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; reading was "200 over something" and the situation felt "really scary," she recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b1411" class="body-graf"&gt;Herriott turned down the offer of an ambulance and drove herself to the hospital. To her surprise, she was "whisked back quickly," and diagnosed with postpartum preeclampsia, a potentially life-threatening &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/parents/moms/postpartum-preeclampsia-mom-details-experience-rcna79764" target="_blank"&gt;pregnancy complication&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-71da37" class="body-heading"&gt;Preeclampsia Can Happen During Pregnancy — Or Right After Giving Birth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-700f3f" class="body-graf"&gt;"Preeclampsia is a blood pressure condition that occurs either at the end of or just after a pregnancy," Dr. Priya Freaney, director of the Northwestern Postpartum Hypertension Program within the Women's Heart Care Program, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd4284" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s a form of hypertension (high blood pressure) that can have severe, even life-threatening, complications for both the pregnant person and their baby if it's not treated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f74e4b" class="body-graf"&gt;The vast majority of cases of preeclampsia happen during pregnancy, says Freaney, who is now Herriott’s cardiologist. And postpartum preeclampsia occurs in fewer than 1% of all pregnancy, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-752dfb" class="body-graf"&gt;During or after pregnancy, preeclampsia can cause symptoms such as severe headaches, shortness of breath, changes in vision, pain in the upper belly and nausea or vomiting, the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-583979"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-c69f5a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-c69f5a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-c69f5a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-c69f5a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-c69f5a.jpg" alt="Herriott (right) experienced postpartum preeclampsia after both of her pregnancies."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Herriott (right) experienced postpartum preeclampsia after both of her pregnancies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Lindsay Herriott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d6ce1c" class="body-graf"&gt;In Herriott's case, another condition — a leaky mitral valve in her heart — caused her to cough up blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-843b2b" class="body-graf"&gt;This condition is "often asymptomatic for many years or decades for people," Freaney explains, "and only comes to light when the system is provoked in a way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-806b2d" class="body-graf"&gt;Herriott's elevated blood pressure, combined with the extra fluid in her body due to pregnancy, caused her mitral valve leak to push fluid backwards into the lungs. That can lead to shortness of breath and coughing up blood, Freaney says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-09e066" class="body-graf"&gt;Because of the preeclampsia, Herriott's medical team took a deeper look at her heart and discovered the mitral valve issue. Both conditions will require some additional monitoring for the rest of Herriott's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-7ce8c2" class="body-heading"&gt;A Second Pregnancy Gave Herriott Another Set of Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46bb2c" class="body-graf"&gt;Knowing that having preeclampsia once put her at risk for the condition again, Herriott's was on the lookout for the symptoms during her second pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed211e" class="body-graf"&gt;After giving birth to son Oakley in October 2024, she was discharged. And, just a few days later, she noticed her heart racing when she tried to lie down — just like before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-68f5c8" class="body-graf"&gt;"I felt like I couldn't really breathe and I was just in a panic," she recalls. "I was like, 'Maybe I'm just having PTSD, but my chest feels so heavy.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b9088f" class="body-graf"&gt;This time, Herriott woke her husband up and contacted her cardiologist's office. A few hours later, she got a call from the nurse, who urged her to rush to the ER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ed5ae" class="body-graf"&gt;Again, Herriott was rushed back for testing. This time, though, she was diagnosed with preeclampsia — and a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs), another life-threatening complication that can occur after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca4f42" class="body-graf"&gt;For Herriott, the experience stirred up a mix of emotions. While she was relieved to have a cardiologist in her corner who could advocate for her in the hospital, learning she also had a pulmonary embolism was terrifying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43cfc7" class="body-graf"&gt;"I immediately started crying because that's what you see in movies where &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-pulmonary-embolism-pregnant-influencer-emily-mitchell-dies-lung-clot-t205923" target="_blank"&gt;people just drop dead&lt;/a&gt;," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0df0a2" class="body-graf"&gt;Herriott was treated promptly in the hospital, and then had to give herself injections of a blood thinner until she was done breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-2f0875"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-01-e5208e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-01-e5208e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-01-e5208e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-01-e5208e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-01-e5208e.jpg" alt="Herriott and her younger son Oakley, who is now 8 months old."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Herriott and her younger son Oakley, who is now 8 months old.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Lindsay Herriott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b00313" class="body-heading"&gt;Preeclampsia Has Lifelong Implications for Heart Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4ae126" class="body-graf"&gt;“A lot of people believe that preeclampsia is a pregnancy problem, and when the pregnancy is over, the preeclampsia is over,” Freaney says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-701f1c" class="body-graf"&gt;But the message experts are trying to deliver now is that “preeclampsia predicts future heart health,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-48e8b7" class="body-graf"&gt;Having preeclampsia is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease later on, including heart attack and stroke, research shows. And those elevated risks can &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/womens-health/high-blood-pressure-pregnancy-heart-disease-risk-rcna28982" target="_blank"&gt;persist for decades&lt;/a&gt; after giving birth, as TODAY.com explained previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-86d455" class="body-graf"&gt;So, while preeclampsia emerges during or directly after pregnancy, it can have a lifelong impact. That's why Freaney encourages people to think of preeclampsia as "an opportunity for heart disease prevention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bbd75f" class="body-graf"&gt;Herriott's newly diagnosed health conditions mean she'll be in contact with her cardiologist for the rest of her life. She monitors &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/at-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-rcna93872" target="_blank"&gt;her own blood pressure regularly&lt;/a&gt;, and she may one day need her &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/news/heart-transplant-helps-3-girls-living-mitral-valve-replacement-rcna193845" target="_blank"&gt;mitral valve replaced&lt;/a&gt;, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e377ef" class="body-graf"&gt;She encourages others to push to find a doctor they trust. Ideally, that doctor is someone who, like Freaney, specializes in the condition you're dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5e1d83" class="body-graf"&gt;More than anything, though, Herriott hopes her story encourages others to take their symptoms seriously, and to trust their instincts when something feels wrong — especially after giving birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb2f86" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Looking back on her second pregnancy, Herriott says, "I was proud of myself for trusting my own gut and (recognizing) that, even in the throes of all the hormones, you do know your body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 17:27:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPc3dwOWxEdkVtNjIyWHgzZE9YNDRTdWRJdk54dlBhNV9hdjZvQlMwYnJqaVBNYzQ4dzZKeTVTRWhLTW5Mb19hZEZPd2pOaVlDeEZlcndHd3RSYkxMTVBlX2JjT25jNHZkMXpGbjZkU1g4TFBzelN2ZEYzelJxQWhibjVrRGpqdllOckM5LU5B0gFUQVVfeXFMUHdGQ1d2QlV4SUNXenhMcmRSTGl3TkY5RGdKQ0F5dVQ1WVhvZkctVUNmdHB6eExITFR2ZXpFR2NqZ0xXMUwyRUphc2p3aWl4OFJEUFlY</guid></item><item><title>专家发现年轻人癌症死亡人数“大幅增加”的原因……以及真正的死亡人数--《每日邮报》 | Experts discover the cause of 'enormous increase' of cancer deaths in young people... and the true toll it takes - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNZE16OUxKdWxhdTZaX2thYnRmVzBUYnZCME10c1pBcjBXVk1Sa1FDQUJrYU1mc1dmanhXOHg0YXZLRXZTQ3BWTDVZaXM4dVV6WEFhS0tyZHJRVzZORWp6U2RJRnZHYzh2bnM3RGQwQWNjYWVCMkJEcWFuU3gxX2FKd1NqZzJCaF9reHJra2VacTRyRDg1YnRlR3V3R3A1YmIxQjNZ0gGoAUFVX3lxTE55TGVEU28xQi1KMlE2UzlEbldYYkZPRzlHZFI2Z3RFZlZPRHpZQUloRTNxZzFTbG1fQVJWZGN2bmpGWDZNaEhYRjlmRlFKakpYaXFuTHdZMnpqYVVNMHEzdXBFRVNPX3ZzMUptdTc2T0ItVWVVbk1hcmEyWjJKdmpremNqLS1pMDRDcnFuMllTTmp4aWpUeE9VQmo5ckQ2THZBZ215d1NLVA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have revealed the reason why an increasing number of young adults are now found to be suffering from late-stage colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-19990fb0-5c17-11f0-88ad-57bc4c87bc6c"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early onset colorectal cancer has become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men under 50 and the second-leading cause for women under 50 in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14799325/addiction-cancer-Crave-book-smoking-alcohol-fast-food.html" class=""&gt;expected to die from colorectal cancer this year&lt;/a&gt;, while 150,000 are predicted to be diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While still a minority, experts remain concerned about increasing cases among younger people as officials estimate 2,600 new cases among those under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies also suggest that cases in people between 20 to 24 have risen by 185 percent while the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-a5657540-5c0f-11f0-88ad-57bc4c87bc6c"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; noted a 333 percent increase in cases among teenagers between 15 to 19 as of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are also expected to double between 2010 and 2030, after having risen two percent a year since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, researchers from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School found that patients with early-onset colorectal cancers often experience delays in diagnosis because neither physicians nor patients initially suspect that they are suffering from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, doctors are more likely to diagnose patients when they are at advanced stages of the disease - leading to aggressive forms of treatment and lower chances of survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to research, reasons such as non-obvious symptoms, lack of routine screening and confusion with other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease can contribute to a delay in diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And not only do young people experience a delay in diagnosis but they also endure hardships unique to their age group such as infertility, medical debt and mental health struggles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are expected to die from colorectal cancer this year, while 150,000 are predicted to be diagnosed with the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Sara K. Char, a clinical fellow in Hematology and Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said: 'The incidence of GI cancers in adults younger than age 50 is rising globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ongoing research efforts investigating the biology of early-onset GI cancers are critical to developing more effective screening, prevention, and treatment strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers conducted a comprehensive literature review of multiple studies focusing on early-onset colorectal, esophagogastric and pancreatic cancers from across the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, they also reviewed previous studies on rare early onset gastrointestinal GI cancers including appendix and neuroendocrine tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists particularly focused on studies that highlighted the risk factors, common patterns, observable traits and underlying genetic reasons that cause colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that one of the most common reasons why young people were not being treated during early stages of colon cancer was due to late diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most colorectal cancers start as colon polyps - tumors in the wall of the colon - that are usually non-cancerous and can be removed during colonoscopies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, sometimes these tumors can turn cancerous if left untreated for prolonged periods of time, according to John Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, colorectal cancers do not show symptoms in the early stages - making regular screening tests such as a coloscopy essential to ensure good colon health. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the CDC recommends that people should begin to get colonoscopies at the age of 45 and repeat every five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency notes that people under the age of 45 suffering from Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or have a family history of colon cancer should also get tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the CDC has no such recommendations for young people experiencing symptoms that may not have a family history of colon cancer or are suffering from related diseases - leading to delayed diagnosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And common symptoms such as abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation), rectal bleeding and weight loss can also be misdiagnosed as IBS or Crohn's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lead author Sara K. Char, a clinical fellow in Hematology and Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A lack of clear early symptoms combined with irregular screening can lead to delays in colon cancer diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with this, the researchers involved in this study also revealed the toll a cancer diagnosis can take on a young adult - which can further fuel delays in diagnosis or treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists noted that despite being in their peak earning years, young patients are more likely to experience financial hardship because of their cancer diagnosis due to treatment costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a 2024 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fightcancer.org/policy-resources/survivor-views-majority-cancer-patients-survivors-have-or-expect-have-medical-debt"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network found that nearly half of cancer patients and survivors had medical debt of over $5,000 despite most of them being insured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that those with cancer-related medical debt are three times more likely to be behind on recommended cancer screenings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, 27 percent of those surveyed with cancer-related medical debt have gone without adequate food and 25 percent have skipped or delayed care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 50 percent of people saw their credit scores decrease and 30 percent had difficulty qualifying for loans - making their financial condition even worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Aggressive forms of treatment can also damage a patient's chances of having a children as excessive radiation can damage and kill reproductive cells and tissues in the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though official guidelines for early-onset and average-onset cancers are the same, researchers emphasized that younger patients are more likely to receive aggressive colon cancer treatment, often without a survival advantage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These aggressive forms of treatment can also damage a patient's chances of having a children as excessive radiation can damage and kill reproductive cells and tissues in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends that oncologists discuss treatment-related fertility concerns with patients of reproductive age, a recent study found that 50 percent of patients reported that their doctors did not talk to them about the impact of their disease or treatment on having future children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can make it difficult for couples' or individuals to conceive over time and impact their quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also found that early-onset colorectal cancer survivors are also more likely to report problems with anxiety, body image and sexual dysfunction compared to advanced onset survivors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also more likely to report worse social functioning and physical quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, male patients with early onset colorectal cancers are more likely to suffer depression than those diagnosed with average onset colorectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, the involved researchers concluded that 'a better understanding of underlying etiologies, optimized screening strategies and improved survivorship support is necessary' for young adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published today in BJS journal by Oxford University Press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE Agriculture, Land and Fisheries Ministry has launched a surveillance initiative after a possible case of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) at a pig farm in North Trinidad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry said in a July 8 press release that PRRS, also known as blue ear disease, is a serious condition affecting domestic pigs, characterised by reproductive failure (abortion, stillbirths, infertility), respiratory symptoms (pneumonia, coughing, sneezing), and increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that PRRS is not a zoonotic disease and poses no threat to food safety and human health. Local pork remains safe for human consumption, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, the ministry is working with the suspected premises and the situation is given the highest priority regarding disease containment and investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nationwide surveillance program on pig farms has been implemented by the ministry's veterinary team to determine if/how far the disease has spread. The ministry is still awaiting country-wide results, which will determine the next course of action for this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release said the ministry's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory was well-equipped to carry out the required testing locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pig farmers should use this time to enhance the biosecurity practices on their premises. These measures include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring only healthy pigs with proper records are allowed to enter farms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quarantine of new stock for at least three weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Placing wheel baths at the entrance of premises and foot baths containing a bleach solution (1 part bleach to 9 parts water) or any other broad spectrum virucidal disinfectant at the recommended dilution/concentration) at the entrance of each pen/section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sanitising all vehicles and personnel prior to entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not allow non-essential visitors on the premises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep records of all personnel and visitors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep premises as clean as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure pest control measures are in place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid sharing equipment between farms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that pork meat remains safe for human consumption, as PRRS has not been shown to cause illness in humans. However, pigs should not be fed pork meat, as they can become infected with the disease via this practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If pigs are displaying signs of illness and/or mortality, do not sell or purchase these animals, and contact your county veterinary officer as soon as possible during the hours 8 am-  4 pm Monday - Friday and they will advise accordingly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;
