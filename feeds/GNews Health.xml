So what do we know about the effectiveness of masks? And how should they be used?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/flu-hospitalisations-record-level-nhs-wes-streeting-0xrbkmcd5" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Superflu ‘tidal wave’ pushes hospitalisations to record level&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;What is the guidance?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The UK Health Security Agency says people with flu-like symptoms should stay at home. If they really need to go out, they are asked to wear a mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It also advises people to get vaccinated if they are eligible, to open a window for fresh air if they are meeting&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; indoors (and it’s not too cold), and to practise good hygiene. That means coughing into a bent elbow, or using a tissue that is quickly disposed of in the nearest bin. People are advised to wash their hands frequently with warm water and soap, and to clean their “surroundings often, especially areas that are touched frequently such as door handles”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Several hospital trusts have reinstated masks for staff, patients and visitors in clinical areas. Some &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/nhs" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; leaders have used stronger language, saying individuals with symptoms &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/mask-public-cold-flu-nhs-covid-transport-x5gkq7whc" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;“must” wear masks&lt;/a&gt;, but official guidance remains advisory rather than compulsory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="11c10735-dc29-484f-bc2f-9acb56d496c5" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Do masks protect individuals?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Research suggests masks can offer meaningful protection, but it depends a lot on what kind of mask is worn and how it is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Respirators such as N95 or FFP2 masks provide the strongest defence, filtering out a high proportion of airborne particles when properly fitted. Surgical masks can reduce exposure to droplets and aerosols. However, they are primarily designed for “source control” — that is, preventing the wearer from spreading large droplets. Homemade cloth masks are also likely to be less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="6.7"&gt;&lt;div id="341f0de2-7cd7-48f7-9852-e717fab3d7d6"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;The FFP2 mask&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Reviews of the evidence point to a general trend: proper mask use is associated with lower transmission of respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For instance, one “meta study” — a study of studies — published in the journal Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness in 2023 brought together the results of seven previous pieces of research. It concluded that mask-wearing in community settings — those studied ranged from university residence halls to Hajj pilgrimages and ordinary households — was linked to a 17 per cent decrease in the risk of catching an “influenza-like illness”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Studies suggest protection will be stronger when masks are used consistently and combined with other measures such as proper hand washing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;During the Covid-19 pandemic many people got used to wearing masks in the UK, where they had previously been a rare sight, even during nasty flu outbreaks. A review of studies carried out during the pandemic, overseen by Wanderley Marques Bernardo of the Brazilian Medical Association, suggested that masks helped to prevent Covid infections, but came with the warning that most of those studies were of low quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="cf9ee5a4-7829-45ce-a299-3fa354dedd3a" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Do mandates work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The evidence here is less clear-cut. Making masks compulsory can only work insofar as the public sticks to the rules. Another meta study published last year in the journal Clinical Microbiology Reviews concluded they can help reduce infections. The benefits will vary with mask quality and how they are used, however. That study also pointed out that “masks are not generally harmful to the general population” but noted that some groups, notably deaf people, were disadvantaged when others were masked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For now, ministers show no appetite for broad legal requirements. The emphasis remains on voluntary action and personal responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a0cc69e8-c871-46c9-8e0f-24de1a173bdc" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;What type of mask should you use?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For personal protection, products such as N95 or FFP2 masks are the gold standard. Surgical masks provide less protection but can be more comfortable for longer wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="7fd65d4c-7ce6-41e9-add0-5c6e372e7d5f" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;How to wear a mask properly?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A well-fitted mask is far more effective. Hands should be washed properly before putting a mask on, and the mask must cover both nose and mouth with no gaps at the sides. Avoid touching the front while wearing it. Disposable masks should be discarded after use. Remove masks using the straps rather than the face covering itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 14:20:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQelQ2Mzh6RTRxa0xKMUdNNW1CZUhQX0M3VWYwSVFmZ1hmbG4xSFlVd0xxc1J6QjR3dmFsT3hGOEN6QW5hN251dWtqOWFzUFRVLVQ5WVFGNkI1WU81ME1iUHI3Y0hhU2QtVkRNSVN4clRTNnJFN3gzWThhbzdVNFFmQTFjRnNOem5HNDdaYUFmY2FRQQ</guid></item><item><title>一项研究表明，一个关键因素比饮食或运动更能预测长寿- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/one-critical-factor-predicts-longevity-better-than-diet-or-exercise-study-says</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;What you gain in a day by staying up late might be curtailing how long you live, according to a new study linking insufficient sleep to a lower life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While poor sleep has been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-live-to-100-these-four-habits-might-help-get-you-there"&gt;previously linked&lt;/a&gt; to a host of health issues and shorter lifespans, this latest investigation found that getting enough shut-eye had a stronger connection to living longer than diet and exercise – factors that are known to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-can-add-10-years-to-your-life-simply-by-changing-your-diet-massive-study-finds"&gt;add years&lt;/a&gt; to your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University (OHSU) crunched the numbers on survey data from across the US, covering the years 2019 to 2025. Measures of life expectancy were compared against self-reported evaluations of sleep duration, with less than seven hours per night considered a threshold for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-found-an-alarming-pattern-in-the-brains-of-sleep-deprived-kids"&gt;insufficient sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-gut-could-be-quietly-controlling-your-sleep-research-shows"&gt;Your Gut Could Be Quietly Controlling Your Sleep, Research Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then factored in other variables that can affect life expectancy, including physical inactivity, employment status, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-017-0381-x"&gt;educational level&lt;/a&gt;. The association between insufficient sleep and lower life expectancy still held. Only smoking had a stronger link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't expect [insufficient sleep] to be so strongly correlated to life expectancy," &lt;a href="https://news.ohsu.edu/2025/12/08/insufficient-sleep-associated-with-decreased-life-expectancy"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; OHSU sleep physiologist Andrew McHill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've always thought sleep is important, but this research really drives that point home: people really should strive to get seven to nine hours of sleep if at all possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184827" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184827" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/SleepChart.jpg" alt="Sleep chart" class="wp-image-184827 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/SleepChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/SleepChart-600x310.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184827" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Life expectancy's association with sleep is stronger than with many other factors, including diet and exercise. Although, as this graph shows, physical activity and social connections also influence life expectancy. (McAuliffe et al., &lt;em&gt;Sleep Adv.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a purely observational study, the research can't prove that less sleep knocks months or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-time-of-day-you-eat-in-later-life-could-foreshadow-an-early-death"&gt;years off your life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study like this also can't untangle the complex interactions between sleep, diet, and exercise. The results do suggest the amount of sleep you get each night is a significant indicator of long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adequate sleep is vital for almost every aspect of our well-being: missing a single night of slumber can impact &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-night-of-poor-sleep-can-change-how-your-brain-sees-food"&gt;brain circuitry&lt;/a&gt; and the body's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-just-one-nights-sleep-changes-your-immune-system-study-finds"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-existing-vaccine-could-slow-dementia-and-cut-death-risk-by-30"&gt;An Existing Vaccine Could Slow Dementia And Cut Death Risk by 30%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not unreasonable to suggest that such health issues may contribute to mortality in the long run. In particular, the researchers highlight obesity and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="184824" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; as two conditions linked with poor sleep that could &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-order-you-get-diseases-can-shape-your-life-expectancy"&gt;reduce life expectancy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's intuitive and makes a lot of sense, but it was still striking to see it materialize so strongly in all of these models," &lt;a href="https://news.ohsu.edu/2025/12/08/insufficient-sleep-associated-with-decreased-life-expectancy"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; McHill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Getting a good night's sleep will improve how you feel but also how long you live."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that our sleep routines are, at least to some extent, modifiable within the limits of our caregiving and work commitments. It might be worth quitting that habit of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-what-doomscrolling-is-doing-to-your-brain-and-how-to-fix-the-problem"&gt;doomscrolling in bed&lt;/a&gt;, or squeezing in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-form-of-exercise-improves-sleep-the-most-study-finds"&gt;session of yoga&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-form-of-exercise-can-improve-sleep-long-term-study-finds"&gt;tai chi&lt;/a&gt; now and then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society recommend &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.4758"&gt;banking at least seven hours&lt;/a&gt; of sleep a night, although there is some evidence that you might be able to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weekend-lie-ins-could-save-you-from-an-early-death"&gt;catch up on the weekends&lt;/a&gt; if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This research shows that we need to prioritize sleep at least as much as we do what we eat or how we exercise," &lt;a href="https://news.ohsu.edu/2025/12/08/insufficient-sleep-associated-with-decreased-life-expectancy"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; McHill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleepadvances/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sleepadvances/zpaf090/8373869?login=false"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sleep Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have a medical question you'd like to get a doctor's answer honest answer to?  Dr. Mara Gordon, a family physician in Camden, N.J., answers reader health questions monthly. Write us at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:thrive@npr.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;thrive@npr.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Question: I've heard there's a self test to check for cervical cancer. I hate getting Pap smears. Is this a safe alternative?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I hear you: Pap smears are &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;fun. At best, they're uncomfortable. At worst, they can be deeply upsetting for people who've experienced sexual or medical trauma.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a primary care doctor, I also know how important it is that my patients get checked for early signs of cervical cancer, the most &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.35369" target="_blank"&gt;common gynecological cancer worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. Traditionally, a doctor would do this with a Pap smear, which involves collecting a sample of cells from your cervix.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But a new approach is starting to be available. You can get tested for HPV — or human papilloma virus — which causes cervical cancer. In fact, &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.70041" target="_blank"&gt;new recommendations&lt;/a&gt; out this month from the American Cancer Society say that patients can safely swab their own vaginas to collect samples for the test, rather than undergo an invasive pelvic exam.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;blockquote class="edTag"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Submit your health and medical questions at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:thrive@npr.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;thrive@npr.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and we’ll consider them for the next Real Talk With A Doc column.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the new approach isn't widely available yet. Here's what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How HPV testing works to detect cancer risk&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HPV is like the common cold of sex. If you've ever had sex, you've almost certainly been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I say, 'You know, it's &lt;em&gt;human &lt;/em&gt;papillomavirus, so everybody who's a human is going to get it at one point or another,'" said &lt;a href="https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/doctor/Rebecca-Perkins" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Rebecca Perkins,&lt;/a&gt; an OB/GYN at Tufts University. "We just need to worry about it if it doesn't go away."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Just like most people fight off unpleasant winter colds, the immune system is also great at fighting off HPV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But if your body can't, your risk of cervical cancer increases. That's why testing for high-cancer-risk strains of HPV is a good way to identify people who could go on to develop cancer. (It's also why doctors' groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/immunizations/human-papillomavirus-vaccines/" target="_blank"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; all kids get vaccinated for it between the ages of 9 and 12.)&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If you do test positive for high-risk HPV, you'll need follow up testing — either with a repeat HPV test or a procedure called a colposcopy, which allows a clinician to examine the cervix under a microscope and take biopsies if needed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;HPV testing is more effective&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HPV testing detects 90% to 95% of pre-cancerous abnormalities, according to Perkins. She is the lead author of new guidelines from the American Cancer Society that help doctors decide how and when to test their patients for cervical cancer. Pap smears, Perkins added, only detect about 70% to 80% of pre-cancers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Let's break down the difference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a Pap smear, a patient undergoes a genital exam with a doctor or nurse. The clinician puts a speculum inside the patient's vagina so she can see the patient's cervix — the bottom of the uterus — and twirls a plastic brush around to collect cervical cells. Those cells are then transported to a lab, where they're evaluated under a microscope to look for abnormalities that can be an early sign of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An HPV test can be done by a doctor or a patient herself. If a doctor does it, it's similar to a Pap smear and involves a speculum exam. That's called a "clinician-collected" test. But a vaginal self-swab is exactly what it sounds like. The patient puts a swab into her own vagina to collect a sample that then is sent to a lab.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many people prefer to swab themselves. It can feel less invasive than an exam done by a doctor, and there's no speculum, which can be uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society's new guidelines include vaginal self-swab as a safe and accurate form of cervical cancer screening. They say anyone who has a cervix should get HPV testing between the ages of 25 and 65. If a doctor does the swab, it should happen every five years. If a patient does it herself, it's every three.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Self-swabbing is not yet widely available &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In May of 2025, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/10/nx-s1-5394446/fda-cervical-cancer-screening-at-home-tool-pap-smear" target="_blank"&gt;at-home kit for HPV testing&lt;/a&gt;. It's proprietary and can only be used through a telehealth company called Teal Health, which charges $99 in addition to billing a patient's insurance plan. Your primary care doctor can't order it for you.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That means that most patients still have to go into brick-and-mortar clinics for cervical cancer screening, even if the patients are doing the swabbing themselves. There, they could undergo either a clinician-collected test or swab themselves in a clinic restroom. At this point, not all doctors offer the self-swab option, but ask yours if they do.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I asked Perkins why I couldn't just order a vaginal self-swab test for my patients and tell them to do it at home rather than making them come in.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The answer comes down to transportation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Imagine you have someone in rural Texas in July [who] does their self-swab, sticks it in the mailbox. The mailbox now hits 200 degrees," says Perkins. "Then it's in the mail truck, then it gets to the lab. It has to still be valid."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As of now, Teal Health is the only company that offers a test proven to be accurate under such a wide range of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A self-swab done in a doctor's office restroom, on the other hand, involves different equipment that will be transported to a lab right away and be kept at a stable temperature.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if it still means a trip to the clinic, many people prefer this to a speculum exam. It can be less painful and it can give the patient a sense of control.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Insurance often doesn't cover it&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many doctors still do Paps instead of HPV-only testing — including me! That's because HPV-only testing requires specific equipment — and even though it's better, it isn't covered by most health insurance plans.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If it's better, why won't insurers pay for it? It's mostly because &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/cervical-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;HPV-only testing is not yet recommended&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government body that issues guidelines about primary care. Perkins says that the USPSTF tends to follow the American Cancer Society recommendations eventually — it just lags by a few years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that their recommendations about cervical cancer screening are currently being updated. Many experts, including Perkins, expect the new guidelines will include HPV-only testing, although it's unclear when they will be issued.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many insurers only pay for what the UPSTF recommends, says Perkins.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Keep up your screenings in your 50s and 60s &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Older women typically don't see gynecologists as frequently as patients in their peak reproductive years. These patients may miss recommended screenings, so if doctors do find cervical cancer, it tends to be more advanced.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Older women tend to have &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/244028" target="_blank"&gt;much higher mortality from cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt; compared to those who are younger.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Perkins is optimistic that self-swab options will eventually make cervical cancer screening more accessible for this age group.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Perkins says the older screening guidelines are also partially to blame for older women missing screenings — they're unnecessarily complicated. In those guidelines, frequency of testing follows an algorithm based on &lt;em&gt;past &lt;/em&gt;test results, which can be hard to track down if a patient switches doctors or goes several years without care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Perkins hopes that a move to simplified HPV-only testing will make it easier for older patients to get screened, with clinician-collected testing at age 60 and again at age 65 regardless of past results.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Gordon works at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University. She writes the Substack newsletter "&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://maragordonmd.substack.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Doctor Friend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As he’s got older, his focus has shifted to ‘functional, dynamic movement, floor-based exercises that mainly use my own body weight.

I don't really care," Evie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She's been playing competitive tennis for the last four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Evie's immune system works beautifully. The hope is that the gene therapy will get FDA approval so that many more children can live long and healthy lives just like Evie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We have a waiting list right now of 20 patients or so who are waiting to get this therapy that is not available because we don't have the funding to make the cell products and treat the patients," Dr. Kohn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Science gave it to her.

It often shows up quietly, behaving like “nothing serious,” and that’s exactly why so many people discover it late. The biggest problem? Myths. Assumptions and half-truths that make people brush off symptoms, skip screenings, or convince themselves everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want people to catch colon cancer early, when it’s most treatable, we have to bust these myths once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Hidden Signs of Colon Cancer You Could Be Ignoring That Might Save Your Life | Dr Deep Goel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 1: “Colon cancer only affects older people.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most stubborn myths out there. A lot of people still think colon cancer is something that happens in old age, and because of that, warning signs in younger adults get waved off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the reality looks very different now. Cases in people under 50 are rising every year, and it’s no longer shocking to see diagnoses in someone in their 20s, 30s, or 40s. It’s not “an old person’s disease” anymore, and ignoring symptoms because of age is a huge reason diagnoses get delayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 2: “Rectal bleeding? Must be hemorrhoids.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one gets repeated so often it feels almost a fact. Yes, hemorrhoids are common, but that doesn’t mean bleeding should be dismissed without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer and hemorrhoids can look very similar in the early stages, and many patients later find out their “hemorrhoids” were actually something much more serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When bleeding is blamed on harmless causes again and again, people end up putting off colonoscopies, and by the time they get one, the disease is further along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 3: “If I feel fine and there’s no pain, there’s no cancer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This myth is exactly why colon cancer often goes unnoticed for years. A lot of people think cancer has to be dramatic, intense pain, major symptoms, something that feels obviously wrong. But colon cancer doesn’t start that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early stages, it can be completely silent or cause tiny changes in your bowel habits, energy, or digestion that are easy to brush off. Waiting for something “big” to happen before paying attention gives cancer the time it needs to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling fine doesn’t automatically mean everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 4: “My stool test was normal” or “I had a clear colonoscopy years ago, so I’m safe.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A negative test is good news, but it’s not a lifelong guarantee. Polyps can develop over time, and stool tests don’t catch everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What usually happens is people get comfortable after a normal report and start ignoring new symptoms like bleeding, anemia, or sudden bowel changes. But new symptoms always deserve fresh attention, no matter how perfect your past reports were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body doesn’t run on a once-in-a-lifetime warranty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 5: “I live healthy and have no family history, so my risk is low.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy lifestyle definitely helps, but it doesn’t make anyone bulletproof. And while family history increases risk, many people diagnosed with colon cancer have no relatives with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This myth creates a false sense of security, “I eat clean, I exercise, so nothing can happen.” But colon cancer can still develop even in people who do everything “right.” That’s why everyone, not just high-risk individuals, needs routine screening when they hit the recommended age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health is helpful, not magical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 6: “Colonoscopy is scary, painful, risky, or too embarrassing.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the myth that keeps people from getting screened altogether. Most of the fear comes from old stories or exaggerated assumptions. In reality, colonoscopies are safe, usually painless (thanks to sedation), and incredibly effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this test special is that it doesn’t just find cancer, it actually helps prevent it. If doctors spot polyps, they can remove them right then and there, stopping them from turning into something dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer is highly preventable and very treatable when caught early. But myths, even the harmless-sounding ones, make people wait, assume, and ignore their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about symptoms without fear, asking questions, and showing up for screenings can literally save lives. Don’t let an old myth get in the way of getting the care you deserve. Your health is worth the check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 05:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>医生揭示饮用水是否真的能降低胆固醇- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/doctors-reveal-whether-drinking-water-210200191.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;The Truth About Drinking Water and Cholesterol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Goodboy Picture Company - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a65445046/common-foods-to-lower-cholesterol/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;—whether they are in range or dangerously high—are a key indicator of your &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a69277325/top-heart-disease-risk-factors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of developing heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;risk of developing heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.

Likewise, many medications can raise your cholesterol levels, including those that treat acne, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a69190458/high-blood-pressure-causes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and others. None of these causes are directly affected by how much water you drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hydration likely supports cholesterol management, but it isn’t a cure,” says &lt;a href="http://www.healthbysapna.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sapna Peruvemba, M.S., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sapna Peruvemba, M.S., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and Ph.D. student in Nutritional Science at Loma Linda University. “Evidence suggests that inadequate water intake may increase cardiometabolic risk, and multiple studies show that drinking water can modestly lower blood lipids. But hydration should be viewed as a complementary strategy alongside established therapies like healthy diet, medications, and exercise, not a standalone treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does hydration impact heart health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While drinking water does not have a direct effect on your cholesterol levels, it does play a role in your overall heart health. “&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a65870951/signs-of-dehydration/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dehydration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dehydration&lt;/a&gt; makes it harder for your heart to pump blood throughout your body,” explains &lt;a href="https://ladybugnutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jamie Baham, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jamie Baham, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cancer prevention registered dietitian at Ladybug Nutrition. One study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/43/35/3335/6553797" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:European Heart Journal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;also found that maintaining optimal hydration, especially as you get older, may help slow declines in cardiac function and reduce your risk of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying well hydrated may also support your efforts to make the healthy decisions that work to lower cholesterol. “One way that water helps our bodies maintain healthy cholesterol levels is in aiding removal of waste and bile,” explains Baham. “When we consume foods that are higher in fiber, which lowers cholesterol, water is key in having a healthy bowel movement and removing cholesterol through the stool. Without water, you’ll be trying to pass a hard stool—which is &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a35415960/how-to-make-yourself-poop-fast/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:constipation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the more water you drink, the fewer sugary beverages you’re likely to have. According to a study in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623086340" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Journal of Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, higher consumption of sugary drinks is associated with higher levels of triglycerides and LDL “bad” cholesterol. “Sugary drinks cause spikes in insulin, which signals the body to produce more cholesterol,” explains Peruvemba. She adds that drinking enough water can also help prevent confusing thirst for hunger, potentially reducing your intake of fatty, sugary, or &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a65664887/ultra-processed-foods-weight-loss-gut-health-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt; that can also contribute to high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drinking adequate water is definitely a support to lowering cholesterol, but it cannot be used as a single-handed treatment plan,” Baham says. Water won’t directly lower your cholesterol, but getting enough can make it easier to make decisions in the kitchen that will help get your numbers down, plus support your heart health overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 04:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOclVhWmw3STY4TlMyUlJVaDRtVXRlWVVFRnVOSTJJWEVNMGg5bW8wc180Yl9lSzZXTWptamhWa01SOGJKQlkwbnV3alJqQXFld0V3NGkxTnRnV2hLUENHamN1bkp3b0dDcjBVbXNrWDJPTE1MeDN3YkZEdHhiWThDc2lTOE1qcEFl</guid></item><item><title>新的癌症治疗为早期试验中的“不可治愈”白血病带来希望- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/new-cancer-therapy-offers-hope-for-incurable-leukaemia-in-early-trial</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A small group of patients with an otherwise incurable form of T‑cell leukaemia have seen their  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="185108" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; driven into remission by an innovative form of immune therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment uses &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/t-cells-31681"&gt;T-cells&lt;/a&gt; – a type of white blood cell – from a healthy donor, re-engineered in the lab to recognise and attack leukaemia cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike personalised cancer therapies made from each patient's own cells, these can be prepared in advance as an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00745-4"&gt;"off-the-shelf"&lt;/a&gt; product and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2304744"&gt;given quickly&lt;/a&gt; to people in urgent need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-immune-cell-discovery-wins-2025-nobel-prize-heres-the-science"&gt;Surprising Immune Cell Discovery Wins 2025 Nobel Prize. Here's The Science.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families facing a disease that has returned after every standard treatment, a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj38ymeyg4mo"&gt;ready-made therapy&lt;/a&gt; that can clear leukaemia to undetectable levels is a major step forward. The latest results of the first 11 patients, treated at Great Ormond Street and King's College Hospital, have just been published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2505478"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific trick here is particularly clever. In T‑cell leukaemia, the cancer itself is made of T-cells, so simply adding more T-cells from outside would normally cause friendly fire: the therapeutic cells would attack each other as well as the cancer or be rejected by the patient's immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251208/Genome-edited-immune-cell-therapy-shows-promise-for-treating-aggressive-blood-cancer.asp"&gt;gene‑editing tools&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have switched off or altered key molecules on the donor T-cells so that they can slip past the patient's immune defences and &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/teen-beats-deadly-leukemia-with-life-saving-gene-edited-cell-therapy/"&gt;focus their attack&lt;/a&gt; on the leukaemia cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early studies, some patients with no remaining treatment options achieved deep remissions, where even sensitive tests could no longer detect leukaemia. This then opened the door to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="185108" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; or bone marrow transplant from a donor, which remains the only realistic route to a &lt;a href="https://bloodcancerunited.org/blood-cancer-care/adults/types-blood-cancer-treatment/stem-cell-transplantation/allogeneic"&gt;long‑term cure&lt;/a&gt; for these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;T-cells explained.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nuance lost in the media coverage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the non-expert, it is tempting to see &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj38ymeyg4mo"&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt; about "reversing incurable cancer" and assume this is a magic bullet that will soon replace chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The truth is both more modest and, in some ways, more impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This treatment is not designed to be the first thing given to every person with leukaemia. It is a specialist option for the few whose cancer has resisted or returned after standard treatments. In that setting, where the alternative may be palliative care alone, having an extra step on the ladder – one more line of defence – can be life changing, even if it is not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another point often lost in media coverage is that this therapy is a bridge, not a destination. In the reported cases, the goal was to reduce the cancer burden enough to make a stem cell transplant feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineered T-cells are not expected to provide lifelong control by themselves. Instead, they act as a very powerful but temporary strike against the leukaemia, buying time for the patient to receive a transplant, which can then rebuild a healthy immune and blood‑forming system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That combined strategy – intensive but time‑limited immune therapy, followed by transplant – is what offers a realistic chance of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-025-02685-5"&gt;long‑term survival&lt;/a&gt; for some of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, life after such treatment is rarely straightforward. A stem cell or bone marrow transplant can save a life, but it is also one of the most &lt;a href="https://haematologica.org/article/view/haematol.2024.286063"&gt;demanding procedures&lt;/a&gt; in modern medicine. In the months afterwards, patients are at high risk of serious infections, because their new immune system is still immature and may also be suppressed by drugs used to prevent rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people experience profound fatigue, weight loss, and emotional distress. A significant number spend repeated spells in hospital coping with complications such as &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1609337"&gt;graft‑versus‑host disease&lt;/a&gt;, where the donor immune cells attack the patient's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38066845/"&gt;own tissues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even years later, survivors may live with chronic skin, gut, or liver problems, hormonal changes, fertility issues, or the &lt;a href="https://www.leukaemia.org.au/education/mental-health/"&gt;psychological impact&lt;/a&gt; of prolonged illness and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From that perspective, it is important not to present this new T‑cell treatment as a simple one‑time cure, after which life instantly returns to normal. For some patients in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; "case series" (a report on a small set of patients), the therapy was part of a long, difficult journey that had already included multiple rounds of chemotherapy and hospital admissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding an experimental immune therapy and then a transplant increases both the chances of survival and the complexity of aftercare. After treatment, care isn't just about checking whether the leukaemia has returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients often need lifelong monitoring for late effects, vaccinations to retrain their new immune systems, and support with returning to work, study, and family life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A transformation hard to overstate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, for those people and their families, the gains are immense. To walk out of hospital after being told that nothing more could be done, and then later hear the words "no evidence of leukaemia", is a transformation that is hard to overstate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_185140" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-185140" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/child_with_leukemia_642.jpg" alt="child, parent, and doctor" class="wp-image-185140 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/child_with_leukemia_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/child_with_leukemia_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-185140" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;To hear the words "no evidence of leukaemia" is a transformation that is hard to overstate.(&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEJePuiO8Y/"&gt;FatCamera/Getty Images Signature&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents describe seeing their children go back to school or play sport. Adults talk about being able to plan a holiday or think about the future again. These very human milestones embody the promise of the science far more clearly than any technical description of gene editing or immune receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet they rest on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3312307/"&gt;decades&lt;/a&gt; of painstaking lab work, safety testing, and thoughtful choices by doctors, and on patients and families willing to take part in experimental treatments when the outcome is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a wider significance beyond this particular leukaemia. If donor‑derived, gene‑edited T-cells can be made safe and effective for one rare and aggressive cancer, the same concept might be adapted for other blood cancers or even some solid tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666634025001047"&gt;off‑the‑shelf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10814647/"&gt;cell therapy&lt;/a&gt; that can be stored, shipped, and given in many hospitals could be far more accessible than bespoke therapies that rely on each patient's own cells, which are complex and slow to manufacture. That said, scaling up production, ensuring the cells are available equitably, and managing the costs will be major challenges for health systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, where does that leave the public trying to interpret dramatic headlines? It helps to hold two ideas in mind at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, this is an extraordinary scientific and clinical achievement for a group of patients who had very few options left, offering real hope where previously there was almost none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it is not a universal cure, and it comes at the price of intense treatment and long‑term follow‑up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most honest way to describe it is as an extra lifeline for some people in very specific circumstances – a powerful new tool added to an existing toolbox, not the end of cancer as we know it. That may sound less dramatic than "reversing the incurable", but for the families involved, it can mean everything.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271643/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

The 4-7-8 method is a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/active-meditation-breathwork"&gt;breathwork practice&lt;/a&gt; rooted in the ancient yogic tradition of pranayama (or breath regulation), which helps relax the body and mind and subsequently eases you into sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, a bit of reckoning: “Research has shown us that sleep is not an optional activity,” says David F. Dinges, PhD, in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6281147/" target="_blank"&gt;his study&lt;/a&gt; that lists the physical and mental effects of a bad night's sleep. Truly, it hurts your entire body, impairing cognition and shortening your ability to focus. Oh, it also puts you in a bad mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man behind the 4-7-8 method, Dr. Andrew Weil, the founder and director of the University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, has dubbed it a “natural tranquilizer for the nervous system.” It works by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our rest and digest mode, while switching off the sympathetic nervous system, which triggers our stress response (or fight or flight mode).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only can this kind of deep and rhythmic breathing help you get to sleep quickly, but it also reduces anxiety, can help us manage everything from &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-stop-sugar-cravings" target="_blank"&gt;cravings&lt;/a&gt; to anger, and helps with the normal functioning of processes like digestion in the body. Given so many of us are chronically stressed, it pays to incorporate techniques like this into your day-to-day routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can do the 4-7-8 to help you get to sleep, in the middle of the night when you wake up, or at any point during the day when you want to feel calmer. However and whenever you do it, Dr Weil advises performing the technique regularly and consistently–ideally, twice a day–to see long-lasting and life-changing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how to do it? The ultra-simple breathing exercise goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Breathe in through your nose for a count of four seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Hold your breath for seven seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Exhale for eight seconds, making a “whoosh” sound through pursed lips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Repeat up to four times, twice per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a beauty or wellness trend you're curious about? We want to know!

Photo: Alissa Eckert / CDC / Public Domain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The Center Square) – Arizona continues to see measles cases along the Utah border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 176 total cases for 2025. Of those, 172 are associated with the outbreak on the Arizona-Utah border, specifically in Mohave County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the last two weeks, we have seen an increase of 22 cases,” said Shane Brady, deputy state epidemiologist with the Arizona Department of Health Services. “We are at six hospitalizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty-six percent of cases involve people under age 18. A majority of those people - 97% - are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and your family from measles,” Brady told The Center Square Wednesday. “One dose is about 93% effective, and two doses provides 97% protection, so it is really important to make sure that everyone stays up to date on all their vaccines, including measles, as it is the best way to protect yourself from disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a contagious virus that officials &lt;a href="https://swuhealth.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Update_-measles-in-Southwest-Utah.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; can remain airborne up to two hours after an infected person has exited a room. Symptoms are known to start seven to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navajo County is the only other county in Arizona where measles cases have been &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; this year. Coconino and Apache County do not have any cases, and like Navajo and Mohave County, they are also on the border with Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked why other Arizona counties do not have cases, Brady said that could be due to a number of factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do know that vaccination rates we’re talking about are childhood vaccinations,” said Brady. “For school data in terms of the 2024-2025 school year, 88.7% of kindergarteners were fully vaccinated for measles, and in Mohave County, that’s 78.4%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady added that the statewide average is lower than the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks, leading Brady to state that Arizona is “very fortunate that we have not spread outside of Mohave County” for this outbreak. That, said Brady, is why Arizona is encouraging people to make sure that they are vaccinated to prevent further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people who get vaccinated will have a breakthrough infection,” said Brady. “Typically, breakthrough infections are less severe.

Symptoms include a persistent cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain. Because there is often a long latency period between exposure and symptom onset, diagnoses are frequently delayed, according to DPH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As the disease progresses, it can result in serious complications, including lung cancer, tuberculosis and even death, the department added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Officials added that "most cases of silicosis are work-related – it is very rare for silicosis to occur outside of workplace exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cdc-reports-19th-cruise-ship-norovirus-outbreak-year-affecting-passengers-crew" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cdc Reports 19Th Cruise Ship Norovirus Outbreak This Year Affecting Passengers And Crew;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cdc Reports 19Th Cruise Ship Norovirus Outbreak This Year Affecting Passengers And Crew&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A father and son set up a quartz countertop at a booth in Albany Sept. 15, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Officials said the risk exists when handling natural stones, such as granite, but is especially high when working with engineered stone, such as quartz.

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two birds were taken to a state laboratory for testing, and the health department said preliminary results indicate the birds died from highly pathogenic avian influenza, known as bird flu. Samples have been sent to a national lab for further confirmation, officials said. Those results are expected to take 10 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clermont County Public Health said the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, has been found in wild and domestic bird populations since 2022 throughout the country, including Ohio. Transmission can increase in the spring and fall with bird migration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can get bird flu, but the health department said it's very rare in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As a general precaution, people should observe wildlife from a distance and avoid contact with sick or dead animals. Likewise, bird owners or people who have backyard flocks should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds," Clermont County Public Health said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/piercetownshipohio/posts/pfbid02B9EHhtj2qvKqQD47KEkvnxWB3zK8MwVWEzVW882tMQJUgR7iAbDzZ2EW3P6KWncNl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Facebook post&lt;/a&gt;, Pierce Township, Ohio, said the risk to residents is low, but anyone who finds dead birds near their home is asked to keep their distance and call the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A sperm donor, who is an asymptomatic carrier of a genetic mutation increasing the risk of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="185089" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, was used to conceive nearly 200 children worldwide, Denmark's public broadcaster revealed Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2006 and 2022, the man's sperm was sold to 67 clinics in 14 countries. In Denmark alone, 99 children were fathered by the donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At least 197 children were born thanks to the sperm of an anonymous Danish donor using the alias Kjeld before the sperm bank discovered a serious genetic abnormality," public broadcaster DR &lt;a href="https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/salg-af-saed-med-uopdaget-kraeftrisiko-har-foert-til-mindst-197-donorboern"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-oldest-baby-may-not-be-a-record-for-long-says-expert"&gt;'World's Oldest Baby' May Not Be a Record For Long, Says Expert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to DR, Denmark's European Sperm Bank, one of the largest in the world, was alerted in April 2020 that a child conceived via donation and diagnosed with cancer carried a genetic mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It then tested a sample of the donor's sperm, but the screening did not detect the rare &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/tp53/"&gt;TP53 mutation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_185106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-185106" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/lab_test_sperm_642.jpg" alt="lab testing on a sperm sample" class="wp-image-185106 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/lab_test_sperm_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/lab_test_sperm_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-185106" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Tests were conducted on the donated sperm after reports surfaced of a child conceived with donation being diagnosed with cancer.

He figured it was because he was holding a kitten, according to the report, which does not identify the man or where he resided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He fought off the skunk, rendering it unconscious, and walked away with a scratch on his shin that bled. But he didn’t think he’d been bitten, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, the man started experiencing hallucinations. He also had a stiff neck, confusion and difficulty swallowing and walking. Two days after his symptoms appeared, he was found unresponsive at home. He was resuscitated and taken to a hospital, but he never regained consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five days in a hospital, he was declared brain dead and removed from life support. His left kidney, heart, lungs and both corneas were recovered for donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His kidney went to a man from Michigan, who received the transplant at a hospital in Ohio. Five weeks later, the man started experiencing tremors, confusion, urinary incontinence and weakness in his legs. He was hospitalized with fever, difficulty swallowing and an extreme fear of water. Clinicians suspected he had rabies, and several samples were sent to the CDC for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a week at the hospital, the Michigan man died. Local public health officials interviewed his family, who reported that he had not been exposed at any animals. But the testing showed evidence of rabies in his saliva, skin and brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when the CDC, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and an Idaho public health district began investigating the donor as the source. Health officials tested the Idaho man’s right kidney, which had not been donated, and detected a rabies variant linked to silver-haired bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, three other patients, one each from Idaho, California and New Mexico, received ocular grafts prepared from the Idaho man’s recovered corneas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As officials investigated the donor’s rabies status, the cornea recipients had their grafts removed as a precaution and received post-exposure prophylaxis, a medication taken after potential exposure to rabies to prevent infection. Rabies is almost always fatal without that medication, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;                        &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_1140/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_960/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_768/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 601px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_640/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 441px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_480/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 320px)"&gt;                                                &lt;img class="responsive-image" srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_1140/Rabies%202.JPG" alt="Rabies vaccines." title="Rabies 2.JPG" loading="lazy"&gt;                            &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;                                        &lt;figcaption&gt;                                            Rabies vaccines.

Another corneal graft transplant planned for a Missouri patient was canceled. Later, the CDC detected rabies in one of the previously implanted grafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is excluded from routine donor pathogen testing in the U.S. because of its rarity in humans and the complexity of diagnostic testing, according to &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, hospital staff who treated the Idaho man were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his symptoms to chronic comorbidities. After rabies was suspected in the Michigan man, a biopsy that had previously been collected from the donor on his third day at the hospital was revisited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare did not immediately respond to a request for details about the Idaho man, including where he lived in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="13" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn co-authored the CDC report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;December 10, 2025 at 5:33 PM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="story-module"&gt;&lt;div class="author-card "&gt;

Rabies is almost always fatal without that medication, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;                        &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_1140/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_960/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_768/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 601px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_640/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 441px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_480/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 320px)"&gt;                                                &lt;img class="responsive-image" srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_1140/Rabies%202.JPG" alt="Rabies vaccines." title="Rabies 2.JPG" loading="lazy"&gt;                            &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;                                        &lt;figcaption&gt;                                            Rabies vaccines.

Another corneal graft transplant planned for a Missouri patient was canceled. Later, the CDC detected rabies in one of the previously implanted grafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is excluded from routine donor pathogen testing in the U.S. because of its rarity in humans and the complexity of diagnostic testing, according to &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, hospital staff who treated the Idaho man were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his symptoms to chronic comorbidities. After rabies was suspected in the Michigan man, a biopsy that had previously been collected from the donor on his third day at the hospital was revisited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare did not immediately respond to a request for details about the Idaho man, including where he lived in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="13" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn co-authored the CDC report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;December 10, 2025 at 5:33 PM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="story-module"&gt;&lt;div class="author-card "&gt;

On one of the days we were here, 932 patients came through the door. That number is expected to rise in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Attendance levels are already around 8% higher this year than last year. And the unit faces a daily shortage of between 50 to 70 beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At the Royal Infirmary around 64 beds are currently taken up by people with respiratory viruses, including flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;We meet one patient who waited 106 hours for a bed on a ward.

He expects numbers to climb into January. "That is one of the many things I am concerned about at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"At this point I feel we are working at the limits of our ability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Turning minor cases away&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The hospital has introduced a new system to manage the flow of patients arriving at its emergency department, as pressure grows on front-line services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Receptionists, nurses, all the way up to consultants, now sit in a bank of desks at the entrance, assessing patients as they arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This speeds up triage, moving people away from the front door and ensuring those in greatest need receive urgent care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Staff say the range of cases has become increasingly polarised. Some of the most seriously ill patients are being driven in by relatives because of long waits for ambulances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Flu has started early this year&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At the other end of the scale, people turn up with minor complaints after struggling to secure GP appointments. "Last week someone came in with a coldsore," one nurse tells us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Experienced staff can redirect those who do not need urgent care, helping them to book GP appointments or pointing them towards pharmacies and other services. Now one in 10 patients are sent away, although staff admit it can lead to frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Security has been tightened following one violent incident, with glass screens installed and 24‑hour guards now in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Leicester Royal Infirmary has introduced new measures each year to boost capacity and manage rising demand. Winter pressures continue to grow, while the quieter summer months have become a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To reduce ambulance queues, prefabricated structures were converted into a permanent unit with 14 beds - all are full during the BBC's visit. Without them that would have been 14 ambulances queueing for hours to unload their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Unlike many hospitals, Leicester's emergency unit is not totally overwhelmed by elderly patients.

The experts said the therapy, known informally as TRT, has been underutilized due to outdated concerns about risks of prostate cancer, stroke and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/no-heart-risks-testosterone-replacement-therapy-study-finds-rcna89229" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fa563f" class="body-graf"&gt;“Testosterone is still regulated as if it were a dangerous, performance-enhancing drug from the athletic doping scandals of the 1980s. And because of this outdated classification, many physicians fear prescribing it or even screening for it,” said Dr. Helen Bernie, an associate professor of urology at the Indiana University School of Medicine, who was one of the panelists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-670c9a" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel was part of a series that the FDA rolled out earlier this year. In each, the agency convenes medical experts for roundtable discussions that can give clues about regulatory changes the FDA might pursue. Three months after a similar panel on hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women, for example, the FDA announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/hormone-replacement-therapy-no-warning-label-fda-rcna243008" target="_blank"&gt;removing a black box warning from the medications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-132537" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday, several panelists suggested that the FDA should expand its approval of TRT drugs to include men with low testosterone levels and any related symptoms, in accordance with guidelines from the American Urological Association. So far, the FDA has only approved forms of TRT — including gels, pills, patches and injections — for men who have both low testosterone and an associated medical condition, such as a genetic disorder that prevents the testicles from producing the hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b26ced" class="body-graf"&gt;“Given the label restriction, one can make the argument that thousands of patients in need of testosterone therapy have been and are being deprived of it,” said Dr. John Mulhall, a panelist and urologic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-18b9d1" class="body-graf"&gt;Testosterone therapy has soared in popularity in the last five or so years — in large part among young men who have turned to it for unapproved uses such as increasing muscle mass. The medication is widely promoted on social media for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03d78b" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s not that there is an increase in the prevalence of testosterone deficiency,” said Dr. Bobby Najari, a urologist at NYU Langone Health, who was not part of Wednesday’s discussion. “I think it’s an increase in the demand for a drug that can make it easier to have physiques that we see in superhero movies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6792a1" class="body-graf"&gt;Some wellness clinics and “longevity centers” also offer TRT as a purported way to slow the effects of aging, though the FDA has not approved it for that purpose. The agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-cautions-about-using-testosterone-products-low-testosterone-due" target="_blank"&gt;cautioned in February&lt;/a&gt; that the safety and benefits of this use have not been established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5092e3" class="body-graf"&gt;Now-Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfl6ClEz5oo" target="_blank"&gt;told Newsmax in 2023&lt;/a&gt; that he was taking testosterone replacement at the time as part of an “anti-aging protocol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-310c45" class="body-graf"&gt;Typically, men’s testosterone levels decline about 1% per year starting in their 30s or 40s. Levels aren’t considered low until they reach a certain threshold. After that point, some men experience short-term symptoms such as fatigue, low sex drive and erectile dysfunction, as well as long-term ones like osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a0702" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel included little discussion of the drawbacks of TRT, such as an elevated risk of blood clots. TRT can also shut down sperm production, so doctors don’t recommend it to men trying to have children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-362c3b" class="body-graf"&gt;“If they take it long enough, and they’re rendered infertile, it may not be reversible,” said Dr. Marc Goldstein, surgeon-in-chief of male reproductive medicine and surgery at Weill Cornell Medicine, who wasn’t on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d2058d" class="body-graf"&gt;Not all cases of low testosterone need to be treated with TRT, he added — some can be addressed through weight loss or an outpatient surgery to remove swollen veins in the scrotum called varicoceles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d05ce7" class="body-graf"&gt;Najari, meanwhile, said it’s important to manage expectations about how much TRT can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-99f255" class="body-graf"&gt;“A small group of men don’t feel any change at all,” he said. “On the other end of that curve, a small group of men say, ‘I feel so much better. This really changed my life.’ And then the majority of men say, ‘I feel a little bit better.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc6a61" class="body-graf"&gt;The panelists on Wednesday argued that the Drug Enforcement Administration should remove its designation of testosterone as a Schedule 3 drug — the same category that the drug ketamine is in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db1e49" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Landon Trost, a panelist and the director of the Male Fertility and Peyronie’s Clinic in Orem, Utah, said that because prescriptions for Schedule 3 drugs must be carefully tracked, physicians may be hesitant to give them and some pharmacies may choose not to carry the drugs or limit their volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcdf3b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Because of that, you get these pop-up T clinics and other things that will fill that gap, whereas normally the patient would be going to their primary care physician, their urologist, their endocrinologist,” Trost said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8af8cf" class="body-graf"&gt;The FDA says the broader goal of these panels is to “modernize regulatory oversight,” but some public health experts have &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fda-kennedy-antidepressants-hormones-meetings-experts-afbd525b29ca5e2585b79548a075be75" target="_blank"&gt;criticized them&lt;/a&gt; for not incorporating a diversity of viewpoints or thoroughly screening panelists for conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-92cfde" class="body-graf"&gt;Some experts have also expressed concern that the format may be taking the place of a more formal review process and that panelists are picked to support changes that Kennedy favors. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, said that a panel on antidepressant use during pregnancy was “alarmingly unbalanced.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e89d3" class="body-graf"&gt;FDA Commissioner Marty Makary pushed back against that line of criticism on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dcf37f" class="body-graf"&gt;“The FDA today is making it clear that we want to learn more about this topic. We don’t have preconceived ideas. We are not promoting any medical recommendation or any product,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-42dd38" class="body-graf"&gt;Several panelists noted that doctors’ understanding of testosterone therapy has changed over the last several decades. Although the FDA had previously identified reports of strokes and heart attacks in patients taking the hormone, a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2215025" target="_blank"&gt;large clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; launched in 2018 did not find those risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ebabe3" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;In light of the trial results, the FDA in February recommended &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-issues-class-wide-labeling-changes-testosterone-products" target="_blank"&gt;removing a warning&lt;/a&gt; about an increased risk of cardiovascular issues from testosterone products. However, the agency said the products must add a warning about increased blood pressure based on the results of other safety studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 23:17:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNVU1IQVFtbEFEenU0NHdGZ3ZWbUVERHAtdTJTMldMTDJlbjNtWlFrY1doZ281eVp1REFxVW1sY2dwWnRaTjdYNGFIZDBEZHhRc1NwQjhXc1pybzB6NktJQlluNGdaNTRGX1dJZjJUWFhtMkdIaS1pZUF4LVY0NEw1cElrOHBsYjQ5N1hpNk5TbFZ2SmpvblJWVXVHdGnSAVZBVV95cUxNRXE5NlRLemk0UUNDYlk4RFRUMk82aDluaXZFZGxSYjJ6S2pjaDhjUHhqNXBnQUoxSkhFVUw5alBTSnpGSWIxdU9adkphUkNvMUpxdTJqUQ</guid></item><item><title>儿童成为康涅狄格州四年多来首例麻疹病例： DPH - NBC康涅狄格州</title><link>https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/child-becomes-connecticuts-first-case-of-measles-in-more-than-four-years-dph/3673811/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content rich-text"&gt;
									
					
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut has its first case of measles in more than four years, according to the Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case is in an unvaccinated Fairfield County child under the age of 10, the department said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The child recently travelled internationally and began showing symptoms of measles several days later, they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symptoms included a cough, runny nose, congestion, fever, and then a rash starting at the head and spreading throughout their body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Department of Public Health, measles is highly contagious and can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Measles can be dangerous, especially to children under five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The single best way to protect your children and yourself from measles is to be vaccinated,” said DPH Commissioner Manisha Juthani, MD. “One dose of measles vaccine is about 93% effective, while two doses are about 97% effective. We must ensure we continue to protect those who matter most – children and other&lt;br&gt;vulnerable people – from vaccine preventable illnesses through on-time vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of the disease usually begin 7-14 days after a person is exposed to an infected person. Typical cases of measles begin with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a sore throat. Then, three to five days later, the person will develop a red or reddish-brown rash, usually starting on their face at the hairline and then spreading down to the entire body, according to DPH.&lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;p&gt;There have been more than 1,800 cases of measles reported nationwide in 2025 -- the most since the virus was declared eliminated in 2000, according to the International Vaccine Access Center.&lt;/p&gt;

Here in the US, they’re “not a natural part of our diet like in a lot of other populations,” &lt;a data-offer-url="https://theceliacmd.com/integrative-medicine-doctor/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://theceliacmd.com/integrative-medicine-doctor/"}' href="https://theceliacmd.com/integrative-medicine-doctor/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amy Burkhart, MD, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a physician and registered dietitian who specializes in gut health, tells SELF. Germany has sauerkraut, Korea has kimchi, China has stinky &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/high-protein-tofu-meals" target="_blank"&gt;tofu&lt;/a&gt;, Japan has &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/miso-health-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;miso&lt;/a&gt;, but Americans—ever behind gastronomically—don’t have a signature fermented dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But interest in fermented food is growing steadily as people become more cognizant of its far-reaching &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/how-to-improve-gut-health" target="_blank"&gt;benefits for the gut&lt;/a&gt;. And unlike some contemporary nutrition trends (looking at you, &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/how-protein-got-turned-into-cultural-trend" target="_blank"&gt;protein craze&lt;/a&gt;), it’s not all hype: Eating a diet rich in fermented foods really is a big win for your digestion, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/alma-simmons" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/alma-simmons"}' href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/alma-simmons" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Alma Simmons, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells SELF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we’ll break down how exactly fermented foods translate into a &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/health-conditions/digestive-health" target="_blank"&gt;digestive boost&lt;/a&gt;; which fermented foods are best; whether fermented foods pose any health risks; and what you should keep in mind if you’d like to incorporate them into your diet more often. (Number one: “Don't be wary of trying them!” Dr. Burkhart says.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why are fermented foods so good for gut health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermentation involves the breakdown of &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/what-are-carbohydrates" target="_blank"&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; like sugars and starches by beneficial microorganisms like bacteria, yeasts, and molds, especially lactic acid-producing bacteria. In nutrition-speak, these microorganisms are often termed “&lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/probiotics-vs-prebiotics" target="_blank"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;.” When you ingest these microbes in fermented foods, drinks, or &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/probiotic-supplements-for-gut-health" target="_blank"&gt;probiotic supplements&lt;/a&gt;, they can positively affect your digestive system in a multitude of ways. Not only do they support your gut microbiome—the collection of microorganisms that live in your digestive tract—but they also strengthen the tissue that lines the gut (a.k.a. the “gut barrier”), improve your body’s ability to absorb nutrients, and reduce digestive symptoms like &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/how-to-make-yourself-fart" target="_blank"&gt;gas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/why-am-i-so-bloated" target="_blank"&gt;bloating&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/best-foods-for-diarrhea" target="_blank"&gt;diarrhea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to their GI effects, these microbes can also benefit your health in other ways. They reduce &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/how-to-reduce-inflammation-in-the-body" target="_blank"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, mediate your &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/support-immune-system" target="_blank"&gt;immune response&lt;/a&gt;, balance &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/signs-of-high-blood-sugar" target="_blank"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, and lower harmful LDL &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/cholesterol-types" target="_blank"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and triglyceride levels. Plus, “there is some evidence that they can improve mood and cognition,” Dr. Burkhart says. What’s more, she notes, many of these non-digestive perks may boost digestive health indirectly—a “circular effect.” Inflammation, for example, is widely believed to be a factor in &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/health-conditions/autoimmune-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;autoimmune conditions&lt;/a&gt;, including digestive disorders like &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/ibs-ibd-difference" target="_blank"&gt;IBD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/health-conditions/celiac-disease" target="_blank"&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt;, so by that token &lt;em&gt;decreasing&lt;/em&gt; it could further reduce symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SELF Magazine</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 22:47:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBmUmptQ2Q2OTJid2pxeXUzN0JRX0lEalQzSXhaS01peE9lMUY4SnJjYkZ3SXdKdHdZTlRCd2lnX3hOV0NFWmdjRWFTTTNNLWhna3plSDlJUG5WQkFUcVE3eFp5WDJkYmR3bXJxU2s2Zw</guid></item><item><title>130多名学生在同一天喊话后，马萨诸塞州学校暂时关闭- MassLive.com</title><link>https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/12/mass-school-closes-temporarily-after-more-than-130-students-call-out-on-the-same-day.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UZYXBQCEF5DEJCYGYDR7NUGGYI"&gt;Medford school officials have decided to cancel school at one of the city’s elementary schools on Thursday after over 130 of the school’s students were absent on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XNSHOLOITFGKJLY3VFHN35ZKLY"&gt;Local and state health officials suspect the absences at Roberts Elementary School are due to an outbreak of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/index.html"&gt;Norovirus&lt;/a&gt;, as many of the school’s students and staff have reported having upset stomachs, &lt;a href="https://roberts.mps02155.org/about/roberts-es-news/roberts-es-news-post/~board/roberts-news/post/no-school-121125?fbclid=IwY2xjawOmwu9leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETF4RDR1MnNkU3duRXBWd0JSc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHvQlTVPY4tx3dmKgxF43vW6IpOWv0u_N7kTO4XzTKb2ggQKfpPPbSF6a4MQ3_aem_miyct9jMsJPdaD8hnp0ZnA" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://roberts.mps02155.org/about/roberts-es-news/roberts-es-news-post/~board/roberts-news/post/no-school-121125?fbclid=IwY2xjawOmwu9leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETF4RDR1MnNkU3duRXBWd0JSc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHvQlTVPY4tx3dmKgxF43vW6IpOWv0u_N7kTO4XzTKb2ggQKfpPPbSF6a4MQ3_aem_miyct9jMsJPdaD8hnp0ZnA"&gt;school administrators wrote in a letter to families&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Z4S34EDSJBGDHHDL5VKSHYHWSY"&gt;City and school officials decided to close the school, &lt;a href="https://roberts.mps02155.org/about/welcome" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://roberts.mps02155.org/about/welcome"&gt;which serves approximately 530 students in grades pre-K through 5&lt;/a&gt;, to take action to stop the spread of the highly contagious virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UMGG6EPZ65HRZKF5ZYSA72BDUQ"&gt;“The closure of the Roberts Elementary School tomorrow will allow for a professional company to deep clean the school,” the letter reads. “Out of an abundance of caution, the Medford Board of Health is also examining Roberts cafeteria equipment to rule out any other potential causes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FQRGX6HNQVGYZEVIWDR5G6FA5E"&gt;All other Medford schools will open as normal on Thursday, school officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W5DVMIABDNB4HMNSKDKEJO6LXU"&gt;“If you or your child is experiencing Norovirus symptoms, the Board of Health and MPS Health Services recommend that all students and staff should wait 24 hours after experiencing vomit-like symptoms before returning to school,” the letter reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RD5M3IQL2RH3JOP67L4OSSRECQ"&gt;A make-up day for Roberts Elementary School will be scheduled later in the year, school officials said.

            As multiple measles outbreaks simmer across the United States, cases are accumulating nearly as quickly as when the West Texas outbreak was at its peak this spring.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00043b6nm315297y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were 84 new measles cases reported in the past week nationwide, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html?lsdjfld" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; posted Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s more cases than have been reported in a single week since April, when there was an average of about 100 new cases per week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00053b6npjq9fyyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas hasn’t reported any new measles cases since state officials declared that the outbreak there was over in mid-August.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00063b6nqo8z8idr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, case counts are growing quickly in South Carolina, where &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;state health officials say&lt;/a&gt; more than 250 people are in quarantine after possible exposure and 16 are in isolation because of illness. Some of them are in quarantine for a second time because they did not acquire additional protection — through vaccination or natural immunity from an infection — since the first exposure, state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell said at a briefing Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00073b6ncgfcb0rz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a reminder that the maximum incubation period for measles is 21 days, so for any student or anyone to have to go through that quarantine period twice, that’s a significant amount of time,” Bell said. “Vaccination continues to be the best way to prevent the disruption that measles is causing to people’s education, to employment and other factors in people’s lives in our communities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00083b6nkq6m6ghg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And new cases in the state are adding up at an accelerating pace, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00093b6ni56thchw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although there is overall good compliance with quarantine recommendations, Bell said that some factors contributing to the concerning “spike” are holiday gatherings, travel and “lower than hoped for vaccination coverage” for a highly contagious virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000a3b6nwwugglwg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been 111 measles cases reported in South Carolina since the outbreak started in October, according to data from the state health department, and at least 105 of those were in people﻿ who had never received a dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended in childhood and offer 97% protection against measles infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000b3b6njyqa28b2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the cases are in the upstate region, near Greenville. The state has reported dozens of new cases since Friday, with most coming from an exposure at a church. Exposures have also occurred at schools and medical settings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000c3b6n11vdxuy0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The majority of our cases stem from exposures in known settings. But what we want people to pay attention to is that with each new case in an undervaccinated population, the number of contacts around each new case can spur more and more cases because the disease is so highly infectious,” Bell said. A “similarly rapid increase in vaccination coverage” is important to contain the spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000d3b6n9wtxenlv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles cases also continue to accumulate in Utah and Arizona, where an outbreak along the state line has been growing for months. Arizona has &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 176 cases as of Tuesday — second only to Texa﻿s this year – while Utah has &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 115 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000e3b6nvrhlk13f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s been a record year for measles in the US. Between January and July, there had been close to 1,300 cases reported, more than in any other year since the disease was declared eliminated in the country a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000f3b6n68tmulg8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, the US has recorded more than 1,900 cases for the year, CDC data shows, and the vast majority have been among people who were unvaccinated. If the outbreaks continue into January, the US is at risk of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/28/health/measles-elimination-who-report"&gt;losing its elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/canada-measles-elimination-status-removed"&gt;Canada did last month&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000g3b6n7yi3f0sk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been 47 outbreaks in the US in 2025, nearly three times more than there were last year, according to the CDC. An outbreak is defined as three or more cases that are related.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0hrb9800063b6s8toorxz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 200 people have been hospitalized, and three people — including two children — have died because of measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

At the same time, fewer people are getting their flu shots. It’s not too late to get your shot. Photo: Getty Images.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer people are getting their annual flu shots this year, just as flu infections are rising and the ominous new “K” flu variant is spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Colorado, only about 25% of people have gotten their flu shots so far this fall, &lt;a id="" href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/respiratory-virus-immunization-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to data&lt;/a&gt; from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s down from about 27% of people who had gotten their flu shots by this time last year. And it’s a significant drop from the 32% of Coloradans who got flu shots during the entire winter respiratory virus season in 2024 and 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While misinformation about vaccines has driven down the number of people who are getting all types of vaccines — including those that protect people from the flu — the drop in the percentage of Coloradans who are getting annual flu shots comes at a particularly dangerous time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because a new flu variant has been surging around the world and has caused bad, early flu outbreaks in Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada. This variant, known as the Type A H3N2 “subclade K” is now spreading in Colorado and across the U.S., prompting warnings from infectious disease experts that we could face a tough flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the U.S., 20,000 to 30,000 people still die every year from the flu,” said &lt;a href="https://www.uchealth.org/provider/michelle-barron-md/"&gt;Dr. Michelle Barron&lt;/a&gt;, UCHealth’s senior medical director for infection control and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s not insignificant,” said Barron, who is also a &lt;a id="" href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/8603" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;professor of medicine and infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a id="" href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;University of Colorado School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.uchealth.org/locations/uchealth-at-university-of-colorado-anschutz-medical-campus/"&gt;Anschutz Campus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the “K” variant, which soon could become dominant in the U.S., appears to be especially good at evading vaccines and bypassing our bodies’ immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This year’s flu shot isn’t perfect, but you should still get it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though this year’s flu shot is a “mismatch” for the “K” variant, that doesn’t mean you should skip getting flu vaccines for yourself and your family members, Barron said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a flu shot still protects people from getting severely ill or dying if they get the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why Barron’s advice is simple and clear. If you haven’t gotten your flu shot yet or made an appointment to get your kids vaccinated, do it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s never too late. Now that we’re seeing an uptick in flu cases, it’s a great time to go get your vaccine because the numbers will continue to rise,” Barron said. “You’re going to need that extra level of protection as more people get sick and as more people will be traveling or having visitors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barron encouraged people to enjoy fun times with family and friends rather than picking up a lousy respiratory virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The worst part of the holiday season is if you’re sick and stuck in bed. You want to be able to go out and enjoy the holidays,” Barron said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the flu, we asked Barron for answers to your top questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you expect the 2025-2026 respiratory virus season to be bad for the flu? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusion about vaccines is driving down vaccination rates. When fewer people are protected, viruses can spread more easily and make more people sick, Barron said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates are lower across the board, and some people who don’t want COVID-19 vaccines are also skipping flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barron encourages people to talk with their providers and get both their flu and COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Flu is a separate virus (from the one that causes COVID-19),” Barron said. “People are going to get really sick from the flu this year. The very young, the very old and people with underlying medical conditions are at the greatest risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uchealth.org/today/flu-in-colorado-what-to-do-if-youre-feeling-lousy/"&gt;Last year’s flu season&lt;/a&gt; also was very severe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 27,000 to 130,000 &lt;a id="" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;people died&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. due to the flu. And a record number of children — at least 279 — died of confirmed flu cases during the 2024 and 2025 flu season, &lt;a id="" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to data&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Nearly all of these children previously were healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting vaccines can help prevent the tragic deaths of young and old people alike. That’s why Barron said it’s so critical for people to get their vaccines now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What new flu virus is going around? How did the ‘K’ variant develop, and should I worry about it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s normal for viruses to change. As they spread, they mutate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple strains of the influenza A and B viruses; however, in general, there are specific strains that emerge and cause yearly outbreaks that give rise to our traditional flu season, which can stretch from September through April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common influenza A strains that are circulating these days are H1N1 and H3N2. This year, the H3N2 strain changed more than it typically does, and multiple mutations have given birth to the “K” variant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re like copying errors,” Barron said. “It has a number of mutations. This is common. Flu mutates all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the timing of the “K” strain’s emergence has been challenging. Vaccine makers already had created flu shots. This year’s version includes components that will allow your immune system to fight H3N2 strains, but they don’t specifically fight the “K” variant because it’s too new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barron says the “K” variant is complicating the ability of this year’s flu shot to fight the flu. She said it’s like mailing a package to someone but using the wrong ZIP code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You change one number on the ZIP code, and it could send your mail next door, down the street or 50 miles away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a vaccine, the “ZIP code” tells your body exactly where to hunt down intruders that can make you sick. If the vaccine has bad directions and is hunting for an older version of the H3N2 strain, you’ll get some protection, but the vaccine may not fully protect you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The vaccines still work. Your body will know that the virus is present. But these mutations can evade your immune system. When the strains in the vaccine don’t match what is circulating in the community, you have a vaccine mismatch,” Barron said. “The flu shot still protects you. When it’s a mismatch, you might get sick, but the vaccine decreases the likelihood that you will be hospitalized and decreases the likelihood that you will die from complications of the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges related to the “K” variant and the way that it has behaved in other countries have sparked concern for infectious disease experts like Barron. She and many other pros are keeping a close eye on how the “K” variant will affect flu cases here in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Colorado, when doctors test hospital patients for the flu (and other respiratory viruses), they send the lab samples to experts at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Workers at the state lab then test the samples to determine exactly which strains of the flu are spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the majority of flu samples that lab workers are testing have been the subclade “K” strain. (&lt;a id="" href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/viral-respiratory-diseases-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;View data&lt;/a&gt; about influenza and other respiratory viruses from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How concerned are you about the drop in flu shots and decreased rates for other vaccines?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barron is very concerned that vaccination rates are declining, and more people will get sick and will need to be hospitalized. Some will die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing a lot less uptake of the flu vaccine than we’ve seen historically, and that’s not a good trend, especially because we know these vaccines (flu and COVID-19) are very good and reduce the severity of illness,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barron strongly encourages anyone who has doubts about vaccines to speak directly with their medical providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The vaccine misinformation is not based on sound science, and it’s causing a lot of distrust,” Barron said. “My hope is that people will still consult with their providers. They know you and the nuances about your health. When they make a recommendation for you — whether it’s to get a flu vaccine or COVID-19 or a pneumonia shot, it’s because they know you and they want to keep you healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the greatest concern as we head into what could be a tough flu season?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barron said it’s particularly heartbreaking to see children die of the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These were generally healthy kids. Parents may think a flu shot is not a big deal. But even healthy kids have immune systems that are not as mature. And that just makes them more vulnerable,” she said. “It distresses me greatly when parents don’t fully understand the risks and don’t get their children vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why her message is so simple. Go get vaccines for yourself and your kids. Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

"Everything in my life got better, and I feel like everyone deserves to meet their sober selves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gants encouraged others to seek out &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sober activities&lt;/a&gt; that bring them joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not everything about sobriety is rainbows and butterflies. It was hard to get here," she said. "Sobriety is worth the upfront investment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 2: Ramping up protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second change Gants made was adding more &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;protein to her diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For me personally, wrapping my head around eating more of something is so much easier than saying, ‘I'm not eating carbs, I'm not eating sugar,’" she said. "I didn't cut out anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adding more protein to your daily meals helps with muscle gain and satiety, experts confirm.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I allowed myself the sweet treats, I allowed myself the bread, whatever I wanted, really, but I tried to eat more protein, and it is like a magic potion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gants noted that protein helps her stay fuller longer while building muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Protein is so good for you, and it's such an easy thing mentally to wrap your head around," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 3: Embracing strength training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fitness, Gants revealed the third change she made to her routine was weightlifting, which she called the "life hack to fitness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can do your Pilates, your yoga, your walking … but &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the weightlifting&lt;/a&gt; is truly life-changing," she said. "You have never seen your body as good as it can look until you've tried weightlifting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/diabetes-prevention-linked-specific-type-exercise-study-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIABETES PREVENTION LINKED TO SPECIFIC TYPE OF EXERCISE, STUDY SHOWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that lifting weights doesn’t require too much time — only 15 to 30 minutes, three days per week at the gym led to changes in her body composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also, strength is tied to longevity, so it's just good for you in general," Gants said. "Give it a try, mix in some walking. Those three things helped me lose the 50 pounds with very little effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;‘Somewhere in the middle’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Balazs, a hormone and weight loss specialist in New Jersey, reacted to Gants' weight loss routine in an interview with Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The truth is somewhere in the middle," he said. "Weightlifting together with a higher intake of protein creates more muscle mass. Additionally, muscle mass memory can come back easily when you stop drinking and live a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;healthier life&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption "actively opposes" &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; by adding empty calories, halting the burning of fat, encouraging fat storage, increasing appetite and reducing inhibitions that lead to poor food choices, according to Balazs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking alcohol can also disrupt the body’s natural recovery and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sleep cycle&lt;/a&gt;, which can also interrupt hormones and increase the risk of sleep apnea, he added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Quitting drinking helped kick-start Gants' weight loss journey, she shared.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasting weight loss occurs through sustaining a calorie deficit, which a high-protein diet can help facilitate, Balazs noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Weightlifting ensures the weight that is lost is fat and not muscle," he said. "All of this together decreases cortisol, which is the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stress hormone&lt;/a&gt; and biggest enemy of weight loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to balanced exercise, Dr. Sarah Towne, a family medicine physician with PlushCare, encouraged a balanced diet with fruits and vegetables for a healthy intake of vitamins, fiber and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"You need protein, but you also need whole, plant-based foods."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You need protein but not just protein; you also need whole, plant-based foods," the North Carolina-based expert told Fox News Digital. "Cutting out junk food helps curb cravings and reduces the … onset of metabolic disasters &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;like diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When it comes to sustainable weight management, whole foods and lean proteins (skinless chicken, fish, beans) are crucial," the doctor added.

"I didn't cut out anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adding more protein to your daily meals helps with muscle gain and satiety, experts confirm.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I allowed myself the sweet treats, I allowed myself the bread, whatever I wanted, really, but I tried to eat more protein, and it is like a magic potion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gants noted that protein helps her stay fuller longer while building muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Protein is so good for you, and it's such an easy thing mentally to wrap your head around," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 3: Embracing strength training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fitness, Gants revealed the third change she made to her routine was weightlifting, which she called the "life hack to fitness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can do your Pilates, your yoga, your walking … but &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the weightlifting&lt;/a&gt; is truly life-changing," she said. "You have never seen your body as good as it can look until you've tried weightlifting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/diabetes-prevention-linked-specific-type-exercise-study-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIABETES PREVENTION LINKED TO SPECIFIC TYPE OF EXERCISE, STUDY SHOWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that lifting weights doesn’t require too much time — only 15 to 30 minutes, three days per week at the gym led to changes in her body composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also, strength is tied to longevity, so it's just good for you in general," Gants said. "Give it a try, mix in some walking. Those three things helped me lose the 50 pounds with very little effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;‘Somewhere in the middle’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Balazs, a hormone and weight loss specialist in New Jersey, reacted to Gants' weight loss routine in an interview with Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The truth is somewhere in the middle," he said. "Weightlifting together with a higher intake of protein creates more muscle mass. Additionally, muscle mass memory can come back easily when you stop drinking and live a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;healthier life&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption "actively opposes" &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; by adding empty calories, halting the burning of fat, encouraging fat storage, increasing appetite and reducing inhibitions that lead to poor food choices, according to Balazs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking alcohol can also disrupt the body’s natural recovery and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sleep cycle&lt;/a&gt;, which can also interrupt hormones and increase the risk of sleep apnea, he added,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Quitting drinking helped kick-start Gants' weight loss journey, she shared.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasting weight loss occurs through sustaining a calorie deficit, which a high-protein diet can help facilitate, Balazs noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Weightlifting ensures the weight that is lost is fat and not muscle," he said. "All of this together decreases cortisol, which is the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stress hormone&lt;/a&gt; and biggest enemy of weight loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to balanced exercise, Dr. Sarah Towne, a family medicine physician with PlushCare, encouraged a balanced diet with fruits and vegetables for a healthy intake of vitamins, fiber and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"You need protein, but you also need whole, plant-based foods."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You need protein but not just protein; you also need whole, plant-based foods," the North Carolina-based expert told Fox News Digital.

Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The Northeast Public Health Collaborative and the West Coast Health Alliance, which formed earlier this year in response to Kennedy’s concerning overhaul of &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/vaccines/"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; policy, along with a other blue states, plan to to defy the latest recommendations made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rfk-jrs-vaccine-panel-votes-down-its-own-proposal-to-require-prescriptions-for-covid-19-shots/"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;, or ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Hepatitis B is a serious, incurable infection that can lead to liver damage and liver cancer. It can be passed from mother to child during delivery, and without vaccination, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/perinatal-provider-overview/index.html"&gt;about 90 percent of infants&lt;/a&gt; infected at birth develop chronic hepatitis B infection. Among those with chronic infection, 25 percent will die prematurely from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Since 1991, ACIP and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended a universal dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours after birth. The sooner a newborn gets the vaccine, the higher the chance of preventing chronic infection. The birth dose is credited with dramatically lowering infection rates in children. Yet last week, Kennedy’s newly formed ACIP, which includes &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/rfk-announces-new-acip-members-including-vaccine-critics" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/rfk-announces-new-acip-members-including-vaccine-critics"}' href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/rfk-announces-new-acip-members-including-vaccine-critics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;several vaccine skeptics&lt;/a&gt;, overturned that 30-year precedent. In June, Kennedy announced a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/wsj-kennedy-op-ed-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines.html"&gt;“clean sweep”&lt;/a&gt; of ACIP, removing all of its previous 17 experts and replacing them with new members of his choosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;During a chaotic two-day meeting that was riddled with misinformation, the committee voted to recommend the hepatitis B vaccine at birth only for infants born to pregnant people who test positive for the virus or whose status is unknown. For those whose hepatitis B status is negative, the panel recommended “individual-based decision-making”—meaning parents should talk with their doctors about vaccination first. If the baby does not receive the first dose at birth, the panel suggests delaying the first dose until the child is at least two months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Medical experts have decried the decision, saying that screening across the US is imperfect and does not catch all infections. Half of people who have it &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html"&gt;don’t know that they’re infected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The United States went through several iterations of recommendations for vaccinating against hepatitis B that were all risk-based. We tried screening mothers, we tried only vaccinating babies born to mothers living with hepatitis B, and they all failed. The universal birth dose was the ultimate success and the reason why we've seen childhood hepatitis B cases decline by 99 percent since we implemented it,” says Michaela Jackson, director of prevention policy at the Hepatitis B Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 19:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPZ21kcGx2c1I4UVhmemFVajFfV0tUMk5zUEdXWUhxVjQtbW1ROVRqSncxd2RGT0hrVlZBUTlfeWMyd01BandxdEMzYldXMlAwSFdOTEFHZUV4REVwRE5QRXo4eEphTFNwODB4MXVRZ2VFZ2d0QzUxNjdZNmVlTDhuOGF1c3BNdFRCNlpjWGhZRTVvbVBFMTQ4X1hHYklnbmZK</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心表示，密歇根州男子死于狂犬病感染的肾脏移植-福克斯2底特律</title><link>https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/michigan-man-dies-from-rabies-infected-kidney-transplant-cdc-says</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" data-v-3646484b&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOX 2&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/span&gt;A Michigan man died from a kidney transplant due to a believed rabies virus infection last year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p original-article-post="" origination_station="WJBK" data-v-ec26887a data-v-3646484b&gt;Timeline:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails" data-v-3646484b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-js" data-v-3646484b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt" data-v-3646484b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;The strange deaths of the human-to-human rabies transmission was reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which became aware of the cases January 27, 2025.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;This was the fourth transplant-transmitted rabies event in the United States since 1978, according to the CDC.

Rabies is almost always fatal without timely receipt of postexposure prophylaxis&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;In 2024 a Michigan resident received a left kidney transplant from an Idaho donor at an Ohio hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;He died seven days later with the rabies virus RNA was detected in saliva, nuchal skin, and brain tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;The Rabies virus immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG, and neutralizing antibodies were detected in serum, the CDC said.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p original-article-post="" origination_station="WJBK" data-v-ec26887a data-v-3646484b&gt;The Idaho donor:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;When the donor was investigated, it was revealed he was injured by a skunk he was defending a kitten from, in October of 2024.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;Two days after he showed rabies symptoms in December, he was found unresponsive at home after presumed cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;He was resuscitated and hospitalized but never regained consciousness.

Michigan public health officials interviewed the kidney recipient’s family; no animal exposures were reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;Interviews with the family added details not included in the organ donation questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-3646484b&gt;The skunk interaction happened as the donor held a kitten on his rural property.

Scientists on Wednesday reported that they have identified a pair of immune signals they believe drive these cases — and offered early evidence that these signals can be blocked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers sifted through previous Covid vaccine studies and identified a pair of immune signaling molecules, or cytokines, present at higher levels in the blood of vaccine recipients with myocarditis: CXCL10 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). The authors found that these signals could also be triggered in the lab when immune cells were exposed to the Pfizer and Moderna Covid vaccines, or when mice were inoculated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists found that using antibodies to block CXCL10 and IFN-γ reduced signs of cardiac stress in vaccinated mice and in cardiac spheroids, three-dimensional growths of human cells meant to mimic some aspects of the heart’s structure and function. The authors also found they could block the cytokines’ effects with genistein, a compound found in soybeans and other legumes that has &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35489334/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to reduced inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adq0143" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Science Translational Medicine, come as messenger RNA vaccines face scrutiny from the Trump administration and some lawmakers. That has forced researchers studying these shots to strike a tricky balancing act between reporting new insights on adverse events while making clear that the shots are safe overall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I want to emphasize this is very, very rare. This study is purely to understand why. In those rare cases, what’s going on? People talk about it, and here we provide a mechanism,” said Joe Wu, director of Stanford Cardiovascular Institute and the study’s senior author.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Kathyrn Edwards, a professor emerita at Vanderbilt University and a veteran vaccine researcher who was not involved in the new study, noted that the mouse findings come with caveats, as animals in the study received higher vaccine doses relative to their body size than vaccinated people. Wu acknowledged the point, adding that the research team used a higher vaccine dose to ensure that the animals would develop myocarditis. Otherwise, he estimates, it might have taken a whopping 20,000 mice to see the rare adverse event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Billions of doses of mRNA vaccine have been administered worldwide against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including in countries with large, centralized health systems, such as &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(24)00276-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47745-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50656-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2109730" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. Data from those countries and the U.S. allowed researchers to spot cases of chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations in some recently vaccinated people. These symptoms, which were mostly mild, appear after about 7 out of every million first vaccine doses. The frequency rises to 31 cases out of every million second doses, and 60 out of every million doses among men under 30.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection causes myocarditis at much higher rates than immunization, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e5.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; 1,500 cases per million Covid-19 patients. Cases caused by infection also tend to be more severe than those induced by immunization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While researchers initially hypothesized that vaccine-induced myocarditis might be caused by an allergic response to the shots or autoimmunity,&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/05/05/myocarditis-covid-vaccines-study/"&gt; more recent research&lt;/a&gt; has pointed to inflammatory proteins. To better understand which of these signals are most important, a team led by Stanford scientists analyzed data from a pair of previous studies that collected blood from vaccinated individuals. Researchers found that CXCL10 and IFN-γ were more abundant in patients with myocarditis than in vaccinated people who didn’t develop the condition. They also saw that these cytokines ramped up within the first couple days after immunization — around the time myocarditis symptoms appear. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03791-x/figures/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that levels of these cytokines drop a few weeks after vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further experiments with lab-grown immune cells suggested that CXCL10 was mainly made by &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/28/miriam-merad-macrophages-immune-system-cancer/"&gt;macrophages&lt;/a&gt;, cells that act as sentries in scouring for signs of infection and sounding the alarm. The CXCL10 they produce acts like breadcrumbs for immune cells, guiding them toward an infection site. IFN-γ, which plays a range of roles in beefing up antiviral defenses, was mainly made by T cells, which like generals shape the size and strategy of an immune response. When heart muscle cells were exposed to these cytokines in the lab, they struggled to contract rhythmically — suggesting that the immune messengers may impair the heart’s ability to supply the body with oxygenated blood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors then tested whether blocking these cytokines could prevent myocarditis. They gave mice two shots of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, with some of the animals also receiving antibodies that block CXCL10 and IFN-γ. Immunized animals given the antibodies had lower circulating levels of cardiac troponin, a protein that’s a telltale sign of heart damage when found in the blood. These mice also had fewer immune cells wending their way through heart tissue than animals only given the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that genistein had the same effect as using these blocking antibodies, blunting myocarditis in inoculated mice and in cells grown in the lab. The authors tested the molecule in part because they suspected sex hormones might help explain why males are more likely to experience myocarditis (genistein mimics the effects of estrogen). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eric Topol, a cardiologist and geneticist who directs Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study offers some of the best evidence yet to explain what triggers myocarditis in some vaccinated people. But he added that some questions linger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was convinced by what they presented,” said Topol, who was not part of the study. “What I’m still left with is, why? Why does the mRNA lead to these cytokine disruptions?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wu’s group is now exploring whether genistein could one day be used to prevent or treat myocarditis. The compound is sold as a dietary supplement and found in foods such as tofu, but the preparation used in the recent study was more concentrated than what you’d find at the store. Wu and colleagues are looking to see if they can tweak genistein so that more of it ends up in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This work comes at a fraught time for mRNA vaccines. Some state legislatures have looked to ban mRNA vaccines, and the Trump administration has cancelled&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/05/mrna-vaccine-development-canceled-by-kennedy-hhs/"&gt; $500 million in contracts&lt;/a&gt; for research into shots based on the technology. Earlier this year, a Senate subcommittee held a hearing on, as it put it, “The Corruption of Science and Federal Health Agencies: How Health Officials Downplayed and Hid Myocarditis and Other Adverse Events Associated with the COVID-19 Vaccines.” More recently, the Food and Drug Administration’s top vaccine regulator&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/29/covid-vaccine-deaths-fda-memo-vinay-prasad/"&gt; claimed&lt;/a&gt; Covid-19 vaccines caused the deaths of at least 10 children, though it’s unclear if those cases involved myocarditis and experts are skeptical of the agency’s assertion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Edwards worries these moves aren’t backed by sound science and could undermine public health. But she noted that there is value in studies such as this latest paper that rigorously study vaccine side effects, even rare ones.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We really shouldn’t throw the baby out with the bath water when the vaccines were highly effective,” she said. “If we could figure out why [myocarditis] happens, if we can mitigate it so that we could use the vaccine so that nobody gets it, that would be great as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

These clusters draw on social-rule knowledge, understanding of how the physical world works, and sensitivity to speech intonation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants performed similarly across tasks within each cluster, indicating shared underlying mechanisms for how the brain interprets meaning beyond literal words. The findings outline a new framework for studying communication differences, including those seen across cultures and in neurodivergent populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Core Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Pragmatic skills grouped into social-context inferences, physical-world reasoning, and tone-based meaning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context Shapes Meaning:&lt;/strong&gt; Identical sentences carried different interpretations depending on timing, tone, and situational cues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; Framework may clarify communication challenges in autism and cultural variations in indirect speech.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In everyday conversation, it’s critical to understand not just the words that are spoken, but the context in which they are said. If it’s pouring rain and someone remarks on the “lovely weather,” you won’t understand their meaning unless you realize that they’re being sarcastic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making inferences about what someone really means when it doesn’t match the literal meaning of their words is a skill known as pragmatic language ability. This includes not only interpreting sarcasm but also understanding metaphors and white lies, among many other conversational subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pragmatics is trying to reason about why somebody might say something, and what is the message they’re trying to convey given that they put it in this particular way,” says Evelina Fedorenko, an MIT associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences and a member of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from Fedorenko and her colleagues has revealed that these abilities can be grouped together based on what types of inferences they require. In a study of 800 people, the researchers identified three clusters of pragmatic skills that are based on the same kinds of inferences and may have similar underlying neural processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of these clusters includes inferences that are based on our knowledge of social conventions and rules. Another depends on knowledge of how the physical world works, while the last requires the ability to interpret differences in tone, which can indicate emphasis or emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fedorenko and Edward Gibson, an MIT professor of brain and cognitive sciences, are the senior authors of the study, which appears in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper’s lead authors are Sammy Floyd, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor of psychology at Sarah Lawrence College, and Olessia Jouravlev, a former MIT postdoc who is now an associate professor of cognitive science at Carleton University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The importance of context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much past research on how people understand language has focused on processing the literal meanings of words and how they fit together. To really understand what someone is saying, however, we need to interpret those meanings based on context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Language is about getting meanings across, and that often requires taking into account many different kinds of information — such as the social context, the visual context, or the present topic of the conversation,” Fedorenko says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one example, the phrase “people are leaving” can mean different things depending on the context, Gibson points out. If it’s late at night and someone asks you how a party is going, you may say “people are leaving,” to convey that the party is ending and everyone’s going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, if it’s early, and I say ‘people are leaving,’ then the implication is that the party isn’t very good,” Gibson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you say a sentence, there’s a literal meaning to it, but how you interpret that literal meaning depends on the context.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 10 years ago, with support from the Simons Center for the Social Brain at MIT, Fedorenko and Gibson decided to explore whether it might be possible to precisely distinguish the types of processing that go into pragmatic language skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way that neuroscientists can approach a question like this is to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the brains of participants as they perform different tasks. This allows them to link brain activity in different locations to different functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the tasks that the researchers designed for this study didn’t easily lend themselves to being performed in a scanner, so they took an alternative approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach, known as “individual differences,” involves studying a large number of people as they perform a variety of tasks. This technique allows researchers to determine whether the same underlying brain processes may be responsible for performance on different tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, the researchers evaluate whether each participant tends to perform similarly on certain groups of tasks. For example, some people might perform well on tasks that require an understanding of social conventions, such as interpreting indirect requests and irony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same people might do only so-so on tasks that require understanding how the physical world works, and poorly on tasks that require distinguishing meanings based on changes in intonation — the melody of speech. This would suggest that separate brain processes are being recruited for each set of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first phase of the study was led by Jouravlev, who assembled existing tasks that require pragmatic skills and created many more, for a total of 20. These included tasks that require people to understand humor and sarcasm, as well as tasks where changes in intonation can affect the meaning of a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, someone who says “I wanted blue and black socks,” with emphasis on the word “black,” is implying that the black socks were forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People really find ways to communicate creatively and indirectly and non-literally, and this battery of tasks captures that,” Floyd says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Components of pragmatic ability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited study participants from an online crowdsourcing platform to perform the tasks, which took about eight hours to complete. From this first set of 400 participants, the researchers found that the tasks formed three clusters, related to social context, general knowledge of the world, and intonation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the robustness of the findings, the researchers continued the study with another set of 400 participants, with this second half run by Floyd after Jouravlev had left MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the second set of participants, the researchers found that tasks clustered into the same three groups. They also confirmed that differences in general intelligence, or in auditory processing ability (which is important for the processing of intonation), did not affect the outcomes that they observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future work, the researchers hope to use brain imaging to explore whether the pragmatic components they identified are correlated with activity in different brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous work has found that brain imaging often mirrors the distinctions identified in individual difference studies, but can also help link the relevant abilities to specific neural systems, such as the core language system or the theory of mind system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This set of tests could also be used to study people with autism, who sometimes have difficulty understanding certain social cues. Such studies could determine more precisely the nature and extent of these difficulties. Another possibility could be studying people who were raised in different cultures, which may have different norms around speaking directly or indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In Russian, which happens to be my native language, people are more direct. So perhaps there might be some differences in how native speakers of Russian process indirect requests compared to speakers of English,” Jouravlev says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Simons Center for the Social Brain at MIT, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1765392000856"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What exactly are pragmatic language skills?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; They include understanding sarcasm, indirect requests, metaphors, white lies, and any meaning that depends on context rather than literal wording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1765392002232"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why did the skills cluster into three groups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Because each relies on different inference systems: social norms, world knowledge, or interpretation of tone and emphasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1765392002016"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How can this new framework be used?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It provides a structured way to study communication differences in both neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals and across cultures with different conversational norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this cognition, language, and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fe8da1939d9abe93978ad09b9a8b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sarah McDonnell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sarah McDonnell – MIT&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2424400122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Three distinct components of pragmatic language use: Social conventions, intonation, and world knowledge–based causal reasoning&lt;/a&gt;” by Evelina Fedorenko et al. &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three distinct components of pragmatic language use: Social conventions, intonation, and world knowledge–based causal reasoning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful communication requires frequent inferences. Such inferences span a multitude of phenomena: from understanding metaphors, to detecting irony and getting jokes, to interpreting intonation patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do all these inferences draw on a single underlying cognitive ability, or does our capacity for nonliteral language comprehension fractionate into dissociable components?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an approach that has successfully uncovered structure in other domains of cognition, we examined covariation in behavioral performance on diverse nonliteral comprehension tasks across two large samples to search for shared and distinct components of pragmatic language use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 1, n = 376 participants each completed an 8 h battery of 20 critical tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controlling for general cognitive ability, an exploratory factor analysis revealed three clusters, which can be post hoc interpreted as corresponding to i) understanding social conventions (critical for phenomena such as indirect requests, conversational implicatures, and irony), ii) interpreting contrastive and emotional intonation patterns, and iii) making causal inferences based on world knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This structure largely replicated in a new sample of n = 400 participants (Experiment 2, preregistered) and was robust to analytic choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research uncovers structure in the human communication toolkit and can inform our understanding of pragmatic difficulties in individuals with brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hypotheses put forward here about the underlying cognitive abilities can now be evaluated in new behavioral studies, as well as using brain imaging and computational modeling, to continue deciphering the ontology of the component pieces of linguistic and nonverbal communication.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 18:44:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1GNmEtb2NMQ0U4Q3N2bWpuMnZaXzFQbTR1WTBaX1BhSWZId014VC1IV2FuY0JBQTJHWW5BLWREYmNZODh2YnlrVXRwZmw3T1Z3Z3phVUo4clplT0lhTUltcTRoZ1JtMzZJYUhTQXFNbU5BUQ</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州数百人被隔离，麻疹疫情接近严峻的里程碑- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/u-s-measles-outbreak-nears-grim-milestone-as-hundreds-quarantine-in-south-carolina-2000697900</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Department of Public Health reported 27 new cases of measles on Tuesday, all identified since last Friday, bringing the total number of identified cases in the state this year to 114. There are currently at least 254 people in quarantine in South Carolina, though the problem isn’t just confined to one state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The latest figures from the CDC, which haven’t been updated in over a week and don’t include hundreds of recent cases, indicate there have been 1,828 confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. this year as of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;December 2&lt;/a&gt;. Three people have died from measles in 2025, two kids and one adult, the first deaths from the disease in this country since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The U.S. officially eliminated measles as an endemic disease in the year 2000, thanks to the widespread vaccination programs of the 20th century. But America’s federal public health infrastructure saw a hostile takeover by anti-vaccine activists in January, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his so-called Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There have been 46 measles outbreaks identified in the U.S. in 2025, and 87% of confirmed cases have been associated with outbreaks, according to the CDC. An outbreak is defined as three or more cases of the same disease linked to a common source. If the outbreaks continue into January 2026, it will mark a year since they began in &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/measles-is-rampaging-through-rural-texas-dozens-sick-hundreds-feared-infected-2000564981"&gt;West Texas&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. will then officially lose its &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/canada-will-soon-lose-its-hard-won-measles-free-status-america-is-next-2000678788"&gt;measles-free status&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The latest confirmed cases in South Carolina&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Department of Public Health first identified an outbreak in the state’s Upstate region on October 2, starting with eight cases, mostly concentrated in Spartanburg County. That number has grown to &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-27-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-111"&gt;111 cases&lt;/a&gt; in the area, which makes up the vast majority of the 114 cases in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The public exposure sites in South Carolina have included Inman Intermediate School, where 43 students are currently in quarantine. Students at the school, which has kids in 4th-6th grade, first went into quarantine December 4 and will be able to return to class on December 15 if they don’t become ill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sixteen of the new cases reported on Tuesday come from Way of Truth Church in Inman, with eight of those cases coming from household exposures to measles. One new case of measles came from “exposure in a health care setting,” according to the South Carolina Department of Public Health, though more details about that case were not released. The agency encourages those who’ve been potentially exposed to measles to notify their health care provider before coming in so that proper arrangements can be made to protect others.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The age breakdown of South Carolina’s known measles cases in 2025 has included: Under 5 years old (20), 5-17 (75), 18+: 10. There have been 6 minors whose ages haven’t been disclosed to public health officials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Importantly, 105 of the measles cases identified in South Carolina have been from people who were unvaccinated. Three cases have been in people who were partially vaccinated, receiving just one dose of the recommended two-dose MMR shots. Just one person in the state’s outbreak was fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;New cases in Utah and Arizona&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Utah Department of Health and Human Services has identified 115 measles cases this year, with 26 cases identified in the past three weeks, according to the agency’s &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/"&gt;online dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new case was reported Monday at the Bingham Kooper Kids childcare facility, located inside Bingham High School in the city of South Jordan. The person was unvaccinated, according to local news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.abc4.com/news/health/measles-cases-115-new-exposure-locations/"&gt;ABC4&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s unclear where the person was initially infected and whether they were a child or an adult.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There’s a long list of potential measles exposure &lt;a href="https://www.abc4.com/news/health/measles-cases-115-new-exposure-locations/"&gt;locations&lt;/a&gt; in Utah, including two elementary schools, a junior high school, a high school, two emergency rooms, a Walmart, and the Treehouse Children’s Museum in Ogden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Utah’s measles cases have been concentrated in the southwest region of the state, where it shares a border with Arizona, a state that has identified 23 of its own cases in the past two weeks. Arizona has seen 176 measles cases this year, with 97% of cases in unvaccinated patients, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php"&gt;Arizona Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt;. Sixty-six percent of cases in Arizona have occurred in people under the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;RFK Jr.’s anti-vaccine nonsense&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has been officially consumed by far-right activists ever since President Donald Trump took power in January. Trump nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, and he quickly worked to radically alter the country’s vaccine policies.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To take just some recent examples, Kennedy has claimed without evidence that peanut allergies are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-is-now-blaming-vaccines-on-peanut-allergies-despite-the-evidence-2000689593"&gt;caused by vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, and he’s installed anti-vaccine activist &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-taps-preacher-who-blames-vaccines-for-cancer-compares-covid-tracking-to-nazi-germany-2000694531"&gt;Kirk Milhoan&lt;/a&gt; as the chair of the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to remove a recommendation that all children be vaccinated against hepatitis B &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/we-are-doing-harm-rfk-jr-s-acip-guts-universal-hep-b-vaccination-at-birth-2000695747"&gt;from birth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy is grossly unqualified for the job and quite literally doesn’t believe in germ theory. And as long as he and his MAHA buddies are allowed to continue dismantling the country’s public health infrastructure, we’re going to see more cases of measles, a disease that can induce something called “immune amnesia.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s immune amnesia? It’s when your immune system forgets how to fight the pathogens it successfully &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/measles-infection-can-cause-immune-amnesia"&gt;fought off before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

This “three-hit” metabolic model reframes autism as a disorder of disrupted cellular communication and energy metabolism rather than an inevitable genetic outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By showing that two of the three factors are potentially reversible, the research suggests that early-life screening and metabolic interventions could reduce or prevent a substantial proportion of cases. The model integrates findings across mitochondrial biology, immune signaling, and neural circuit development to offer a unified biological framework for autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Biological Hits:&lt;/strong&gt; Genetic sensitivity, early environmental stress, and a prolonged cell danger response interact to shape autism risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic Signaling Core:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic purinergic signaling and disrupted mitochondrial function may alter early neural circuit development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Early detection of metabolic stress could reduce or prevent up to half of autism cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new University of California San Diego School of Medicine study offers a unified biological model to explain how genetic predispositions and environmental exposures converge to cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Mitochondrion&lt;/em&gt; on Dec. 9, 2025, describes a “three-hit” metabolic signaling model that reframes autism as a treatable disorder of cellular communication and energy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model also suggests that as many as half of all autism cases might be prevented or reduced with prenatal and early-life interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that autism is not the inevitable result of any one gene or exposure, but the outcome of a series of biological interactions, many of which can be modified,” said study author Robert K. Naviaux, M.D., Ph.D., professor of medicine, pediatrics and pathology at UC San Diego School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By understanding how these genetic and environmental factors stack to alter a child’s developmental trajectory, we can start to imagine preventive care and new approaches to treatment that were previously thought impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three-hit model, developed from more than a decade of systems biology research, proposes that autism develops when three conditions align:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetic predisposition: Inherited genes can make mitochondria and certain cellular signaling pathways unusually sensitive to change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early trigger: Environmental exposures — such as maternal or early infant infection, immune stress or pollution — can activate a universal cellular stress response, called the cell danger response (CDR).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prolonged activation: When this cellular stress response stays switched on for too long — typically because of repeated or ongoing exposure to stressors from late pregnancy through the first two to three years of life — it can interfere with normal brain development and lead to ASD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the center of this model is the CDR, a metabolic process that helps cells heal from injury or infection, respond to threats and adapt to changing conditions. The CDR is normally short-lived: it turns on to promote healing and turns off once the danger has passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when the response becomes chronic — due to persistent stressors or inherited hypersensitivity — it can disrupt cellular communication and alter mitochondrial function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens through changes in extracellular ATP (eATP) – related purinergic signaling — chemical signals that cells use to communicate stress and coordinate healing — which can interfere with how brain circuits form during early life and contribute to the core features of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Behavior has a chemical basis,” said Naviaux. “The CDR regulates that chemistry. When it remains activated too long, it diverts the body’s resources from normal growth and development toward cellular defense, leaving fewer resources for the developing brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This systems-level framework integrates decades of findings about autism — from mitochondrial and immune dysfunction to gut microbiome changes and sensory hypersensitivity — into a single biological narrative. It helps explain why both genes and environment play roles in autism risk, and why neither alone is sufficient to cause the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naviaux argues that this perspective shifts the search away from a single “autism gene” toward understanding how diverse stressors converge on common biochemical pathways. “The same signaling systems that allow cells to respond to injury or infection also regulate the formation of neural circuits in early development,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the second and third “hits” — environmental triggers and prolonged activation of the CDR — are potentially reversible, early detection and intervention could dramatically reduce autism risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate how multiple metabolic hits can stack to cause disease, Naviaux compares autism to phenylketonuria (PKU), a classical genetic disorder that causes intellectual disability if untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PKU also follows the three-hit metabolic model: if detected and treated early, 95% of affected children develop normally despite carrying a disease-causing gene. Similarly, Naviaux estimates that if pregnancies and infants at highest risk for autism can be identified and supported early, 40–50% of cases might be prevented or significantly improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential strategies include presymptomatic screening, such as maternal metabolomic profiling, autoantibody testing and specialized newborn analyses to identify at-risk children before symptoms appear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study arrives amid rising autism prevalence and ongoing debate over its causes. By reframing ASD as a neurometabolic and neuroimmune condition — rather than a strictly genetic or behavioral one — Naviaux hopes to bridge scientific silos and encourage new collaborations in prevention and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research, he said, should focus on refining diagnostic tools that can detect metabolic stress before symptoms appear and on testing therapies that rebalance the body’s energy and signaling systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naviaux calls for the development of new antipurinergic drugs to regulate the abnormal ATP signaling that triggers and maintains the CDR. Larger, multi-site clinical trials are also needed to evaluate these new drugs and metabolic support strategies in children with ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also advocates for prenatal and early-life screening programs that combine genetics, metabolomics and environmental data to identify at-risk families sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these efforts could help determine whether calming the cell danger response can prevent or reduce autism’s most disabling features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding autism through the lens of metabolic signaling doesn’t just change how we think about the condition — it changes what we can do about it,” said Naviaux. “If we can recognize and calm the cellular stress response before it becomes chronic, we may be able to improve or even prevent some of the most disabling symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded, in part, by philanthropic gifts to the Naviaux Lab from the UC San Diego Christini Fund, the Lennox Foundation, the William Wright Family Foundation, Malone Family Foundation, the UCSD Mitochondrial Disease Research Fund, Sarika Agrawal, Gita and Anurag Gupta, the Brain Foundation, the Aloe family, the Harb family, Marc Spilo and all the others who contributed to the Aloe family autism research fund, the N of One Autism Research Foundation, the JMS Fund, Linda Clark, Jeanne Conrad, David Cannistraro, the Kirby and Katie Mano Family, Simon and Evelyn Foo, Wing-kun Tam, the Brent Kaufman Family, Fred and Sylvia Fogel, Ian and Rochelle Yankwitt, the Francis H.

'I was far too young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wasn't in a crisis or asking for help, but I think the environment that I was in really only honored one narrow version of "normal", and I just didn't fit that template of how a child was supposed to behave or perform in the classroom setting.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time she left her home in Philadelphia for college, Gansky was on 14 different medications every day, including stimulants Adderall and Concerta, and the antidepressant Prozac. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Danielle Gansky, pictured here as a child, was just seven years old when she was prescribed Ritalin. Over the years, the cascade of medications included more than a dozen different pills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was told I had a chemical imbalance and I needed to treat it, but as I got older, I knew something wasn't right,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wanted to see who I was underneath all these drugs, and I knew I needed to come off them.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After Gansky graduated in 2019, her doctor began to taper her off the cascade of medications over a course of several weeks. But Gansky felt this wasn't enough time to allow her body to adjust. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178125001453"&gt;2025 study&lt;/a&gt; found that a longer duration of antidepressant use, or at least two years, was associated with a greater likelihood of severe withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, stomach cramps, balance issues, mood swings and mania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.pn.2021.9.12"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; suggested people who have been on multiple behavioral and psychiatric medications for several years need to taper off of them over a period of years, not weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[It was] dangerously fast for someone who has been on these drugs long term,' Gansky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was simply harmed by coming off these drugs exactly the way my doctor told me to. And then, what followed was a severe, life-altering, full-body neurological crisis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gansky, pictured at left and right during childhood, told the Daily Mail she was a spunky, energetic child, but doctors were quick to diagnose her with ADHD and medicate her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2020, Gansky had stopped all of the drugs and was thrust into a 'living nightmare of physical and psychological torment' when she developed a condition called akathisia, which can occur after discontinuing antidepressants or antipsychotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The name comes from the Greek word 'akathemi,' which translates to 'inability to sit.' Patients like Gansky suffer such intense restlessness and tension that a burning sensation rips through their bodies, leading to extreme anxiety that drives many to self-harm and suicide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'It completely changed the course of my life,' Gansky said. 'The pain was unlike anything I'd ever known or experienced or thought humanly possible, like my entire nervous system was hijacked.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact cause of akathisia is unclear, experts believe it is due to sudden shifts in neurotransmitters - like dopamine and serotonin - and disrupted pathways as the body adjusts to changes in medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dopamine is key for controlling movement. People with Parkinson's disease, which is caused by the death of dopamine-producing cells, suffer uncontrolled movements due to this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After graduating college in 2019, Gansky decided to start tapering off of her antidepressants. This sent her into extreme withdrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Akathisia is the most common movement disorder associated with psychiatric drug use and withdrawal, according to Mayo Clinic, yet there is no definitive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is unclear how many people have it, but experts estimate about 15 to 35 percent of the 6 million Americans on antipsychotics may suffer from the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While experiencing the akathisia, Gansky was unable to eat and saw snow-like dots in her vision. She could hardly focus between bouts of rage, agitation and 'brain zaps,' and her skin seared with a 'constant sensation of acid being poured' on her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's like a state of internal torture to your nervous system,' she told the Daily Mail. 'It was just chaos, and I was basically bedridden and physically couldn't take care of myself because I couldn't function. It's just chemical torture. I never experienced suffering like that in my life.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gansky told the Daily Mail that her doctor claimed 'withdrawal doesn't exist' and is not possible because the pills 'were out of her system.' He insisted her symptoms were proof she needed to be on her medications and that she was too young to be suffering from such severe withdrawal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs of depression and anxiety, including panic attacks, returned with a vengeance as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt very betrayed,' she said. 'I had to trust him to keep me safe, but his credentials automatically outweighed my lived experience. I was just completely gaslit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gansky, pictured here during childhood, believes a few weeks was not enough time to taper off of her antidepressants after taking them for so many years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gansky eventually checked herself into a hospital, but she claims doctors insisted she was exaggerating and that her symptoms were proof that she needed to be medicated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gansky spent about five months completely bedridden, often waking up from nightmares shaking and screaming on the floor and unable to get dressed, before checking herself into a hospital for in-patient psychiatric care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she claimed that doctors insisted she was exaggerating or just suffering from bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of desperation, Gansky decided to start taking the SSRI fluvoxamine, which is used for OCD and social anxiety, in hopes it would give her her life back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the course of two and a half months on fluvoxamine, her body slowly began to stabilize and allow her to function once again. However, she 'never quite felt right' after initially going through withdrawal and would frequently suffer emotional breakdowns or periods of severe depression and anxiety that lasted for weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gansky claimed that doctors insisted she just needed to go back on the medications she had so desperately tried to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, she said a doctor believed her wanting to taper slowly was a sign of OCD. Another doctor, however, claimed she could go off fluvoxamine 'cold turkey' with no tapering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This led Gansky to stop fluvoxamine without tapering. But in just weeks, 'I basically found myself back in that same withdrawal nightmare again,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within a few months of quitting fluvoxamine, she lost 20 pounds and again felt chained to her bed. Doctors prescribed her olanzapine, sold under the brand name Zyprexa, an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, neither of which Gansky was formally diagnosed with. However, doctors suggested her behavior may have been a sign of bipolar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When taken unnecessarily, medications like Zyprexa can worsen or cause akathisia. For Gansky, it was like suffering from 'a chemical lobotomy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was bedbound for another couple years, and then I was unable to drive or do basic tasks,' she told the Daily Mail. 'I lost my sense of self. I had profound cognitive impairment, memory loss. My creativity, my intelligence, my ability to feel love or joy, everything that made me, me, was gone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had to relearn basic functions.

'For most of my life, my inner reality was dismissed or reinterpreted for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was silenced and dismissed at every turn, and I know so many others are as well.

But a genetic analysis of more than one million people suggests that a host of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02772-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02772-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;psychiatric conditions&lt;/a&gt; have common biological roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, published today in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, reveal that people with seemingly disparate conditions often share many of the same disease-linked genetic variants. The analysis found that 14 major psychiatric disorders &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00922-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00922-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;cluster into five categories&lt;/a&gt;, each characterized by a common set of genetic risk factors. The neurodevelopmental category, for example, includes both &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03855-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03855-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, which psychiatric handbooks classify as separate conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many supposedly individual conditions are “ultimately more overlapping than they are distinct, which should offer patients hope”, says study co-author Andrew Grotzinger, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “You can see the despair on someone’s face [when] you give them five different labels as opposed to one label.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fellow travellers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grotzinger says his team’s work was motivated by the finding that people diagnosed with one mental-health condition are highly likely to be diagnosed with another one. For example, previous research has shown that most people diagnosed with depression have also been diagnosed with a condition called generalized anxiety disorder, and vice versa&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03180-8" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04037-w/d41586-025-04037-w_51535866.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Features of autism can affect age of diagnosis — and so can genes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn whether there is a biological explanation for these correlations, Grotzinger and his colleagues aggregated genomic data from more than one million people with psychiatric conditions and from millions of healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the 14 mental-health conditions they studied generally fall into five distinct buckets, each with its own genetic profile. There’s a schizophrenia/bipolar disorder category; an ‘internalizing’ category that includes depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder; a neurodevelopmental category; and a compulsive category that includes obsessive-compulsive disorder and anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final category includes substance-use disorders such as alcohol-use disorder and nicotine dependence. People whose genetic profile corresponds to a given bucket are at elevated risk of any of the conditions in that bucket. Other genetic and environmental triggers also affect risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk sharing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then worked backwards from the categories that they had identified and found 238 specific genomic regions that are associated with at least one of these shared categories. For example, the researchers found that one region on chromosome 11 raised genetic risk for eight separate disorders, because the region codes for genes linked to dopamine signalling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02210-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04037-w/d41586-025-04037-w_23392166.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Brain-cell growth keeps mood disorders at bay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he ranks of serial killers seem to overflow with clinical narcissists. Dennis Rader, aka the BTK Killer, was diagnosed by a court-appointed psychiatrist as having narcissistic personality disorder due in part to his intense need for fame, his self-appointed nickname, and his conviction that he was smarter than the cops who pursued him.&lt;/p&gt;
      
    &lt;p&gt;And Ted Bundy has been described by psychologists and criminologists as having an extreme form of narcissism, as well, though the infamous serial murderer and rapist was evaluated prior to 1980, when narcissistic personality disorder became an official diagnosis. Even Bundy’s decision to represent himself in court reflected this towering self-regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all serial killers are alike, nor all narcissists—and the most dangerous minds might not be the ones overflowing with self-love.&lt;/p&gt;

The grandiose type, which combines a powerful need for admiration with a tendency toward aggression and dominance, is the one we most often hear about. But another, stealthier form of narcissism, known as the “vulnerable” subtype, has earned increasing recognition from psychologists in recent decades. Vulnerable narcissists are exquisitely sensitive to rejection, prone to social withdrawal, and plagued by feelings of inadequacy that can slide into resentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a team of scientists from Bamberg University in Germany and the University of Essex, Online in the United Kingdom has found that certain traits associated with vulnerable narcissism are far more common among sexually motivated serial killers than previously appreciated. The &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11896-025-09780-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, could help investigators understand the behaviors and motivations of such offenders, which could make it easier to identify them earlier, before they escalate to repeated killing.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most earlier studies of serial killers relied on individual case histories and rarely separated offenders into psychological subtypes. To build a more representative sample, the researchers behind the new study analyzed interrogations and confessions from 45 male, sexually motivated serial killers, drawn from publicly available records and private archives. They also focused more closely on specific narcissistic traits—such as admiration, rivalry, isolation, and enmity—than on narcissistic personality disorder as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were striking. By systematically analyzing audio recordings of the serial killers confessions and testimonies, they found that traits linked to vulnerable enmity, including defensiveness, paranoia, and outward aggression, appeared in 84 percent of the men. Grandiose admiration, the classic showy narcissism of self-promotion and enhancement, was displayed by 76 percent of the men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings point to a volatile combination: fragile self-worth tied to violent aggression. This is in line with other &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0306624X19838683" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; that has shown that many sexually motivated killers use violence to cope with feelings of social isolation, loneliness, and inadequacy.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone with these narcissistic traits will turn out to be a serial killer, of course. Many vulnerable and grandiose narcissists never engage in criminal behavior. But if investigators can identify a toxic pattern sooner, perhaps they may one day interrupt a killing spree before it takes off. &lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-13765" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enjoying  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://nautil.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nautilus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;?

          &lt;p&gt;A single sperm donor who carries a rare cancer-causing genetic mutation has fathered at least 197 children across 14 countries in Europe, according to &lt;a href="https://investigations.news-exchange.ebu.ch/donor-7069-tp53-mutation-exposes-sperm-banking-crisis/"&gt;a collaborative investigation by 14 European news groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to their investigative report, some of the children have already died, and many others are expected to develop deadly cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man—Donor 7069, alias “Kjeld”—carries a rare mutation in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/tp53/"&gt;TP53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; gene, which codes for a critical tumor suppressor called protein 53 or p53. This protein (which is a transcription factor) keeps cells from dividing uncontrollably, can activate DNA repair processes amid damage, and can trigger cell death when a cell is beyond repair. Many cancers are linked to mutations in p53.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a p53 mutation is passed down in sperm (a germline mutation), it causes a rare autosomal dominant condition called &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/li-fraumeni-syndrome/#causes"&gt;Li Fraumeni syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which greatly increases the risk of a variety of cancers in childhood and young adults. Those include cancers of the brain, blood, bone, soft tissue, adrenal glands, and breast, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimated frequency of this type of mutation is between 1 in 5,000 and 1 in 20,000 .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the investigation, the man was unaffected by the condition, but the mutation was present in around 20 percent of his sperm.&lt;/p&gt;

Within GeneBayes, we used gene features in a machine learning-based empirical Bayes framework to improve the accuracy of constraint estimates. Diverse gene features, such as gene expression patterns and protein structure embeddings, can enhance the accuracy of these estimates. GeneBayes is a highly adaptable framework, easily extendable to various applications, as outlined in the original article&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="Zeng, T., Spence, J.

We used the normalized matrix as a usage of each program in each cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cNMF, a meta-analysis of multiple iterations of NMF was performed to obtain a ‘consensus’ result. In cNMF, the number of programs (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;) is a key model hyperparameter to tune. To determine it, we tested different values of &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; (30, 60, 90 and 120) and decided to proceed with &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; = 60 based on the error versus stability comparison (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#Fig9"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt;), as proposed by the authors. In addition, we used density threshold = 0.5 to filter out the outlier programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec30"&gt;Annotation of programs to biological pathways&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the gene-by-program matrix produced by cNMF, we can obtain the non-negative loadings of each gene to the program. We ranked the genes based on the loadings and utilized the top-ranked genes for each program to characterize the biological pathways of the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annotating the programs to specific biological processes is a multifaceted task. In this study, for each program, we considered three orthogonal lines of evidence for annotating biological pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar1"&gt;Gene Ontology enrichment of top genes&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;We examined the enrichment of the top 200 genes in the Gene Ontology categories and MsigDB hallmark gene sets using the enrichGO and enricher functions in the clusterProfiler&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 90" title="Xu, S. et al.

To calculate the enrichment, we utilized genes expressed in K562 cells as a background set to avoid bias.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;We tested different thresholds for determining the top genes (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500). The Gene Ontology enrichment results were generally consistent, but we observed a trend: as the number of included genes increased, more categories were enriched in at least one program, with fewer categories specifically enriched for one program (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#MOESM1"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Capturing a wide range of biological categories, as well as annotating specific categories to the programs, is important for interpretation. Thus, we chose to use the top 200 genes for the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar2"&gt;Enrichment of transcription factor-binding sites&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;We can expect that for some programs, the genes within the same program are coordinately regulated by specific transcription factors. Such transcription factors can be used to characterize the programs. To this end, we utilized the ChIP–seq experiments of transcription factors in K562 from the ENCODE project. To convert the information on binding sites to a gene-level regulation score, we calculated the following score for each transcription factor (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;) for each protein-coding gene (&lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;), as adopted from ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 92" title="Ouyang, Z., Zhou, Q. &amp;amp; Wong, W.

The decay distance indicates the effective distance for the transcription factor and can vary depending on the transcription factors. Here we set the value to 1 kb, 5 kb, 10 kb, 50 kb, 100 kb, 500 kb or 1 Mb.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To determine which score was useful for the annotation of programs, we tested the correspondence of the score with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after knockdown of the same transcription factor. Specifically, for each transcription factor, we listed positive or negative DEGs after knockdown in Perturb-seq (FDR &amp;lt; 0.1) and we compared the ChIP–seq score (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;)) between DEGs and non-DEGs by Mann–Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;-test.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;As a natural consequence, we could annotate each transcription factor as an activator or inhibitor, according to the direction of effects after knockdown. We annotated a transcription factor as an activator if the downregulated DEGs after knockdown had significantly high ChIP scores (FDR &amp;lt; 0.05), and as an inhibitor if the upregulated DEGs after knockdown had significantly high ChIP scores (FDR &amp;lt; 0.05). As a result, ChIP scores for 167 transcription factors showed significant correspondence with their knockdown effects (FDR &amp;lt; 0.05) and were utilized for the annotation of programs. One best decay distance parameter was selected for each transcription factor based on the significance in the overlap with DEGs.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;For each program, we compared the top 300 loading genes with other expressed genes in K562 with respect to the 167 ChIP scores using the Mann–Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;-test. This test evaluates the enrichment of binding sites of the transcription factors to each program genes. Furthermore, we compared the program activity of the transcription factor-knockdown cells with others to see whether the transcription factor had a direct effect on the activity of the program (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#Fig9"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

This number of genes was determined to be roughly in the same range as the number of genes in the other gene sets.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;After completing these three tests for each program, we defined the curated annotation of each program as follows: initially, when the program corresponded to specific cell types, including cellular marker genes as top-loading genes, it was annotated as the cell type. For the others, we considered them as programs reflecting cellular pathways. We prioritized the most significantly enriched Gene Ontology or MsigDB pathways from the top 10 enriched pathways while avoiding ambiguous pathways for interpretation (such as the ‘RNA binding’ pathway). In cases in which multiple programs were enriched for the same category, we attempted to distinguish them by their enriched transcription factors or colocalization with marker gene expression. Finally, we curated one annotation per program while considering these factors (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#MOESM5"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

To obtain the effect size of each regulator on the program usage, we standardized the program usage to mean = 0 and s.d. = 1, and we compared perturbed cells with cells with non-targeting control gRNAs with a linear regression model, while accounting for GEM group (batch effect), number of expressed genes and percentage of mitochondrial gene expression as covariates. We utilized the point estimate of the effect size of perturbation on program usage as a regulatory effect of a gene &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(({\beta }_{x\to P})\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec32"&gt;Comparison of program regulations with genetic associations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec33"&gt;Definition of gene effects on traits and gene regulation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless specified, we utilized the posterior estimate of gene effect size on a trait with GeneBayes as the gene effect on a trait (&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;). For gene-level regulatory effects, we used the logFC of gene expression in perturbed cells compared with non-targeting cells as a point estimate of the perturbation effect on gene expression, as described above &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(({\beta }_{x\to y})\)&lt;/span&gt;. For program-level regulatory effects, we utilized the effect size of perturbation on program usage as a regulatory effect of a gene, as described above &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(({\beta }_{x\to P})\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec34"&gt;Correlation of gene regulatory effects with genetic associations&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started from a simple model in which the effect size of a peripheral gene &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; was determined by its regulatory effects on a limited set of core genes. In cases in which there was a single or a limited number of core genes &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;, the regulatory effect size of the peripheral gene on the core genes should correlate with the effect size of the peripheral gene on the trait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have previously observed a striking correlation between LoF burden test effect sizes and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;het&lt;/sub&gt; on average across traits&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 41" title="Spence J.

We excluded the effects of gene &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; itself, that is, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\beta }_{y\to y}\)&lt;/span&gt;, from the comparison because it does not reflect a trans-regulatory effect.

To avoid confounding, we divided the expressed genes in K562 into ten bins based on &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;het&lt;/sub&gt;. We then compared the average &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; of the top loading genes with a 10,000 randomly chosen sets of the same number of genes, while matching for the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;het&lt;/sub&gt; bin. To account for the directional association, we converted the rank of the observed value compared with the random distribution into two-sided &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values, while adding the sign of the average &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; to calculate the signed association &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the sign of program burden effects corresponds to the average effects of the LoF of program genes on the trait. Thus, positive program burden effects can be interpreted as a repressing association between program &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; and the trait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were generally not affected by the choice of the number of top genes (100, 200 and 300). However, for some programs including the haemoglobin synthesis program, where the association with MCH was concentrated on a small number of haemoglobin genes, the association was more pronounced with a smaller number of top genes. Therefore, for visualization of program burden effects and regulator–burden correlation (for example, Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;), we chose 100 for defining the top genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec36"&gt;Correlation of program regulatory effects with genetic associations&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we aimed to quantify the correlation of regulatory effects of genes on the program with &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;, which we call regulator–burden correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We calculated the correlation of regulatory effects with trait association signals while accounting for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;het&lt;/sub&gt; in the same way as the gene-level analysis:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ6" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\gamma }_{x} \sim {\beta }_{x\to P}+{S}_{\mathrm{het},x}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\beta }_{x\to P}\)&lt;/span&gt; corresponds to the regulatory effect of gene &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; on program &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For every program, we evaluated the significance of the coefficient for the first term. The significance level was multiplied by the sign of the coefficient for visualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the sign of &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\beta }_{x\to P}\)&lt;/span&gt; corresponds to the effect of the knockdown of gene &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; on the activity of program &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. The sign of &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the effect of the LoF of gene &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; on the phenotype. Thus, a positive regulator–burden correlation can be interpreted as a promoting association between program &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; and the trait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec37"&gt;Null distribution of burden effects&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For visualization of the distribution of burden effects of regulators or program genes (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#Fig10"&gt;5h&lt;/a&gt;), the expected distribution of burden effect sizes was determined by randomly picking up the same number of genes from non-associated genes 10,000 times and taking their average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;Estimation of causal relationships between programs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While examining the co-regulation patterns across programs, we noticed an asymmetric pattern of co-regulation between programs; that is, the regulators of program A also have effects on program B, but the regulators of program B do not have effects on program A (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#Fig10"&gt;5c&lt;/a&gt;). Such asymmetry can be explained by a causal directional association from one program to the other.

We selected SNPs with significant associations with MCH (&lt;i&gt;P &lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt; 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;) in the UKB, as well as variants with &lt;i&gt;P &lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt; 0.05 as control variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the program genes defined from cNMF in K562 (the top 100 loading genes for each program), we asked whether GWAS hits for MCH have concordant regulatory effects on the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, for each SNP, we derived the MCH-increasing allele based on &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; coefficients from GWAS summary statistics, polarized the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-eQTL Z scores of variants on program genes and calculated the average. We compared the values between GWAS significant variants and control variants using a two-sided Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec40"&gt;Validation of multiple program association with the trait&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether jointly modelling multiple programs can explain more of the genetic association signals than modelling with a single program, we conducted a cross-validation analysis. We randomly split 80% of the genes into a training set and 20% into a test set, and fitted regression models to explain the gene effects on the trait (&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;) by gene-regulatory effects on the program (or programs) using the training set. We evaluated the variance of &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; explained by the model using the test set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested this with the set of multiple programs chosen from the regulator–burden correlations in gene-to-program-to-trait models for MCH and RDW, as well as with the same number of randomly chosen programs, and single program models. The selected multiple program model explained much more variance than any single program model or random combination of programs for MCH and RDW (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#Fig11"&gt;6a–c&lt;/a&gt;). For IRF, only one program was chosen from the regulator–burden correlation in the gene-to-program-to-trait model, so we did not perform the comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec41"&gt;Construction of the gene-to-program-to-trait model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevalent co-regulation across programs, as well as feedback, suggested the need to jointly model multiple programs to identify those whose regulation independently explains the trait association signals. In addition, although program burden effects and regulator–burden correlation sometimes converge on the same program, we have observed cases where either only program content or only regulators are enriched in trait association signals, as well as cases in which both program content and regulators are enriched but through different mechanisms. Therefore, we treated program burden effects and regulator–burden correlation separately to identify trait-associated programs included in the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec42"&gt;Step 1: selection of programs based on regulator–burden correlations&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To select programs whose regulators are enriched for the trait association signals, we conducted a stepwise linear regression analysis using the ‘regsubsets’ function in the ‘leaps’ package&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 97" title="Thomas, L. based on Fortran code by Miller, A. leaps: regression subset selection.

Specifically, for MCH, we changed the number of explanatory variables from 1 to 6, and for each number of explanatory variables, we performed an exhaustive search for the combination of programs that explained the most variance of &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of variables to include in the final model was decided by assessing the variance explained in the model upon changing the number of variables (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#MOESM1"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt;), along with the significance of the model fit in the subsequent permutation test (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#MOESM1"&gt;2b&lt;/a&gt;). For the MCH model, we opted to include three variables together with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;het&lt;/sub&gt;: regulators for autophagy, haemoglobin synthesis and G2/M phase cell-cycle programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec43"&gt;Step 2: selection of programs based on program burden effects&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For selecting programs with enriched contents for the trait association signals, we followed the following process. First, for each program, we calculated the program burden effects. That is, we ranked the genes based on their loading and selected the top 200 genes and calculated the average of &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; of these genes. This number was determined by the following test for the model fit. Then, we compared it with randomly selected 10,000 sets of genes expressed in K562 while matching for 10 bins of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;het&lt;/sub&gt; to calculate two-sided enrichment &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. Subsequently, we ranked the programs based on these &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. To determine the number of programs to include in the final model, we varied the number of top programs included and evaluated the model fit in the subsequent permutation test (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#MOESM1"&gt;2b&lt;/a&gt;). Specifically, for the MCH model, five programs were selected: the haemoglobin synthesis program and four programs associated with different phases of cell cycle. These five programs largely corresponded to those that had significant program burden effects after Bonferroni correction in the previous test (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#Fig4"&gt;4c&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec44"&gt;Step 3: predicting the signs of associations for the regulators and program genes in the model&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;After selecting programs from both regulator and program content associations with the trait, we assigned the predicted signs of effects to each gene in the model. Specifically, for regulators, we considered genes that exhibited significant regulatory effects on the selected programs (FDR &amp;lt; 0.05). In cases in which a regulator had regulatory effects on multiple programs, we calculated the total effects of a gene on the model by summing the product of the effect sizes of the selected programs on the trait in the multiple linear regression model (&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) and the gene effects on the program (&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\beta }_{x\to P}\)&lt;/span&gt;; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#Fig11"&gt;6d&lt;/a&gt;). The sign of this product was utilized as the regulatory direction of the gene to the trait predicted from the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For program contents, we assigned the sign of the association of the program (that is, the sign of the average &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; of the top loading genes) to the top 200 loading genes. If a gene belongs to both program and regulator genes, although a such case was relatively rare, we assigned the sign from the program enrichment test because of the potentially larger effect sizes of program function on the trait (&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Note&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec45"&gt;Step 4: assessing the directional concordance of the associations of top hits with the model&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess how well the predicted model can explain the directional genetic associations, we evaluated it in two ways: leave-one-out cross-validation and permutation testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For leave-one-out cross-validation, we left out one gene at a time, selected the programs based on program burden effects and regulator–burden correlation using the other genes, and predicted the sign of the left-out gene as described above. We then assessed the enrichment of correctly predicted genes among the top hits (genes with |&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;| &amp;gt; 0.1), compared with genes with minimal associations (genes with |&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), using Fisher’s exact test. In this test, the enrichment is influenced by both (1) the enrichment of the top genes among the genes selected in the model (significant regulators or program genes in the model), and (2) the accuracy of the predicted signs among the genes in the model. Our result for the MCH model showed that the top genes were enriched in both (1) selected genes in the model (OR = 1.8), and (2) sign concordance (OR = 1.9), with an overall enrichment of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; and OR = 2.2. This result supported the use of Perturb-seq for predicting the directed gene associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the permutation test, we created 20,000 sets of permuted &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; by permuting gene labels. We then followed the same program selection and sign assignments processes, while fixing the number of selected programs from both the program burden effects and the regulator–burden correlation. In each permutation, we counted the number of top genes whose sign of association was correctly predicted by the model and evaluated the enrichment over other genes using Fisher’s exact test. Finally, we compared the Fisher’s test &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value of the observed data to those of the permuted sets and calculated the permutation &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#Fig13"&gt;8b,d,f&lt;/a&gt;). Similar to leave- one-out cross-validation, we observed that the observed genetic association data had many more concordant genes, along with a higher ratio of concordant to discordant predicted signs than the permuted data (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#Fig13"&gt;8a,c,e&lt;/a&gt;). The permutation test can evaluate the fit of our model to the genetic association signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the permuted dataset, we slightly modified the way for program selection. Here, instead of matching for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;het&lt;/sub&gt;, we compared the distribution of &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; between the top loading genes and randomly selected genes expressed in K562 using the Mann–Whitney &lt;i&gt;U-&lt;/i&gt;test to calculate enrichment &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. Subsequently, we ranked the programs based on these &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and selected the same number of top programs. This helps to greatly speed up the process, although the resulting permutation &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value for the model is potentially conservative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ran the permutation tests while differing the parameters for the modelling. The model fit to the data was robust to the choice of the number for defining program genes (100, 200 or 300) and to different thresholds for defining high-effect genes (|&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;|; Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#MOESM1"&gt;2c&lt;/a&gt;). Although the enrichment was not very sensitive to the number of top genes, 200 genes resulted in slightly more stable enrichment across a range of &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; thresholds. On the basis of these results, we chose to use the top 200 genes for creating the gene-to-program-to-trait map. In addition, we chose the threshold for |&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;| to be 0.1 based on the fit of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec46"&gt;Step 5: drawing the gene-to-program-to-trait map&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we aimed to draw a map to interpret the functions of the trait-associated genes. Here we included all the top hits with |&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;| &amp;gt; 0.1 whose direction of association was concordant with that predicted from the model into the map (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#Fig5"&gt;5a&lt;/a&gt;). When regulators have concordant regulatory effects on multiple programs, we included all paths in the map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec47"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09866-3#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 16:54:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE43UTFOdV9iaUJiY1A3NHpJNnI2bndPUjJLOHhxU2JOYTVUSDFlT2xJWmZ5OTlHRTNkVXQyclVQN1Y5SjZSX0RFdkdKOFpiYnIzaGdENG5KUU5CZ1RiUXpz</guid></item><item><title>计算机化预防计划可以将创伤后应激障碍降低到前战斗部队的1 ％ -以色列时报</title><link>https://www.timesofisrael.com/computerized-prevention-program-could-lower-ptsd-to-1-of-former-combat-troops/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="the-content"&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;A new study has found that a series of specialized computer-based training exercises can significantly reduce the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among IDF combat soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peer-reviewed study by Tel Aviv University (TAU), the IDF Medical Corps, and the US Department of Defense is one of the first PTSD prevention programs in the world that was tested and replicated in randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was developed by Prof. Yair Bar-Haim, professor of psychology and neuroscience at TAU and director of the National Center for Traumatic Stress and Resilience, and doctoral student Chelsea Gober Dykan.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;It found that out of more than 500 soldiers, just one percent of those who participated in the attention-training program developed PTSD, compared to 5.3% in the control group — an almost fivefold reduction in risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a simple program that shifts a soldier’s attention towards the threat on the screen,” Bar-Haim told The Times of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Computerized prevention program could lower PTSD to 1% of former combat troops"&gt;

	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;The research comes as the Defense Ministry’s Rehabilitation Department &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/over-half-of-soldiers-treated-in-rehab-centers-have-mental-health-issues-stats-show/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on Monday that it has treated some 22,000 wounded soldiers since October 7, 2023, of whom some 58% are suffering from PTSD and other mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bar-Haim said he believes the program works because “attention to threat is a basic mechanism in human survival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, people “who do not pay enough attention to threats are at risk for PTSD during deployment and after deployment,” he said. “When trauma hits them, they probably do not have enough attentional resources allocated to process the trauma.”&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;The training program was adopted by the IDF in 2018, but it was ended shortly before the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results recently appeared in the top-tier &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.20250160"&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Threat-related attentional bias&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research began with very large-scale studies on PTSD that Bar-Haim conducted in the IDF 17 years ago with more than 1,000 soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PTSD is a mental health condition that might develop after soldiers experience terrifying attacks, explosions, or see others injured or killed. Although they’re no longer on the battlefield, they might have flashbacks, nightmares, and a constant feeling of threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to measure those who ended up developing PTSD,” Bar-Haim said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One factor that increases PTSD is what’s known as threat-related attentional bias, when soldiers continue scanning for danger and perceiving threats even after the danger has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the scientists designed what Bar-Haim called a “computer intervention” to shift soldiers’ attention toward the danger to get them accustomed to threats. He said the intervention “manifests in the brain, in the neural systems.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;a href="https://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/ybh/files/2023/04/Waldetal2016PsychologicalMedicine.pdf"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, led by postdoctoral fellow Ilan Wald, was conducted in 2012 and tested the computer-based training program among some 800 soldiers in one of the IDF’s infantry brigades during their basic training and through their first deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The training is very simple, delivered on laptops and computers and takes about seven minutes per session,” Bar-Haim explained. “You need to only do it four times over separate days.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3709178" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/DUAL-5.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3709178" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/DUAL-5-640x400.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Left: a screenshot of Prof. Yair Bar-Haim’s PTSD prevention program. Right: a soldier participates in the study. (Courtesy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first study, soldiers were shown both neutral and threatening pairs of words. In the second study, they were shown neutral and threatening faces. In both studies, targets then appeared near the images with arrows pointing to the left or right. The soldiers had to respond by pressing the relevant key on a keyboard as quickly as possible without compromising accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 160 repetitions per training. “It was a kind of game,” Bar-Haim said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process gradually trained the soldiers to direct more attention toward potential threats in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly thereafter, in the summer of 2014, most of the soldiers saw combat during Israel’s Operation Protective Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four months after the fighting ended in August 2014, Bar-Haim and his team found that among those who participated in the training program, just 2.6% had PTSD compared to 7.8% of the soldiers who had not had the training, considerably reducing the risk for PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even though these results were promising, I was not completely convinced that it was not just by chance,” Bar-Haim said. “I felt that it needed a good replication with better control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bar-Haim, along with Dykan and their research team, slightly modified the study and conducted it in 2022–2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the soldiers, one-third received the original protocol, one-third underwent a revised protocol, and the remaining third, the control group, received placebo training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We tried the original version of the intervention and a new version that we were hoping would be better,” Bar-Haim said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that 2.7% of the group that received the revised attention-training protocol had PTSD compared to 5.3% in the control group. Notably, less than 1% of troops who were given the original version this time around developed PTSD symptoms by around the 18-month mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The original version is really the best one,” Bar-Haim said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Defense Ministry forecasted that by the end of 2026, its rehab centers will take in another 10,000 wounded veterans, most of whom will be suffering from PTSD or other mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;The rehab department’s budget stands at NIS 8.3 billion ($2.57 billion), of which NIS 4.1 billion ($1.27 billion) is dedicated to treating those with mental health conditions, the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a reply to The Times of Israel, Dr. Dennis S. Charney, dean emeritus of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who has done extensive research on PTSD and was not involved in the study, wrote that Bar-Haim’s research “demonstrates that attention bias modification can have robust preventative effects in reducing the effects of combat on the development of PTSD.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are no universally accepted methods to completely prevent PTSD, Charney said that Bar-Haim’s “practical method” can be integrated into a comprehensive resilience-building program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An IDF spokesperson told The Times of Israel that over the past two years, the field of mental health in the military has “expanded following the widening of existing frameworks and the opening of significant new frameworks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IDF established a mental resilience branch in March 2024, where “tools are developed and implemented to strengthen the resilience of service members,” the spokesperson said. At this time, however, Bar-Haim’s program is not included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are very clear results now about the efficacy of this program,” Bar-Haim said. “The  IDF implemented it in the past, and they should implement it again.”&lt;/p&gt;
