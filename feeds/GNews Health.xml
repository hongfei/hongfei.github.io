When we’re stressed and overwhelmed, we tend to gather clutter and misplace things. When we’re disconnected from people and purpose, communication diminishes, mail accumulates, and emails go unread. As &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/enlightened-living/200807/how-the-environment-we-create-is-a-reflection-of-our-state-of-mind" target="_blank"&gt;psychotherapist Michael J. Formica&lt;/a&gt; explains, a person’s home reflects their “global state of mind” — a mix of emotional, social, spiritual, and physical well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When seemingly superficial things like clutter and messes seem to run rampant at home, they can also be a sign of something deeper and more personal. If you notice these things at someone’s house, they’re struggling more than they admit. Even if some of these things are normal in the home of a well-functioning and happy person, they can also be connected to chronic stress, unhappiness, and general disarray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you notice these 11 things at someone’s house, they’re struggling more than they admit:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. A bed that's never made&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/if-you-notice-these-things-at-someones-house-struggling-more-than-they-admit-unmade-bed.png" alt="Woman sitting in her consistently unmade bed at home." title="consistently unmade bed if you notice these things at someone's house they're struggling more than they admit" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;yourphotopie | Shutterstock.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/its-not-just-in-your-head/202505/how-making-your-bed-can-improve-your-mood" target="_blank"&gt;Psychiatrist Susan Trachman&lt;/a&gt; states that making your bed not only promotes well-being and health through routine but also can boost your mood, productivity, and stress levels. If you make your bed in the morning and everything else in your day goes “wrong,” at least you have a comfortable, made bed to come home to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you usually see an unmade bed at someone else’s house, they might be struggling more than they let on — neglecting the simplest way to protect their mood and sanity just for a few more minutes of sleep or rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/small-things-you-can-do-morning-so-you-dont-want-get-back-bed-and-hide"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Small Things You Can Do In The Morning So You Don't Want To Get Back In Bed And Hide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

Self-neglect, like &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-025-22609-3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;another study from the BMC Public Health journal&lt;/a&gt;, is connected with symptoms of depression and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, even if things like personal hygiene and doing chores seem simple, neglecting them can cause mental health issues and be a side effect of not doing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/phrases-improved-mental-health"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 Phrases That Actually Improved My Mental Health When I Was At My Lowest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.

Especially if their lack of lawn care prevents them from &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5663018/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;enjoying their green or outdoor spaces&lt;/a&gt;, it could negatively impact their overall mood and well-being at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/low-energy-hobbies-still-get-you-outside-once-awhile"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Low-Energy Hobbies That Still Get You Outside Once In A While&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.

Many people are skipping meals, struggling with food and grocery budgets, and not eating enough to stay physically nourished because they lack the money to afford more wholesome and plentiful options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person’s financial situation is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9362113/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;closely linked to their food security, mental health, and physical well-being.&lt;/a&gt; So, if you notice these signs at someone’s house, they’re likely struggling more than they admit — even if their money issues and financial turmoil are kept quiet in other parts of their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/money/people-who-secretly-struggle-financially-usually-have-these-things-missing-from-homes"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Who Secretly Struggle Financially Usually Have These 11 Things Missing From Their Homes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

When they constantly &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryenglish/2021/03/09/the-hidden-costs-when-remote-workers-spend-all-day-on-the-couch/" target="_blank"&gt;work from their bed or couch&lt;/a&gt;, their work begins to intrude into parts of their home meant for other activities — whether socializing, relaxing, or resting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if having intentional space seems subtle, working from a place like your bed tricks the brain into thinking it’s time to be productive and alert, even if you’re winding down for the night in your bedroom. The stress and anxiety of work aren’t confined to an intentional space but are instead running rampant in these people’s homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-youre-burned-out-not-lazy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Signs You're Burned Out, Not Lazy — According To Psychology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6.

That picture is mostly right, but it may be missing a a key component. According to &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1096050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;, common mouth bacteria that usually stay in their lane may drift into the bloodstream and trigger heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that mouth microbes don’t just float through the bloodstream and disappear, as has always been understood to be the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may take up residence inside &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;arterial plaque&lt;/a&gt; and help spark the kind of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lifestyle-choices-in-young-adulthood-impact-cognitive-ability-in-midlife/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that makes a weak spot crack. That is the sort of crack that can set off a clot and cut off blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bacteria-and-heart-artery-plaques"&gt;Bacteria and heart artery plaques&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaques form inside blood vessels over time. They are made of fats, cholesterol, immune cells, and scar-like tissue. Many sit there without causing trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk rises when the thin outer layer – the fibrous cap – breaks. Once that cover fails, the plaque’s contents meet the bloodstream; &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/red-blood-cells-found-to-squeeze-clots-tight-using-physical-force/"&gt;a clot can form&lt;/a&gt;, and a heart attack can follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study focused on whether bacteria from the mouth, especially a group called &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/viridans-streptococci" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;viridans streptococci&lt;/a&gt;, could be tucked into those plaques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central question was: were bacteria hiding out and then helping to drive inflammation right where it hurts most?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed artery plaques from two sources: people who died suddenly and patients having surgery to clear clogged neck arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did not rely on one test. They used DNA methods to detect bacterial genetic traces, special stains to locate bacteria in tissue, and gene activity analyses to see which immune pathways were active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also tested how different bacterial components trigger early warning signals in immune cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pattern recognition receptors – the body’s “burglar alarms” – were a key focus, including a pathway called &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/tlr2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TLR2&lt;/a&gt; that is well known for spotting bacterial signatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-biofilm-bacteria-and-the-heart"&gt;Biofilm bacteria and the heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the deeper parts of many plaques, the team found signs that viridans streptococci were living together as a biofilm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A biofilm is a community of bacteria embedded in a protective matrix that helps them stick to a surface and shield themselves from stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those plaque cores, immune cells called &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-failure-creates-a-lasting-stress-memory-in-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;macrophages&lt;/a&gt; did not appear to react to the biofilm. In other words, the bacteria appeared tucked away where the body’s defenses were not mounting a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-bacteria-break-bad"&gt;When bacteria break bad&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The picture changed at the edges of plaques that were cracked or appeared unstable. There, the researchers saw scattered bacteria that appeared to have broken free from the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/biofilms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hidden biofilm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift coincided with activation of immune alarms. Pattern recognition receptors lit up – especially through TLR2 – a classic “we found bacteria” signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alarm did not just activate the rapid innate immune response; it also drew in the slower, more targeted adaptive immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bacterial involvement in coronary artery disease has long been suspected, but direct and convincing evidence has been lacking,” explained &lt;a href="https://researchportal.tuni.fi/en/persons/pekka-karhunen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Pekka Karhunen&lt;/a&gt;, lead author of this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrated the presence of genetic material – DNA – from several oral bacteria inside atherosclerotic plaques.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-disease-and-bacteria-signals"&gt;Heart disease and bacteria signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples that tested positive for viridans streptococci tended to come from plaques that were more advanced and complicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the autopsy series, bacterial signals lined up with deaths due to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-kills-differently-now-than-five-decades-ago/"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That association does not prove the bacteria caused the deaths, but it strengthens the idea that they may play a role in a dangerous chain of events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daily-life-implications"&gt;Daily life implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brushing-your-teeth-regularly-can-prevent-deadly-liver-disease/"&gt;Oral health&lt;/a&gt; has long been linked with heart health in population studies. Everyday activities like brushing or chewing can push mouth bacteria into the bloodstream, especially when gums are inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings point to a path where certain mouth bacteria might colonize plaques, lie low in biofilms, and then shed pieces that trigger inflammation right where the plaque is fragile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a call for antibiotics to prevent heart attacks. It does not turn brushing into a magic shield against heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol levels, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, diabetes, and family history still carry a lot of weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests bacteria – especially in biofilm form – may be another player that nudges risky plaques toward rupture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-questions-need-answers"&gt;More questions need answers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, this surprising, peer-reviewed study links oral bacteria within arterial plaques to inflammation associated with plaque rupture, highlighting a plausible mouth-heart connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps include testing whether targeting biofilms, improving oral health, or dialing down specific immune alarms could make plaques more stable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will also need to sort out cause versus correlation and identify which bacterial features matter most inside human arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-you-should-do"&gt;What you should do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, continue to follow the basic guidelines urged by the American Heart Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eggs-and-cholesterol-a-new-twist-in-an-old-debate/"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; in check. Do not smoke or vape. Move your body most days. Sleep well. Eat in a way that supports cardiovascular health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep up with dental basics also – regular brushing, flossing, and routine checkups reduce the chances that mouth bacteria slip into your blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these habits are cure-alls on their own, but together they lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.125.041521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 02:26:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQU3VwRlNzakVNQTRudmhLXy0yMDlyN1lJSllkMHVZWEhPYTliYlhtdzVhQXRRR0J1cXVqaDZlWE1MX1Niai1xOFlPWDBQY0dXNVNTSUdmMTg0elZJaF8tT0lXM2RJa25WbE5tbzM2bkNid29QMnJmQzZqbk5MUE1DbUk5b0owZHhYdVhZX2Nvd19VMWRFSFluQ3dJdVNzbGhmQndPZmROTGVNVW5zQUIzdHRkVQ</guid></item><item><title>20岁的锻炼……每周只需16分钟--《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15039727/workout-two-decades-life-heart-health-cardio.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A simple workout routine performed once a week could help reverse your heart health by two decades, a leading cardiologist has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Benjamin Levine, a professor of internal medicine and cardiology at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-774899d0-837e-11f0-a78a-a5e05d4aa3d1"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; Southwestern Medical Center, is a big advocate of the 'Norwegian 4x4'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This high-intensity workout, which he says is practiced by the Norwegian ski team, involves pushing yourself to 90 to 95 percent of your maximum heart rate for four, four-minute intervals once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the suggested activities include running, biking ,and rowing, pushing yourself to your limit for the allotted time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the four minutes are up, you then take&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://utswmed.org/medblog/heart-cardio-workouts/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;three minutes of recovery time before doing another four-minute set. This pattern should be repeated four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doing just one routine of the Norwegian 4x4 per week will reap big rewards for your heart health, Dr Levine says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To prove how advantageous the Norwegian 4x4 can be, Dr Levine recruited 53 participants with an average age of 53, and he assigned them a fitness plan for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only vigorous part of the plan was the Norwegian 4x4, which the participants were told to perform once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A simple workout routine performed once a week could help reverse your heart health by two decades, a leading cardiologist has revealed (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other elements of their program included one hour of doing a 'fun' physical activity per week, such as dancing or playing a sport, one 30-minute session of strength training,  and two to three days of moderate-intensity exercise for at least 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the two-year period, the middle-aged participants, who were previously sedentary, saw a dramatic improvement in their heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine used a heart catheterization (a diagnostic procedure a healthcare provider uses to see how well your heart is working) to measure the flexibility or 'youthfulness' of their hearts and found, after the study, their hearts were comparable to someone in their 30s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the heart ages, the main artery (aorta) becomes thicker, stiffer, and less flexible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is related to changes in the connective tissue of the blood vessel wall. This makes the blood pressure higher and makes the heart work harder, which may lead to thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://utswmed.org/medblog/heart-cardio-workouts/"&gt;said the results&lt;/a&gt; of his study were 'quite compelling, and showed that it is possible to reverse some of the consequences of a sedentary lifestyle if you commit to a heart-healthy exercise routine in late middle age (40 to 64 years).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He carried out a follow-up study involving patients in the same age range who had 'thickened' aortas that made them high risk for heart disease or heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that they were given the same exercise treatment plan for one year, and they showed a similar improvement in the elasticity, or 'youthfulness,' of their heart muscle as the research team saw in healthy middle-aged individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The heart expert concluded: 'This study shows that dedicated exercise training in middle age can reverse some of the consequences of diseases such as hypertension, and can potentially stave off more serious diseases such as heart failure in the future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart disease continues to kill more people in the US than any other cause, according to the American Heart Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022 (the most recent year for which final data is available), there were nearly 1million deaths from coronary artery disease, heart attack, and stroke - collectively referred to as cardiovascular disease - the equivalent of a death every 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer, meanwhile, kills roughly 600,000 Americans per year, while dementia is responsible for 288,000 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from the American Heart Association say a lack of awareness compared to other diseases like cancer and an increase in risk factors may be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Data shows that heart attack cases are on the rise in young Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Levine suggests that 'exercise should be a prescription for life'. He says: 'The benefits of a healthy heart for longevity and quality of life are too great to ignore' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, heart disease can be a silent killer, lurking for decades before symptoms start to appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts also warn that while deaths from heart disease may be starting to plateau for the first time since the pandemic, risk factors for the disease are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly half of US adults have high blood pressure, for example, and almost three-quarters are overweight or obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts reveal that if trends continue, two-thirds of US adults will become obese and suffer high blood pressure by 2050, further increasing their risk of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise can reduce the risk of heart and circulatory diseases by up to 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults should get 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity, or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine suggests that 'exercise should be a prescription for life'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds: 'The benefits of a healthy heart for longevity and quality of life are too great to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A regular exercise routine will help you keep your heart healthy for years to come. Jog, swim, golf, hike, play basketball, dance, do yoga - whatever you love to do. The most important thing is to get out there and do it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS — &lt;span&gt;Two people have died after eating Louisiana oysters infected with the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wbrz.com/news/how-to-protect-yourself-from-vibrio-vulnificus-the-bacteria-found-in-some-coastal-waters" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wbrz.com/news/how-to-protect-yourself-from-vibrio-vulnificus-the-bacteria-found-in-some-coastal-waters&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1756427330539000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3OwuXwXyGrlhFrf80ckg-Z" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;flesh-eating bacteria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Vibrio vulnificus, officials confirmed to WBRZ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A state health official said that the two deaths happened after people ate oysters harvested in Louisiana at two separate restaurants — one in Louisiana and another in Florida. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jennifer Armentor, molluscan shellfish program administrator from the Louisiana Department of Health, added that 14 more people have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;been infected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, 34 people have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;been infected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and six people have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wbrz.com/news/wednesday-s-health-report-20-louisianians-infected-with-flesh-eating-bacteria-in-2025-up-from-past/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wbrz.com/news/wednesday-s-health-report-20-louisianians-infected-with-flesh-eating-bacteria-in-2025-up-from-past/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1756427330539000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2i5x39Du_6Od_uOxM2hMJ9" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;died in 2025 alone,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a higher rate than any previous year over the last decade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s just prolific right now,” Armentor told the Louisiana Oyster Task Force on Tuesday at the New Orleans Lakefront Airport.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WBRZ spoke with Jones Creek Cafe &amp;amp; Oyster Bar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;CEO George Shaheen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; about this news and how seafood spots ensure that their oysters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;stay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; tasty and safe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaheen has been at the head of his business for nearly 40 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Well, over the years, we haven't had as much of that as you would actually think because the way that the Wildlife and Fisheries and the Department of Health have created a bond between the fishermen who are out there fishing and how things need to be done and handled," Shaheen said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaheen told WBRZ that he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;gets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; his oysters from Delacroix Island, where he used to fish, and has complete trust in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;those&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; who harvest the oysters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"You have to go out, and when you go on a boat and you're an oyster fisherman out there, you can stay out there, I think it's 72 hours if you have a way to cool the oysters when they come in," Shaheen said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaheen showed WBRZ some tickets that are put onto oyster sacks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The tickets &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; information such as where the oysters were harvested and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; they were harvested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It basically is really the key to being able to, if something happens somewhere, they know right where to go. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;By&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Department of Health, we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;have&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to keep these for 90 days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; We get checked every 120 days," Shaheen said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He says that modern growing and harvesting techniques make for better oysters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Now, they use limestone out in the marsh to basically grow the oysters on, and they're much cleaner. The difference between you getting them out of the marsh mud and being on a Limestone is that they're much cleaner," Shaheen said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Restaurants in Louisiana are required by law to display visible signs or messages about the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;risk of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; eating raw seafood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Yes, cause you never know what's in the ocean and what gets inside these oysters, so if they're not cooked, you can easily get bacteria, so you have to put a warning out for people," Jones Creek bartender Amanda Steele said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Customers WBRZ spoke with at Jones Creek share the same trust that the restaurant does.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I eat them (oysters) both ways (cooked and raw) and eat them in the raw state in the wintertime. I trust my local oyster bars," Customer Larry Campagna said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and though there were years of progress in reducing its impact, in recent years, strokes have become more and more common.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Insulin resistance, a condition where the body becomes less sensitive to insulin, plays a key role in stroke recurrence and poor recovery, often linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With rising global obesity rates, conditions like insulin resistance and related stroke risks are becoming more common.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Measures like the triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, which indicates insulin resistance, and the weight-adjusted waist index (WWI), which evaluates fat distribution, have been shown to predict stroke risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A new combined measure, the TyG-WWI index, has recently been linked to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11698358" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher risk of stroke&lt;/a&gt; in people with prediabetes, but its role in the general population is still unclear. Understanding how these markers work together could help improve &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-9am-to-reduce-your-stroke-risk-11745518" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;stroke prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To bridge this knowledge gap, researchers explored whether the TyG-WWI index health measure is linked to stroke risk in the general population. The goal was to find better ways to assess stroke risk, improve healthcare management and develop timely strategies to help people who are at high risk of having a stroke, and these results were published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) is a large U.S. health study that collects data to monitor the nation’s health and nutrition. It uses a special sampling method to ensure the results represent the entire population. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this study, researchers analyzed NHANES data from 1999 to 2018, focusing on adults, resulting in 22,615 adults in the analysis. The main focus was on the health measure the TyG-WWI index, which combines triglyceride levels, blood sugar, body weight and waist size to assess health risks. Blood samples and body measurements were taken by trained professionals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Factors like age, sex, ethnicity, education, income and health conditions (such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease) were also considered to better understand stroke risk. The data was then analyzed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study looked at how TyG-WWI values—which reflect both the triglyceride glucose index and the weight-adjusted waist index—are linked to stroke risk. Researchers found that as TyG-WWI values increased, so did the risk of stroke. Initially, without considering any other factors, a rise in TyG-WWI values was linked to a 65% higher stroke risk. After accounting for age and sex, the increased risk dropped to 24%, and when all other factors were considered, it was 15%. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To make it easier to compare, participants were divided into four groups based on their TyG-WWI values. Compared to the group with the lowest scores, the other groups had higher stroke risks: 37% higher in the group with the second lowest values, and 38% higher in the group with the very highest values. This finding indicates that higher TyG-WWI values were consistently linked to a greater risk of stroke.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers also found a clear, linear relationship: as TyG-WWI values increased, so did stroke risk. This pattern was especially strong in younger participants and those without coronary heart disease. Other factors like sex, ethnicity, education and smoking or drinking habits didn’t significantly change this relationship.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has a few limitations to consider before applying the findings to the general population. First, because it was based on data collected at a single point in time, it is not possible to determine whether higher TyG-WWI values directly cause an increased risk of stroke. To establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship, future studies that follow participants over time are needed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Second, while we accounted for many factors that could influence the results, it’s possible that unknown factors still played a role, which the researchers couldn’t fully control for. Lastly, since this research focused on data from the U.S. population, it’s uncertain whether the findings apply to people in other countries. More studies are needed to confirm whether these results are consistent across different populations and settings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The connection between the TyG-WWI index and stroke risk has real-world implications that could change how we approach stroke prevention. Think of the TyG-WWI index as a health "check engine" light; it combines key factors like blood sugar, triglycerides, body weight and waist size to give a snapshot of your metabolic health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For health care providers, this could become a powerful tool to spot people at higher risk of stroke early, even before any warning signs appear. For the rest of us, it’s a wake-up call to pay attention to things like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight management, blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; and fat distribution. With obesity and metabolic concerns on the rise, this kind of early detection could make a significant difference in preventing strokes and improving recovery outcomes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re concerned about your own blood sugar or cholesterol levels, checking in with a healthcare professional can be a good first step. You can also try to shake up your routine to incorporate more exercise and more healthy meals. We love using short, adaptable meal plans—like our weeklong &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-no-sugar-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-insulin-resistance-11759777" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;No-Sugar High-Fiber Meal Plan for Insulin Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and our seven-day &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-high-fiber-no-sugar-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-11775446" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;High-Fiber, No-Sugar Meal Plan for Weight Loss&lt;/a&gt;—as a simple and delicious way to reset your routine and discover new recipes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases&lt;/em&gt; sheds light on the important role the TyG-WWI index could play in understanding and managing stroke risk. By combining key health markers like blood sugar, triglycerides, body weight and waist size, this index offers a practical way to assess metabolic health and identify individuals who may be at higher risk of stroke. While more research is needed to confirm these findings across different populations and to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship, the results are a step forward in improving how we approach stroke prevention.

The vaccines from Moderna are approved for children as young as 6 months, Pfizer for ages 5 years and up, and Novavax for those 12 years and older — but only for patients considered to be at higher risk.

&lt;p&gt;Between work, errands, family obligations and household chores, life is busy. Taking time for yourself may not be feasible right now and that’s OK. If you can’t fit in the recommended 21 minutes of walking a day, start small. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even a quick one-minute jaunt pays off,” according to the report by Harvard Health. The report noted that a 2014 study from the University of Utah found that “for every minute of brisk walking that women did throughout the day, they lowered their risk of obesity by 5%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So start small. Task yourself with a minute-long walk down your driveway this afternoon, or take that 10-minute work check-in call as you walk around your block. No amount of time is too short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you feel ready, you can start to incorporate different walking distances and intensities, like speed changes and hills, Singh said. Both of these things, plus “maintaining a consistent habit will likely yield the biggest bang for its buck,” she explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/preventing-heart-disease-walking_l_62def5bae4b03dbb991be966" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7930552"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is common in Americans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers found certain nutrients may help reduce EDS by improving sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These nutrients include omega-6 fatty acids, found in nuts, seeds and fatty fish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Americans have a sleep problem. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an average of 40% of adults get &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep-11746534" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insufficient sleep&lt;/a&gt;, which includes both quality and quantity of sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This can result in health issues, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It also affects mental and emotional health, immunity and metabolism. And if you’re not getting enough sleep, you’re also likely to have excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because sleep issues are so pervasive, researchers from the U.S. and Finland joined forces to consider what might be behind 33% of U.S. adults having excessive daytime sleepiness. Specifically, they took a close look at metabolites, tiny molecules that are produced during metabolism, to see if there is any connection between them and sleep. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet’s eBioMedicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study was done in several parts with different analyses. For the first part, researchers drew data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). This was followed by replication analyses of three other studies: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), UK Biobank and Health2000 studies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Replication analyses are performed to try and replicate previously conducted studies and their results. The purpose of doing so is to test the strength of the findings and verify and confirm the results. This helps to ensure the reliability and consistency of the findings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There were over 6,000 participants for the HCHS/SOL study with a Hispanic/Latino background who had the information the researchers were looking for, which included the results of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire. The ESS includes eight questions regarding the likelihood of dozing off during the day in various scenarios. Responses to each question are on a scale of 0 to 3, with the highest possible score of 24 and higher scores relating to higher sleepiness. A score of 11 and above are considered EDS. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The other data researchers looked at were participants’ bloodwork, which included metabolomic measurements of the metabolites associated with sleep. Participants had filled out demographic and health information, including sleep duration, insomnia symptoms and diagnosis of sleep apnea. Participants had also reported dietary information, which was graded against the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; About 15% of the participants in the HCHS/SOL study were considered to have EDS; 58% of them were women. There was information on a total of 877 metabolites for each participant, which allowed researchers to analyze metabolite levels and how they might relate to sleep. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Higher ESS scores were associated with lower metabolite levels for seven metabolites across genders, plus an additional four in men. Among the seven metabolites were two long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Polyunsaturated fatty acids are found in foods like fatty fish, nuts and seeds, as well as seed oils, like canola and peanut oils. People with higher levels of PUFAs had less excessive daytime sleepiness. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers note that these foods—fish, nuts and seeds—are popular in the Mediterranean diet. The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-and-worst-diets-2025-8767671" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; has consistently ranked at the top of all the diets for years. This is because it prioritizes nutrient-dense foods, including fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and fish. And it’s been linked with numerous health benefits, including a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-brain-age-study-8745764" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthier brain&lt;/a&gt; and heart, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-arthritis-study-11740419" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;reduced risk of rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt; and maybe even &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-mortality-study-11764737" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;helping you live longer&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that people with higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in their diets and blood have a lower risk of excessive daytime sleepiness. This is due to polyunsaturated fatty acids’ connection with better sleep. Work more of these healthy fats—found in fish, nuts and seeds—into your day and see if you sleep better at night.

Worsening fatigue, leg swelling, unusual chest pain, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, nausea, and back or belly pain are all ways heart disease can present in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Despite &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65370178/sleep-heart-health-menopause-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65370178/sleep-heart-health-menopause-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="heart disease" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; being the number one cause of death in women over 65, more men than women visit the emergency department for diseases of the circulatory system each year, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/dhcs/ed-visits/index.htm" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/dhcs/ed-visits/index.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Centers for Disease Control" data-node-id="10.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="10.3.0"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is partly because many women don’t know the symptoms they are experiencing are from a cardiac event, says Eleni Horattas-Collins, MD, an emergency medicine physician at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Sometimes women have back pain, and sometimes they just have shortness of breath, so they linger at home for a few days waiting for it to go away,” she says. “Once they come in, we realize that probably two or three days ago is when they had a significant event.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You should also pay attention if any of these symptoms get worse with exertion, says Ariel Wu, MD, former chief resident of the UCLA Emergency Medicine program. If you're walking or you're doing some kind of activity, and it makes your pain or fatigue worse and doesn't get better with rest, that’s “a textbook sign of an impending heart attack or blockage in arteries,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="13" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;Weakness On One Side Of Your Body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The most common symptom of a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65614968/ozempic-stroke-risk-new-studies/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65614968/ozempic-stroke-risk-new-studies/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="stroke" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; is the sudden onset of numbness or weakness in part of your body, like your face, arm, or leg—especially if it is just on one side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“If you're having weakness on one side of your body, then there's no time to waste,” says Dr. Jenkins. “Go directly to an emergency department."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;These symptoms can be coupled with sudden loss of vision, especially in one eye, and neurological symptoms like dizziness or room-spinning. Symptoms of a stroke are unique in that they come on very quickly, and sometimes, someone around you actually notices them first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And, for what it’s worth: Just because you are experiencing these symptoms doesn’t mean you are having a stroke. Women often get atypical migraines, which can mimic the symptoms of a stroke, Dr. Wu says. You may also be experiencing a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a39850199/hailey-bieber-mini-stroke-heart-surgery-youtube-video/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a39850199/hailey-bieber-mini-stroke-heart-surgery-youtube-video/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="mini-stroke" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;mini-stroke&lt;/a&gt;, which means the symptoms are temporary and will go away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But that’s not your job to figure out. “Don't worry about differentiating them,” Dr. Wu says. “Just get to the emergency department, and they'll take it from there.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="20" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;Heavy Vaginal Bleeding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you are experiencing abnormally &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65889912/fibroids-diagnosis-questions/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65889912/fibroids-diagnosis-questions/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="heavy bleeding" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;heavy bleeding&lt;/a&gt; during your period or passing large clots of blood (think: bigger than the size of a grape, per the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menorrhagia/expert-answers/blood-clots-during-menstruation/faq-20058401" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menorrhagia/expert-answers/blood-clots-during-menstruation/faq-20058401" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mayo Clinic" data-vars-ga-product-id="289ecc2f-c285-4357-97b6-9c3a79e3451a" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="21.3" data-href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menorrhagia/expert-answers/blood-clots-during-menstruation/faq-20058401" data-product-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menorrhagia/expert-answers/blood-clots-during-menstruation/faq-20058401" data-affiliate="false" data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-brand="Privacy Policy" data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="44dbae7f-4561-4810-847d-908a6b1638b6" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Privacy Policy" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-7bauu1 e1aq0z090"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="21.3.0"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), you should head to the emergency room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;How do you know if you’re bleeding more than usual? Pay attention to how many pads or tampons you’re going through. If you’re using more than you typically would, that’s one sign, Dr. Horattas-Collins. An elevated heart rate or lightheadedness can also signal that you’ve lost a significant amount of blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-14" data-node-id="23" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1pxfh3s e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-sh2zho e1pe3zr90"&gt;“[The emergency room] is never the wrong place to go."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Losing that much blood puts you at risk of hypovolemic shock, which occurs when the body doesn’t have enough blood to circulate oxygen and nutrients to your organs. This can be prevented by a simple blood transfusion in the emergency room, or sometimes a small gynecological procedure is necessary to prevent future blood loss, Dr. Jenkins says.&lt;br data-node-id="24.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Plus, if there is any possibility that you are pregnant and you are experiencing abnormal vaginal bleeding, especially if it is coupled with abdominal pain, it is important to come to the emergency room to ensure you are not having an ectopic pregnancy, Dr. Wu says. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a pregnancy occurs outside the uterus, often in the fallopian tube, and can be life-threatening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="26" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="26.0"&gt;Pain, Heavy Bleeding, Or Leg Swelling During Pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;As many people who have been pregnant know, different side effects come up during a pregnancy; often ones that can be handled with your OB-GYN at your check-ups. However, some symptoms, like severe abdominal pain and cramping, heavy vaginal bleeding, or a fever, are definitely worthy of going to the emergency room for an ultrasound, says Dr. Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Another symptom to look out for during pregnancy is leg swelling because this can be a sign of &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="preeclampsia" data-vars-ga-product-id="b5b4e3f3-bb13-499d-a381-b34e4f8bad87" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="28.1" data-href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745" data-product-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745" data-affiliate="false" data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="d5a141fa-9a3c-4b14-baa2-fa45b68f36fa" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-7bauu1 e1aq0z090"&gt;preeclampsia&lt;/a&gt;, she says. Preeclampsia is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the mother’s blood pressure rises during pregnancy. It is important to go to the emergency room so doctors can assess you and the baby, and help monitor blood pressure going forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="29" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="29.0"&gt;Heavy Bleeding, Lightheadedness, Or Surgery Complications Post-Delivery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you are experiencing heavy bleeding or lightheadedness after birth, you should go to the emergency room, Dr. Jenkins says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Heavy bleeding after a vaginal birth could be a sign that not all of the placenta and fetal tissue passed during the birth, according to a 2025 study in &lt;a href="https://www.jucm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-19821-27-Clinical.pdf" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.jucm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-19821-27-Clinical.pdf" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Journal of Urgent Care Medicine" data-node-id="31.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="31.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="31.1.0.0"&gt;The Journal of Urgent Care Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This means not all of the placenta and fetal tissue passed during the birth. Doctors will do an ultrasound to determine if this is the case, and can treat the condition with antibiotics or small gynecological procedures to remove the remaining tissue and stop the bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It is also important to remember that giving birth is a big deal and your body needs to recover, especially if you had a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a34618144/lindsay-arnold-cesarean-section-video/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a34618144/lindsay-arnold-cesarean-section-video/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cesarean section" data-node-id="33.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Cesarean section&lt;/a&gt;. Many new parents get caught up in the chaos of a newborn baby, so they don’t remember to check the surgical site in the days following their C-section, Dr. Jenkins says. If the site is red and swollen, or you have a fever, it could be a sign of an infection that needs immediate care, Dr. Jenkins says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="34" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="34.0"&gt;An Injury You Can’t Bear Weight On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you can’t bear weight on an injury, it’s a sign you broke a bone. While many urgent cares have X-rays, they are not always read by radiologists, Dr. Jenkins says, so the ER has a leg up when it comes to helping treat you. The ER can do X-rays and advanced imaging, like a CT scan, to show bone fractures that might not even show up on a regular X-ray. The ER can also do advanced splinting techniques to set your broken bone and can get you a consultation with orthopedic doctors attached to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You should also go to the ER if you are experiencing any neurological or vascular symptoms in your possibly broken limb, Dr. Horattas-Collins adds. “For example, if your arm is broken and you can't feel anything in your hand, or you’re not getting a pulse in your hand, that’s emergency level,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="37" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="37.0"&gt;Bleeding That Won’t Stop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Many cuts and scrapes can be managed at urgent care. Even if you need a few stitches, the doctors there should be able to do all sorts of basic laceration repairs, Dr. Wu says. However, if you have a cut that just won’t seem to stop bleeding, it’s a good idea to go to the emergency room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;She also recommends coming to the emergency room if you have a cut or scrape in a sensitive area, like your hand or face, that you are worried won’t heal on its own. This way you can get specialized care to prevent scarring and immobility as best you can.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="40" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="40.0"&gt;Signs Of A Head Injury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Head injuries are serious, and if you have signs of a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63545678/concussions-in-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63545678/concussions-in-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="concussion" data-node-id="41.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;concussion&lt;/a&gt; after hitting your head—like losing consciousness, nausea, bruising, or neck pain—you should definitely get it checked out at the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="42" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It is also important to mention if you take any blood thinners to your doctor when you present with a head injury, as this increases the likelihood of a brain bleed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="44" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Regardless of immediate reactions, make sure to monitor symptoms of a head injury for the first 24 to 36 hours after it occurs. Sometimes concussions reveal themselves as time goes on, so be on the lookout for a new headache, nausea, vomiting, or confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="45" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="45.0"&gt;If You Feel Like A Danger To Yourself Or Others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="46" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;People don’t traditionally think of the emergency room as a place to go for mental health concerns, but if you are worried about hurting yourself or hurting those around you, it is a safe place to go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="47" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“If you're feeling suicidal and you have a plan to hurt yourself, or maybe you're feeling unsafe with others, just go to an emergency department,” Dr. Wu says. “They will figure it out and bring you to the right place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="48" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Some emergency departments are part of hospitals with psychiatric departments or behavioral health teams that can work with patients to create a long-term plan for mental health care. They also might have a social work team to assist with other circumstances that can contribute to mental health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="50" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Even if the emergency room you end up at doesn’t have these services on site, they will know who to call to help you get the care you need. They can also help you figure out how to get help if you feel like you are in an unsafe domestic situation or an unsafe relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="51" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“It’s never the wrong place to go,” Dr. Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="er-or-urgent-care" data-node-id="52" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="52.0"&gt;ER or urgent care?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="53" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Experiencing a symptom not on this list and unsure about whether it’s ER-worthy or just requires a trip to your local urgent care? When thinking about whether or not you need to go to the emergency room, think about your condition in terms of chronicity and acuity, says Dr. Wu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="54" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="54.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="54.0.0"&gt;If you are concerned about a low-severity symptom related to a chronic condition&lt;/strong&gt; (for example, you suffer from migraines and are feeling the pain in a different spot than you usually do), you can bring it up with your primary care physician or specialized provider. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="54.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="54.1.0"&gt;If you are dealing with a chronic condition and experience a sudden, acute spike in symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;, you should go to the emergency room. “For example, some people have chronic pain that they’re on six different medications for, but suddenly the pain has gotten so bad that you can't eat, can't sleep, can't walk,” Dr. Wu says. “Please come to the emergency department.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="54.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="54.2.0"&gt;If an issue is low chronicity, meaning it’s acute, and low severity&lt;/strong&gt;—like a sore throat, a pain in your ear, or discomfort when you pee—go to urgent care. It’s the perfect place to go if you want immediate care, but are not worried that your life is in danger. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="54.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="54.3.0"&gt;If you’re experiencing an acute symptom that is severe&lt;/strong&gt;, go to the emergency room. “The party line is, if you think that you need to be evaluated in the emergency department, we always recommend that you err on the side of caution and come to the emergency department,” Dr. Horattas-Collins says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="55" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Plus, keep in mind, going to your primary care doc regularly might lower your risk of going to either the ER or urgent care. 40 percent of ER visits are preventable, according to a 2018 study in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6004969/#:~:text=Results,associated%20with%20potentially%20preventable%20events." data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6004969/#:~:text=Results,associated%20with%20potentially%20preventable%20events." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Permanente Journal" data-node-id="55.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="55.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="55.1.0.0"&gt;Permanente Journal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Preventive care is so important,” Dr. Wu says. “In the emergency department, we really lean on our outpatient and primary care to do the things that we can't do. We might be able to pull you back from the cliff when you're there, but it'd be great if we didn't approach it at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="56" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Obviously, emergencies &lt;em data-node-id="56.1"&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; pop up and not everyone has the resources for consistent primary care. You know your body better than anyone else and, when something feels seriously wrong, trust your instincts.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fermented pickles contain probiotics that can help support a healthy and diverse gut microbiome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-fermented pickles, made with vinegar, lack probiotics and may not offer gut-health benefits. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose lower-sodium pickles to support gut, heart and overall health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pickles can be polarizing—most people either love them or leave them on the side of the plate. And ideally, those two people dine together, because getting an extra pickle with your sandwich is a win (speaking from experience). But beyond their salty and tangy flavor, do pickles actually offer &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrients-for-gut-health-8574817" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-health benefits&lt;/a&gt;? The answer depends on how they are made. Here’s how to identify whether or not your pickles fit that bill. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-makes-a-food-gut-healthy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Makes a Food Gut-Healthy?  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to gut health, two nutrients often come up: &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052689/best-prebiotic-foods-for-better-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prebiotics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;. Prebiotics are a type of fiber that feeds the beneficial bacteria in your gut, while probiotics are living microbes that help support a healthy and diverse microbiome. Therefore, a food that contains either or both of these can make it beneficial for your gut. Plus, gut-healthy foods not only support your gut health, but also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;benefit your body as a whole&lt;/a&gt;, from your brain to your heart and even your immune system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, do pickles fall into these categories? It depends on the type. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-fermented-vs-non-fermented-pickles"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Fermented vs. Non-Fermented Pickles &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Fermented Pickles  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It might surprise you to hear that the original pickles were fermented. In fact, fermented pickles have become so popular that they remain a staple in many cuisines worldwide.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fermented pickles are made by submerging them in a saltwater brine (plus any additional desired seasonings) and leaving them at room temperature. Many recipes are measured by the weight of each ingredient used, and recommend adding 2 to 5% salt by weight compared to the weight of water that’s used. This salt percentage creates a safe environment for beneficial microbes to flourish, while keeping harmful ones at bay. Over time, generally after one to two weeks, these good bacteria produce lactic acid, which gives fermented pickles their signature tangy flavor.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These beneficial bacteria not only add great flavor to fermented pickles but also provide gut-healthy probiotics. And cucumbers aren’t the only veggie that can be fermented: cabbage (hello, sauerkraut) and radishes (a staple in some Korean kimchi) also benefit from this process.  You can make fermented pickles at home using proper sanitation practices and techniques, or  look for them at some grocery stores (check the refrigerated aisles if you’re having a hard time finding them). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these types of pickles are rich in probiotics, they can be relatively low in fiber depending on the vegetable you use. Cucumbers, for example, only contain 1 gram of fiber per ½ cup serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Non-Fermented Pickles  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most pickles you’ll find on the shelves are not fermented. These are typically made by adding the cucumbers to a tangy, vinegar-based brine. Adding vinegar to the vegetables helps to preserve them and create the desired pickled flavor, but it inhibits the growth of bacteria needed for fermentation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Non-fermented pickles are also typically stored in the refrigerator below 40℉, which is a temperature where fermentation can’t occur.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This means that non-fermented pickles won’t contain gut-healthy probiotics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What about prebiotics? The amount of prebiotic fiber in cucumber pickles is relatively low, as the lack of fermentation does not alter their fiber content. However, other pickled vegetables, like carrots and green beans, may offer slightly more.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That said, pickled vegetables aren’t the only source of prebiotics. Foods like potatoes, oats, garlic and artichokes offer more prebiotics and better support to your gut health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While non-fermented pickles can be a delicious addition to your diet, they are less likely to offer gut-health benefits when compared to fermented pickles. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-for-choosing-gut-healthy-pickles"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Tips for Choosing Gut-Healthy Pickles  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you enjoy pickles, they can absolutely be part of your healthy eating pattern. Here’s what to look for when shopping for pickles: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at the Ingredients List&lt;/strong&gt;: Fermented pickles should contain just the vegetable, salt, water and any seasonings used. If the ingredients list includes vinegar, it’s not fermented. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch Out for the Sodium&lt;/strong&gt;: Regardless of whether they are fermented or not, most pickles are high in sodium. That’s due to the salt that’s added for preservation and flavoring. Most Americans consume too much sodium in their daily diets, and excessive sodium intake can lead to long-term health consequences, including high blood pressure and adverse effects on gut health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When choosing pickles, compare labels to find a lower-sodium option. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While some pickles can offer impressive gut-health benefits, not all pickles are made in the same way. If gut health is your goal, opt for fermented pickles rather than non-fermented pickles since they contain probiotics (good-for-you bacteria). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both types of pickles are usually high in sodium, so it’s wise to look at the labels and opt for those with lower sodium content. Research has shown that high sodium intake can increase the risk of high blood pressure and can lead to adverse effects on the gut.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And for some, high-acid, high-sodium foods like pickles could lead to unpleasant digestive symptoms like reflux or bloating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, any type of pickle can fit into a healthy eating pattern if you enjoy them. And let’s be honest, they’re downright delicious, which is a good enough reason to enjoy them on occasion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 21:22:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE96WDRFVlJvS19qZ3pPYXo0bXVrTWRCdkg1TkZ6R0NtaGdFN01iRkVpQnYtYWpvenczdmg4MnF2Qk1oNnYwejIxUXZCcklGTkJXS2hRSGFCLWlSQklmVExtaFVDdkRjYTlFQ05B</guid></item><item><title>如果您年满65岁，仍然可以每天早上做这8件事，那么您的健康就在顶级- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/z-if-youre-over-65-and-can-still-do-these-8-things-every-morning-your-health-is-in-the-top-tier/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="417" data-end="592"&gt;A lot of people treat aging like a downhill slope. But the truth is, if you’re over 65 and can still handle certain everyday habits with ease, you’re doing better than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="594" data-end="782"&gt;It’s not about being able to run marathons or bench-press your body weight. The real markers of strong health are often tucked into the little things we do in the first hours of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="784" data-end="951"&gt;Morning routines reveal a lot. They test your balance, flexibility, cognition, energy, and even emotional health—all before you’ve finished your first cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="953" data-end="1065"&gt;Let’s break down eight simple morning abilities that reveal more about your health than any number on a chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1072" data-end="1109"&gt;1. Get out of bed without effort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1111" data-end="1288"&gt;Let’s start simple. If you can swing your legs out of bed and stand up without groaning, holding onto a dresser, or taking forever to find your balance, you’re in great shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1290" data-end="1505"&gt;Mobility and muscle strength naturally decline with age, but being able to rise smoothly from lying down is a powerful indicator of overall fitness. It shows your core, balance, and joints are all working in sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1507" data-end="1685"&gt;I remember staying with my grandfather in his late 70s—he never needed to “psych himself up” to get out of bed. He’d just get up, stretch, and move on. That’s health in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1687" data-end="2000"&gt;Physiotherapists often use simple functional tasks—like getting out of bed or rising from the floor—as quick gauges of mobility and independence. Studies show that&lt;a href="https://geriatrictoolkit.missouri.edu/srff/deBrito-Floor-Rise-Mortality-2012..pdf?.com"&gt; difficulty with these movements&lt;/a&gt; correlates with higher mortality risk and functional dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1687" data-end="2000"&gt;As one geriatric physical therapist put it: “The way someone gets out of bed is the way they’ll likely handle the rest of the day.” If it’s smooth and strong, you’re setting a solid tone for your morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2007" data-end="2036"&gt;2. Recall what day it is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2038" data-end="2213"&gt;Sounds small, right? But it’s actually huge. Waking up and immediately knowing the day, where you are, and what’s on your schedule is a sign your cognitive health is intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2215" data-end="2427"&gt;Neurologists often use orientation—&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/memory-loss-and-forgetfulness/memory-problems-forgetfulness-and-aging?.com"&gt;assessing awareness&lt;/a&gt; of time, place, person, and situation—as a quick check of brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2429" data-end="2612"&gt;As the National Institute on Aging points out, “Cognitive changes are a normal part of aging, but significant memory loss is not.” Waking up clear-minded already gives you an edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2614" data-end="2978"&gt;I once stayed with a family friend in Spain who was in her 80s. Every morning, she would look at the calendar pinned to her fridge and say out loud, “It’s Wednesday, I have market today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2614" data-end="2978"&gt;It wasn’t because she was forgetful—it was because she liked reinforcing clarity. And she never missed a detail. That small act reflected how intact her mental sharpness was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2985" data-end="3025"&gt;3. Get dressed without needing help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3027" data-end="3182"&gt;Pulling on a pair of pants, fastening buttons, or slipping on shoes doesn’t sound like much—but it actually requires flexibility, dexterity, and balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3184" data-end="3446"&gt;When I was traveling in Japan, I noticed how older adults there often prided themselves on maintaining independence in daily activities. They saw being able to dress themselves as a core part of dignity. And they weren’t wrong—it’s an underrated health marker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3448" data-end="3664"&gt;If you can manage your clothing without getting tangled up or losing your footing, you’re keeping independence alive. It’s also a subtle sign that arthritis or other mobility-limiting conditions haven’t taken over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3666" data-end="3950"&gt;And here’s the thing: small motor skills like buttoning a shirt are actually &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00910/full?.com"&gt;linked to brain health&lt;/a&gt; too. Fine motor control requires coordination between your nervous system and muscles. If you can manage it seamlessly, it’s a two-for-one check of physical and cognitive resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3957" data-end="4015"&gt;4. Walk to the kitchen without aches slowing you down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4017" data-end="4182"&gt;Can you make it from the bedroom to the kitchen with a steady pace, without joints locking up or pain forcing you to stop? If so, your mobility is in the top tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4184" data-end="4419"&gt;Walking is one of those things most of us take for granted until it’s gone. Morning movement without discomfort means your joints are holding up, your circulation is working, and your heart is strong enough to handle simple exertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4421" data-end="4663"&gt;Doctors often use the “timed up and go” test to measure mobility in older adults. It’s exactly what it sounds like: stand up, walk a short distance, turn, and sit back down. If you can do that easily in the morning, you’re beating the odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4665" data-end="4993"&gt;When I spent a summer in Lisbon, I’d often see groups of older locals walking briskly to the café first thing in the morning. No limping, no hesitation—just a steady stride. They weren’t walking for exercise, they were walking for life. That’s what good health really looks like: the freedom to move without thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5000" data-end="5031"&gt;5. Make yourself breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5033" data-end="5153"&gt;Cooking—even something simple like oatmeal or toast—requires a blend of fine motor skills, problem-solving, and focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5155" data-end="5362"&gt;You’re standing, moving, stirring, maybe slicing some fruit. That’s coordination and stability at work. Plus, there’s the decision-making part: choosing what to eat, prepping it, and cleaning up afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5364" data-end="5620"&gt;As geriatric specialists note, “Instrumental activities of daily living” (things like cooking or managing finances) are some of the best measures of functional independence. If breakfast isn’t a challenge, your brain and body are cooperating beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5622" data-end="5840"&gt;There’s also something deeper here: the ritual of making food signals you’re still engaged with life. You’re not just grabbing whatever’s easiest—you’re participating in your own well-being. And that mindset matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5847" data-end="5889"&gt;6. Use technology without frustration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5891" data-end="6027"&gt;Checking your phone, texting a grandchild, or skimming the news on a tablet might not seem like health markers, but they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6029" data-end="6227"&gt;Tech use relies on memory (remembering how apps work), motor skills (swiping, typing), and vision. Being able to handle this fluidly means you’ve kept pace with both cognitive and sensory demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6229" data-end="6452"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before in another piece: adaptability is one of the most overlooked signs of mental resilience. If you’re still adapting to new tools and apps, it’s a very good sign you’re keeping your brain flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6454" data-end="6718"&gt;As psychologist Carol Dweck noted, “Becoming is better than being.” The willingness to learn—even when it’s something as simple as figuring out how to adjust text size on your phone—signals a growth mindset. And that mindset is a powerful buffer against decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6725" data-end="6764"&gt;7. Do light exercise or stretching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6766" data-end="6908"&gt;If your morning includes even a few minutes of stretching, yoga, or a quick walk around the block, you’re investing in your future mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6910" data-end="7120"&gt;Exercise isn’t just about fitness—it keeps bones strong, maintains balance, and lowers the risk of falls. &lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;Long-term, moderate-intensity, multicomponent exercise (combining strength, balance, and flexibility) is shown to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2719424?.com"&gt;reduce fall risk by up to 34%&lt;/a&gt; in older adults.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7122" data-end="7414"&gt;I once stayed in a small town in Italy where older folks met in the town square to do stretches together before heading off to errands. Some used canes, some didn’t. But they all showed up daily. The community, the movement, the routine—it all worked together to keep them sharp and strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7416" data-end="7528"&gt;If your morning involves intentional movement, you’re stacking the odds in your favor for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7535" data-end="7569"&gt;8. Feel ready to face the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7571" data-end="7763"&gt;Here’s one that’s less physical and more about energy and mood. If you wake up with enough mental drive to look forward to the day ahead—rather than dreading it—you’re doing something right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7765" data-end="7900"&gt;Morning vitality reflects both mental and physical well-being. Sleep quality, emotional health, and energy balance all converge here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7902" data-end="8113"&gt;Experts like Dr. Andrew Huberman highlight how early-day light exposure and &lt;a href="https://biologyinsights.com/andrew-huberman-articles-where-to-find-his-content/?.com"&gt;structured morning routines&lt;/a&gt; help regulate the nervous system, setting emotional tone and cognitive clarity for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8115" data-end="8399"&gt;And here’s the kicker: purpose plays into this too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8115" data-end="8399"&gt;A recent study published in the &lt;em data-start="84" data-end="126"&gt;American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; tracked over 13,000 adults aged 45+ for up to 15 years and found that those with a strong sense of purpose were &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/this-simple-daily-habit-can-protect-the-brain-from-dementia/photostory/123518852.cms?.com"&gt;28% less likely to develop cognitive impairments like dementia&lt;/a&gt;, even after adjusting for education and genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8115" data-end="8399"&gt;So if you’re waking up motivated, it’s not just mood—it’s a real health advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8406" data-end="8426"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8428" data-end="8583"&gt;Health over 65 isn’t about comparing yourself to twenty-year-olds—it’s about sustaining independence, energy, and clarity in the things that matter most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8585" data-end="8770"&gt;If you can get up, get dressed, move around, think clearly, make breakfast, use a bit of tech, stretch, and feel energized—all before noon—you’re not just doing fine. You’re thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8772" data-end="8817"&gt;And that, in my book, is the real top tier.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are mostly but not entirely human. If we crunch the numbers, 8% of your genome actually comes from viruses that got stranded there. This viral detritus is a souvenir from our evolutionary past, a reminder that viruses have been with us from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Usually, this 8% of your DNA—the viral bits—are kept silent. Scientists call it part of the "dark matter" in your genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now scientists at La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) have published a first look at a key viral protein. In a study published in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady8168" target="_blank"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, LJI researchers revealed the first three-dimensional structure of a protein from one of these ancient "human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team mapped the surface envelope glycoprotein (Env), the antibody target of the most active HERV, marking a milestone in structural biology. "This is the first human HERV protein structure ever solved—and only the third retroviral envelope structure solved overall, after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)," says Erica Ollmann Saphire, Ph.D., MBA, LJI President, CEO, and Professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery opens the door to new strategies for diagnosing and treating disease. Back in the evolutionary past, HERV-K Env proteins studded the outside of the HERV-K retroviruses. But in modern humans, HERV-K Env proteins show up on the surface of certain tumor cells and in patients with autoimmune and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/neurodegenerative+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;, making them a valuable target for developing novel diagnostics and therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In many disease states, like &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/autoimmune+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;autoimmune diseases&lt;/a&gt; and cancer, these genes re-awaken and start making pieces of these viruses," says Saphire. "Understanding the HERV-K Env structure, and the antibodies we now have, opens up diagnostic and treatment opportunities."&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;An unexpected 'twist'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, HERV proteins had been invisible. They've proven too mobile—and too twitchy—to be seen with even the most sophisticated imaging techniques. Solving the structure of HERV-K Env was especially challenging because the LJI team needed to capture the protein's delicate "pre-fusion" state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envelope proteins are full of potential energy—they're essentially spring-loaded to merge with a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/host+cell/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;host cell&lt;/a&gt; to start the infection process. This means pre-fusion proteins are prone to spontaneous switching to their later, post-fusion state. "You can look at them funny, and they'll unfold," says LJI Postdoctoral Fellow Jeremy Shek, who spearheaded the study as co-first author with LJI Postdoctoral Fellow Chen Sun, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study the three-dimensional structure of HERV-K Env, the researchers introduced small substitutions to lock the protein's structure in place, while preserving its natural shape. Saphire and her team have used this approach before to reveal the structures of key proteins on Ebola virus, Lassa virus, and more. The researchers also discovered and characterized specific antibodies that helped anchor different versions of the viral proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After stabilizing their HERV-K Env structures, the LJI team used a high-resolution imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy to capture 3D images of HERV-K Env at three key moments: cell surface, in the act of driving infection, and when it locks together with antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many viral envelope glycoproteins have a trimer structure, but HERV-K Env is different from anything scientists had seen before, including trimers from other retroviruses. Unlike the shorter, squatter trimers made by HIV and SIV, the HERV-K Env is tall and lean. Further, the protein's fold—the weaving together of strands and coils that build the working machine—is unlike any other retrovirus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;A new path for clinical research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new LJI study opens the door to using HERV-K Env to our advantage. Understanding the HERV-K Env structure, and how antibodies target it, may prove useful for developing diagnostic tools or new therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, many types of cancer cells—from breast cancers to ovarian cancers—but not healthy cells, are dotted with HERV-K Env proteins. This means antibodies against HERV could distinguish cancer cells from healthy cells. As Sun explains, scientists could develop cancer immunotherapies that zero in on HERV-K Env to track down tumor cells. "We can use it as a strategy to specifically target cancer cells," says Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with autoimmune diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis also express HERV-K Env on their cells. Some scientists suspect that patients' immune cells see these strange proteins and think the body is under attack. Just like during a normal viral infection, their B cells start making antibodies against HERV-K Env proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Understanding how antibodies recognize these proteins was challenging because there was no structure and precious few good antibodies yet available," says Saphire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the LJI team made their own panel of antibodies to reveal how the immune system can target the different subunits of the molecule in all its different shapes. Once scientists understand how these antibody attacks work, they can try to intervene and stop harmful inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists also tested the idea that their antibodies may also be useful tools for diagnosing many autoimmune diseases. They used the antibodies to try and hunt down immune cells in samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. When Saphire and her colleagues tagged these antibodies with a molecular flag, they were able to quickly detect HERV-K Env on neutrophils, a type of immune cell that can cause inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These antibodies marked aberrant HERV display on neutrophils from rheumatoid arthritis and lupus patients, but not healthy controls," says Saphire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interest in HERVs is quickly growing, and scientists are finding more and more diseases where HERV-K Env crops up. "We can really pick whatever disease we're interested in and go down that route," says Shek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These projects may someday advance clinical care—and our fundamental understanding of human biology. After all, we're all part virus. It's time to get to know that part of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

Across 124 patients followed for up to 18 months, participants consistently reported improved sleep quality, less anxiety and depression, and a better overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients also noted reduced pain, while side effects remained mild and manageable. Though randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness, the findings point to medical cannabis as a possible option when conventional therapies fall short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustained Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep quality improved and lasted for 18 months of treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients also reported lower anxiety, depression, and pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mild Side Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Only 9% experienced fatigue, dry mouth, or insomnia, with no serious events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insomnia patients taking cannabis-based medical products reported better quality sleep after up to 18 months of treatment, according to a study published August 27 in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Mental Health&lt;/em&gt; by Arushika Aggarwal from Imperial College London, U.K., and colleagues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one out of every three people has some trouble getting a good night’s rest, and 10 percent of adults meet the criteria for an insomnia disorder. But current treatments can be difficult to obtain, and the drugs approved for insomnia run the risk of dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how cannabis-based medical products might affect insomnia symptoms, the authors of this study analyzed a set of 124 insomnia patients taking medical cannabis products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They examined the patient’s reports of their sleep quality, anxiety/depression, and quality of life changes between one and 18 months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients reported improved sleep quality that lasted over the 18 months of treatment. They also showed significant improvements in anxiety/depression as well as reporting less pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About nine percent of the patients reported adverse effects such as fatigue, insomnia, or dry mouth, but none of the side effects were life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While randomized controlled trials will be needed to prove that the products are safe and effective, the authors suggest that cannabis-based medical products could improve sleep quality in insomnia patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Dr. Simon Erridge, Research Director at Curaleaf Clinic, summarizes: “Over an 18-month period, our study showed that treatment for insomnia with cannabis-based medicinal products was associated with sustained improvements in subjective sleep quality and anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings support the potential role of medical cannabis as a medical option where conventional treatments have proven ineffective, though further randomised trials are needed to confirm long-term efficacy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: “Conducting this long-term study provided valuable real-world evidence on patient outcomes that go beyond what we typically see in short-term trials. It was particularly interesting to observe signs of potential tolerance over time, which highlights the importance of continued monitoring and individualised treatment plans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and insomnia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1b76716b697e68685b6b7774683574697c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Charlotte Bhaskar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Charlotte Bhaskar – PLOS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmen.0000390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UK Medical Cannabis Registry: A clinical outcomes analysis for insomnia&lt;/a&gt;” by Arushika Aggarwal et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOs Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK Medical Cannabis Registry: A clinical outcomes analysis for insomnia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insomnia affects approximately 10% of adults globally. Current treatments have their limitations, and there is growing evidence on the therapeutic potential of cannabis-based medicinal products for insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to assess changes in sleep-specific and general patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in individuals prescribed cannabis-based medicinal products for insomnia and to assess the incidence of adverse events. A case series was analysed with patients diagnosed with primary insomnia from the UK Medical Cannabis Registry (UKMCR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome examined changes in the Single-Item Sleep Quality Scale (SQS), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L). Changes in PROMs were assessed from baseline to 1-, 3-, 6-, 12- and 18-months. Adverse events were classified according to the CTCAE version 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inclusion criteria were met by 124 participants. SQS scores showed improvement from baseline (2.66 ± 2.41) to 1- (5.67 ± 2.65; p &amp;lt; 0.001), 3- (5.41 ± 2.69; p &amp;lt; 0.001), 6- (4.80 ± 2.89; p &amp;lt; 0.001), 12- (4.24 ± 3.01; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and 18-months (3.81 ± 2.90; p &amp;lt; 0.001). GAD-7 scores improved from baseline to 1-, 3-, 6-, 12- and 18-months (p &amp;lt; 0.050).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also improvements in EQ-5D-5L dimensions of usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, and index values (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Eleven (8.87%) participants reported a total of 112 (90.32%) adverse events, but none were disabling or life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study demonstrated improvements in subjective sleep quality and other captured PROMs in insomnia patients treated with cannabis-based medicinal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the treatment was generally well-tolerated, randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of cannabis-based medicinal products.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 20:34:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE82SnU1VzZrNU0zOGYzemxOU1hWTDlIbmdBVUU0cFVINndGQ2h4UTFqa0dpVFVVc0gyNncyX296ZXBBUXYwcDBmNlZLWHdfSnFjYWZPREJ5WFhERzlhUVdyaUs1UGtjbHN2djU5MjdB</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心削减了食品安全监测，现在仅跟踪8个主要感染中的2个- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/08/cdc-stopped-actively-tracking-6-foodborne-infections-amid-budget-cuts/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;In July, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dramatically, but quietly, scaled back a food safety surveillance system, cutting active tracking from eight top foodborne infections down to just two, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-quietly-scaled-back-surveillance-program-foodborne-illnesses-rcna227089"&gt;according to a report by NBC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet)—a network of surveillance sites that spans 10 states and covers about 54 million Americans (16 percent of the US population)—previously included active monitoring for eight infections from pathogens. Those include &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cyclosporiasis/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyclospora&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/about/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listeria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/general/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/about/"&gt;Shiga toxin-producing &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (STEC), &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/about/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibrio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yersinia/about/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yersinia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the network is only monitoring for STEC and &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list of talking points the CDC sent the Connecticut health department (which is part of FoodNet) suggested that a lack of funding is behind the scaleback. "Funding has not kept pace with the resources required to maintain the continuation of FoodNet surveillance for all eight pathogens," the CDC document said, according to NBC. The Trump administration has made brutal cuts to federal agencies, including the CDC, which has lost hundreds of employees this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokesperson told the outlet that "Although FoodNet will narrow its focus to Salmonella and STEC, it will maintain both its infrastructure and the quality it has come to represent. Narrowing FoodNet’s reporting requirements and associated activities will allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers have uncovered direct genomic evidence of the bacterium behind the Plague of Justinian—the world's first recorded pandemic—in the Eastern Mediterranean, where the outbreak was first described nearly 1,500 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The discovery, led by an interdisciplinary team at the University of South Florida and Florida Atlantic University, with collaborators in India and Australia, identified Yersinia pestis, the microbe that causes plague, in a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mass+grave/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mass grave&lt;/a&gt; at the ancient city of Jerash, Jordan, near the pandemic's epicenter. The find definitively links the pathogen to the Justinian Plague marking the first pandemic (AD 541–750), resolving one of history's long-standing mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For centuries, historians have deliberated on what caused the devastating outbreak that killed tens of millions, reshaped the Byzantine Empire and altered the course of Western civilization. Despite circumstantial evidence, direct proof of the responsible microbe had remained elusive—a missing link in the story of pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two newly published papers led by USF and FAU provide these long-sought answers, offering new insight into one of the most consequential episodes in human history. The discovery, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/16/8/926" target="_blank"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Genes&lt;/i&gt;, also underscores plague's ongoing relevance today: while rare, Y. pestis continues to circulate worldwide. In July, a resident of northern Arizona died from &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/pneumonic+plague/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pneumonic plague&lt;/a&gt;, the most lethal form of Y. pestis infection, marking the first such fatality in the U.S. since 2007, and just last week another individual in California tested positive for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"This discovery provides the long-sought definitive proof of Y. pestis at the epicenter of the Plague of Justinian," said Rays H. Y. Jiang, Ph.D., lead PI of the studies and associate professor with the USF College of Public Health. "For centuries, we've relied on written accounts describing a devastating disease, but lacked any hard biological evidence of plague's presence. Our findings provide the missing piece of that puzzle, offering the first direct genetic window into how this pandemic unfolded at the heart of the empire."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plague of Justinian first appeared in the historical record in Pelusium (present day Tell el-Farama) in Egypt before spreading throughout the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire. While traces of Y. pestis had previously been recovered thousands of miles away in small western European villages, no evidence had ever been found within the empire itself or near the heart of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using targeted ancient DNA techniques, we successfully recovered and sequenced &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/genetic+material/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic material&lt;/a&gt; from eight human teeth excavated from burial chambers beneath the former Roman hippodrome in Jerash, a city just 200 miles from ancient Pelusium" said Greg O'Corry-Crowe, Ph.D., co-author and a research professor at FAU Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute and a National Geographic Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arena had been repurposed as a mass grave during the mid-sixth to early seventh century, when written accounts describe a sudden wave of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Genomic analysis revealed that the plague victims carried nearly identical strains of Y. pestis, confirming for the first time that the bacterium was present within the Byzantine Empire between AD 550-660. That genetic uniformity suggests a rapid, devastating outbreak consistent with historical descriptions of a plague causing mass death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Jerash site offers a rare glimpse of how ancient societies responded to public health disaster," said Jiang. "Jerash was one of the key cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, a documented trade hub with magnificent structures. That a venue once built for entertainment and civic pride became a mass cemetery in a time of emergency shows how urban centers were very likely overwhelmed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A companion study &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/14/8/797" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Pathogens&lt;/i&gt;, also led by USF and FAU, places the Jerash discovery into a wider evolutionary context. By analyzing hundreds of ancient and modern Y. pestis genomes—including those newly recovered from Jerash—the researchers showed that the bacteria had been circulating among human populations for millennia before the Justinian outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found that later plague pandemics, from the Black Death of the 14th century to cases still appearing today, did not descend from a single ancestral strain. Instead, they arose independently and repeatedly from longstanding animal reservoirs, erupting in multiple waves across different regions and eras. This repeated pattern stands in stark contrast to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19), which originated from a single spillover event and evolved primarily through human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Together, the findings reshape the understanding of how pandemics emerge, recur and spread, and why they remain a persistent feature of human civilization. The research underscores that pandemics are not singular historical catastrophes, but repeating biological events driven by human congregation, mobility and environmental change—themes that remain relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research was both scientifically compelling and personally resonant. It offered an extraordinary opportunity to delve into the study of human history through the lens of ancient DNA at a time when we ourselves were living through a global pandemic," said O'Corry-Crowe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Equally profound was the experience of working with ancient human remains—individuals who lived, suffered, and died centuries ago—and using modern science to help recover and share their stories. It's a humbling reminder of our shared humanity across time and a moving testament to the power of science to give voice to those long silent."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While very different from COVID-19, both diseases highlight the enduring link between connectivity and pandemic risk, as well as the reality that some pathogens can never be fully eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've been wrestling with plague for a few thousand years and people still die from it today," said Jiang. "Like COVID, it continues to evolve, and containment measures evidently can't get rid of it. We have to be careful, but the threat will never go away."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the Jerash breakthrough, the team is now expanding its research to Venice, Italy and the Lazaretto Vecchio, a dedicated quarantine island and one the world's most significant plague burial sites. More than 1,200 samples from this Black Death-era mass grave are now housed at USF, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study how early public health measures intersected with pathogen evolution, urban vulnerability and cultural memory.&lt;/p&gt;

The trial was randomized, meaning participants were randomly placed in a treatment group or a comparison group that didn't receive the intensive gum treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="d14671e6-4007-4f8c-898b-d320157f52fa"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;An ultrasound screen showing the 2D image of the common carotid segment. The central black area is the channel within the carotid blood vessel, and the more defined layers on each side of this central channel are the artery walls. The periphery of the image shows the soft tissues surrounding the artery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Marco Orlandi)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="27e2bbc4-c252-4603-b2ba-7374aa03fbf9"&gt;First, the researchers took ultrasounds of the carotid arteries of 135 people with severe periodontitis, to establish a baseline level of thickness. They also measured how much the arteries dilated when blood flow increased — a measure of blood vessel functioning — and took blood samples to pinpoint markers of inflammatory and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-oxidative-stress" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-oxidative-stress"&gt;&lt;u&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. All of the individuals were healthy besides having gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the participants were randomly divided into either the treatment group or the control group. Care was taken to ensure there was a roughly even split between the two groups in terms of the participants' periodontitis severity, smoking status and family history of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the treatment group, patients received intensive periodontitis treatment: a thorough clean of the whole mouth and a deep clean below the gumline to remove plaque and tartar. The control group received a simple scale and polish, more akin to a regular dental cleaning that doesn't include a deep clean of the gums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were then followed for two years, and they each received further dental treatments at regular intervals throughout that time. The researchers also reassessed the carotid artery at the one-year and two-year marks, and took blood samples and measured blood-vessel function at five time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the thickness of the carotid arteries' innermost linings was lower for individuals who received intensive treatment than for those in the control group. This difference was "comparable to what has been seen with lifestyle interventions and some pharmacological agents in similar populations," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/5705-francesco-d'aiuto" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/5705-francesco-d'aiuto" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Francesco D'Aiuto&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical research periodontist at University College London, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treated patients also had better blood vessel function and lower levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in their blood, which are known to contribute to the narrowing of artery walls — a condition called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/coronary-artery-disease-cad-causes-diagnosis-and-treatment" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/coronary-artery-disease-cad-causes-diagnosis-and-treatment"&gt;&lt;u&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many factors drive atherosclerosis, "our results reinforce the view that untreated periodontitis is a modifiable risk factor for vascular ageing and possibly cardiovascular events," D'Aiuto said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a key limitation of the research is that it was conducted in only one location, so there is a chance that the findings partly come down to quirks of the location or the people in the sample, Orlandi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="bc667cdc-20da-462d-8431-08aad054d037"&gt;Another limitation, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.efp.org/for-patients/gum-disease-general-health/perio-caries/overview/our-experts/maurizio-tonetti/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.efp.org/for-patients/gum-disease-general-health/perio-caries/overview/our-experts/maurizio-tonetti/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Maurizio Tonetti&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical and research periodontist at the University of Hong Kong who was not involved in the research, is that all of the participants in the trial were healthy other than having periodontitis. As such, these results should not be interpreted as evidence that if someone with atherosclerosis has their gum disease treated, the health of their arteries will improve, he told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the findings "are bringing the concept of these [intensive gum disease] interventions into the preservation of wellness," Tonetti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For many, many years, dentists have been focusing on the teeth, forgetting the rest of the body, and physicians have been focusing on the body, forgetting that there are teeth," he said. "They are really two worlds that have been separated and need to go back together for the benefit of patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-pQitSfqkt6kwnnZLMgtyDN-hhhCWlAmIdMnJ6RHycPhxNCAsQWe4AAl" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-pQitSfqkt6kwnnZLMgtyDN-hhhCWlAmIdMnJ6RHycPhxNCAsQWe4AAl slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to boost brain power, from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-boost-linked-to-exercise-can-last-several-years-scientists-find"&gt;exercising more often&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-training-may-not-work-but-there-is-a-way-to-boost-your-cognition"&gt;learning new skills.&lt;/a&gt; But what about boosting the actual size of your brain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, wearing the right kind of perfume or cologne can enlarge your brain's gray matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Kyoto University and the University of Tsukuba in Japan asked 28 women to wear a specific rose scent oil on their clothing for a month, with another 22 volunteers enlisted &lt;a href="https://bioivt.com/blogs/control-matrices"&gt;as controls&lt;/a&gt; who put on plain water instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="172160" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="172160" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt;) scans showed boosts in the gray matter volume of the rose scent participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While an increase in brain volume doesn't necessarily translate into more thinking power, the findings could have implications for neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-link-between-menthol-and-alzheimers-found-in-mice"&gt;Surprise Link Between Menthol And Alzheimer's Found in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study is the first to show that continuous scent inhalation changes brain structure," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2024.110896"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've seen scents like this &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2023.1200448"&gt;improve memory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-function-dramatically-boosted-by-certain-fragrances-during-sleep"&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;, but here the team wanted to try a longer-term experiment to see how triggering our sense of smell might lead to measurable changes in brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172164" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainDiagram.jpg" alt="Brain diagram" class="wp-image-172164 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainDiagram-593x415.jpg 593w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainDiagram-600x420.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172164" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers compared changes in the amount of gray matter tissue in specific areas of the brain. (Kokubun et al, &lt;em&gt;Brain Res. Bull.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While overall gray matter increased, the difference varied by region. There was little change in the amygdala (where emotions are managed) or in the orbitofrontal cortex (where nice smells are processed). But there was significantly more gray matter in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cingulate_cortex"&gt;posterior cingulate cortex&lt;/a&gt; or PCC (linked to memory and association).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83621-2"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that in people who have problems with their olfactory system, the amygdala (directly linked to smell) is less active, while the posterior cingulate cortex (indirectly linked to smell) is more active. The brain overcompensates, in a way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest something similar might be happening here. The amygdala doesn't have to keep alerting the brain to the rose scent, because it's always there – but the posterior cingulate cortex has to continually process it and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brains-memory-center-never-stops-making-neurons-study-confirms"&gt;store related memories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The PCC is involved in memory-odor associations, odor memory retrieval, and semantic memory processes," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2024.110896"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The PCC, which processes odor memories, was more activated than the amygdala, which is responsible for sensing odors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's difficult to pin down exactly what's causing this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bilingual-brains-have-higher-volume-of-grey-matter-study-suggests"&gt;boost in gray matter&lt;/a&gt;. Another possibility raised by the researchers is that the rose scent is actually labeled as unpleasant by the brain, with the subsequent emotional regulation responsible for the PCC working harder and increasing in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that the findings could be useful in the development of aromatherapies that boost mental health and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-layers-of-your-brain-actually-get-stronger-as-you-age"&gt;brain plasticity&lt;/a&gt;. Adding a scent to clothing would be just like wearing perfume or aftershave – a cheap, easy to potentially benefit the health of your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the line, with further testing on different types of scents and bigger groups of people, the discoveries here could even be used to reduce the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PCC is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pscychresns.2015.01.018"&gt;known to shrink&lt;/a&gt; in people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="172160" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, and keeping it stimulated with fragrances could be a way of keeping this part of the brain active and functioning well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Therefore, the result of the current study suggests that continuous inhalation of rose essential oil may prevent brain atrophy and prevent dementia," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2024.110896"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2024.110896"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Research Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Using self-reports and brain imaging, scientists found that HVB both activated the body’s stress response and increased blood flow to emotion-processing regions like the amygdala and hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes correlated with bliss, emotional release, and unity, known as “oceanic boundlessness.” Participants consistently reported reduced fear and negative emotions, highlighting breathwork’s potential as a non-pharmacological therapeutic tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelic-Like States:&lt;/strong&gt; Breathwork evoked sensations of bliss, unity, and emotional breakthrough comparable to psychedelics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Blood Flow Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; HVB decreased blood flow globally but boosted activity in the amygdala and hippocampus, tied to emotion and memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants reported reduced fear and negative emotions across all sessions with no adverse effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathwork while listening to music may induce a blissful state in practitioners, accompanied by changes in blood flow to emotion-processing brain regions, according to a study published August 27, 2025, in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; by Amy Amla Kartar from the Colasanti Lab in the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, U.K., and colleagues. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes occur even while the body’s stress response may be activated and are associated with reporting reduced negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popularity of breathwork as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding. Breathwork practices that increase ventilatory rate or depth, accompanied by music, can lead to altered states of consciousness (ASCs) similar to those evoked by psychedelic substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High ventilation breathwork (HVB) might offer a non-pharmacological alternative, with fewer legal and ethical restrictions to large-scale adoption in clinical treatment. However, the neurobiological mechanisms and subjective experience underlying ASCs induced by HVB have not been studied extensively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fill this knowledge gap, Kartar and colleagues characterized ASCs induced by HVB in experienced practitioners by analyzing self-reported data from 15 individuals who participated online, 8 individuals who participated in the lab, and 19 individuals who underwent magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their task consisted of a 20- to 30-minute session of cyclic breathing without pausing while listening to music, followed by a series of questionnaires within 30 minutes of finishing the breathwork session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the intensity of ASCs evoked by HVB was proportional to cardiovascular sympathetic activation, as indicated by a decrease in heart rate variability, indicating a potential stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, HVB-evoked ASCs were associated with a profound decrease in blood flow to the left operculum and posterior insula – brain regions implicated in representing the internal state of the body, including breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, despite HVB causing large and global reductions in blood flow to the brain, there was a progressive increase in blood flow during the session to the right amygdala and anterior hippocampus, which are brain regions involved in the processing of emotional memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These blood flow changes correlated with psychedelic experiences, demonstrating that these alterations may underlie the positive effects of this breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During all experimental sessions, participants reported a reduction in fear and negative emotions, with no adverse reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across participants and experimental settings, HVB reliably enhanced ASCs dominated by Oceanic Boundlessness (OBN), which is a term coined by Freud in 1920 that describes a set of related feelings including spiritual experience, insightfulness, blissful state, positively experienced depersonalization, and the experience of unity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OBN is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, their study was novel and exploratory and requires replication by future research including larger sample sizes and a control group to separate the effects of music on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the findings provide a better understanding of HVB and direct research to investigate its therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add: “Our research is the first to use neuroimaging to map the neurophysiological changes that occur during breathwork. Our key findings include that breathwork can reliably evoke profound psychedelic states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that these states are linked to changes in the function of specific brain regions involved in self-awareness, and fear and emotional memory processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that more profound changes in blood flow in specific brain areas were linked to deeper sensations of unity, bliss, and emotional release, collectively known as “oceanic boundlessness”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy Kartar, lead author, adds: “Conducting this research was a fantastic experience. It was thrilling to explore such a novel area – while many people anecdotally recognize the health benefits of breathwork, this style of fast-paced breathing has received very little scientific attention. We are very grateful to our participants for making this work possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alessandro Colasanti, P.I., adds: “Breathwork is a powerful yet natural tool for neuromodulation, working through the regulation of metabolism across the body and brain. It holds tremendous promise as a transformative therapeutic intervention for conditions that are often both distressing and disabling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this music and consciousness research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#47282922373522343407372b283469283520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hanna Abdallah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hanna Abdallah – PLOS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neurobiological substrates of altered states of consciousness induced by high ventilation breathwork accompanied by music&lt;/a&gt;” by Amy Kartar et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurobiological substrates of altered states of consciousness induced by high ventilation breathwork accompanied by music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popularity of breathwork as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breathwork practices that increase ventilatory rate or depth, facilitated by music, can evoke subjective experiential states analogous to altered states of consciousness (ASCs) evoked by psychedelic substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These states include components such as euphoria, bliss, and perceptual differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the profound subjective effects of high ventilation breathwork (HVB) remain largely unknown and unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated the neurobiological substrates of ASCs induced by HVB in experienced practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that the intensity of ASCs evoked by HVB was proportional to cardiovascular sympathetic activation and to haemodynamic alterations in cerebral perfusion within clusters spanning the left operculum/posterior insula and right amygdala/anterior hippocampus;

That choice made any between twin differences more likely to reflect the supplement rather than family background or shared habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-changed-in-the-gut"&gt;What changed in the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prebiotics are food components that our enzymes do not digest, so bacteria ferment them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, relative levels of specific microbes shifted, including an increase in Bifidobacterium, a genus that often responds to inulin and fructooligosaccharides in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9413759/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;controlled trials.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants tolerated the supplement well, with only mild, expected gastrointestinal complaints reported. Adherence stayed high throughout the 3 month window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifts in the gut community did not upend overall diversity. Instead, a few taxa moved in meaningful ways that are biologically plausible for fiber fermenters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prebiotic group scored higher on a combined cognition factor and made fewer errors on the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-international-neuropsychological-society/article/paired-associate-performance-in-the-early-detection-of-dat/1AFD16E84A939D43AD0A5BF100CDF8AD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PAL test,&lt;/a&gt; a visual paired associated task sensitive to early Alzheimer’s related change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern fits with decades of work showing PAL detects subtle episodic memory problems before many standard clinic scales do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to see these changes in just 12 weeks. This holds huge promise for enhancing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brain-map-shows-how-rhythms-instantly-reconfigure-your-mind-freq-ness/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; health and memory in our ageing population,” said Dr. Lochlainn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specific test improvement matters because paired associates learning taps the ability to form new connections between locations and patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a core function that erodes early in Alzheimer’s, so even small gains on this task are notable in people over 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-did-not-change"&gt;What did not change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supplement did not improve chair rise time or other muscle strength measures over 12 weeks. That result held even though everyone received protein and was encouraged to perform simple resistance exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short interventions often struggle to move physical outcomes in older adults. The authors acknowledge the window may have been too brief to remodel muscle while still being long enough to nudge &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/recreational-cannabis-use-protects-against-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These plant fibres, which are cheap and available over the counter, could benefit a wide group of people in these cash strapped times. They are safe and acceptable too,” said Professor Claire Steves, senior author at King’s College London. She added that larger and longer trials are the next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-brain-link-fits-the-data"&gt;Gut-brain link fits the data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut microbes create short chain fatty acids, neurotransmitter precursors, and other metabolites that signal along nerves and through the immune system. Reviews outline how this axis shapes learning and memory, especially as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging itself alters microbial communities and the barriers that keep inflammation in check. Those shifts ripple into brain circuits involved in attention, processing speed, and memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber fermenters like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4908950/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt; thrive on inulin and fructooligosaccharides, producing metabolites tied to synaptic plasticity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That biochemical context helps explain why cognition moved while muscle metrics did not in a 3 month trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-read-these-results"&gt;How to read these results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This RCT used a strong within family control, a clear intervention, and validated cognitive outcomes. It also kept participants engaged through a fully remote setup that reduces travel barriers for older volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the cohort was modest and mostly female, and the findings apply to healthy older adults rather than people with diagnosed dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistics say cognition moved, but the study was not designed to tell us whether daily functioning changed in a measurable way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet, medications, and baseline microbiomes differ from person to person. That reality suggests responses to the same fiber dose may vary, a point future work should tackle with larger samples and longer follow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-this-could-go-next"&gt;Where this could go next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A practical next step is to compare different fiber types, doses, and durations head to head in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also need to test whether early cognitive gains persist at 6 or 12 months and whether they translate into fewer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-molecules-unexpectedly-store-their-own-memory/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; slips in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechanistic work can help map which metabolites rise with supplementation and which brain networks respond. Remote designs, as shown here, make those studies more feasible and inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safe profile and accessibility of these fibers lower the barrier to rigorous testing in community settings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unanswered question is not whether the gut talks to the brain, it is how best to tune that conversation for lasting cognitive benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46116-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 18:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxQU1M2b05Cd3RMay1OOEFXeGtYdjJobFRqZ0ZnR3JmQ25hcTVZemVHWjliRF90UlJabjVMa2dtdEVZWHRCS3VnMXVRZ2RxVzFhRHJIcHc3SGRTUlVPT01VQ2UzaWNjeTBQU0Q5bDBoUGNkSThFLXMxbllWN3o5d2YzZk05dGlfMkd2YmNWbm1KSDhzU3JBdzgyaTg5RkhSZURDOFpodlFwQVRKeWpsX25tWV9tTlFzRXZ1MzNLMjZwVGw0dU9uVGF3</guid></item><item><title>科学家通过抑制大脑蛋白质实现“引人注目”的记忆改善- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/scientists-achieve-striking-memory-improvements-by-suppressing-brain-protein/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00940-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides evidence that a single protein in the brain may play a central role in age-related memory loss—and that suppressing this protein could restore cognitive function in older animals. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco found that increasing levels of a protein called ferritin light chain 1 (Ftl-1) in neurons impairs memory and synaptic function in young mice, while reducing its levels in aged mice rejuvenates brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline is a common feature of aging, even in the absence of disease. Past work has shown that this decline is not primarily caused by neuron death, but rather by changes in how neurons function, especially at their synapses—points of communication between cells that are essential for learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team sought to identify specific molecules that contribute to this decline and could potentially be targeted to reverse it. The hippocampus, a brain region known for its role in memory, is especially vulnerable to aging. The researchers reasoned that if they could uncover the molecular drivers of age-related hippocampal dysfunction, it might open the door to therapeutic interventions for cognitive aging—and perhaps even for age-related diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since I was a kid, I’ve always felt passionate about the brain, and in the last few years I’ve become really excited about aging. Joining Dr. Saul Villeda’s lab at UCSF as a postdoc gave me the chance to connect my two passions—brain and aging—and work on the mechanisms responsible for brain aging,” said Laura Remesal, the lead author of the new study and the founding scientist of Babylon Biosciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study began by examining changes in gene expression in neurons taken from the hippocampi of young and aged mice. Using RNA sequencing, the team identified dozens of genes that were expressed at higher or lower levels with age. When they compared these transcriptional changes with age-related shifts in protein expression, measured by mass spectrometry, one molecule stood out: Ftl-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ftl-1 is a component of ferritin, a protein complex that stores iron in cells. The researchers found that Ftl-1 was elevated in the hippocampal neurons of aged mice and that its expression levels were strongly linked to poorer performance on memory tasks. This correlation suggested that Ftl-1 might be more than just a marker of aging—it could be a contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the team used a virus-based method to increase Ftl-1 expression specifically in the hippocampal neurons of young mice. The consequences were significant. These mice exhibited structural changes in their neurons, including shorter dendrites and fewer synapses—features typically associated with aging. They also performed worse on memory tests, showing little interest in exploring new objects or novel maze arms, in contrast to healthy young controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers reversed course. They used several approaches—short hairpin RNA, CRISPR gene editing, and conditional knockout models—to reduce Ftl-1 levels in the hippocampi of aged mice. Remarkably, this intervention led to improved memory performance. Aged mice with reduced Ftl-1 performed better on tests of recognition and spatial memory, and their hippocampal neurons showed more youthful characteristics, including restored synaptic markers and improved signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The degree of improvement in memory and synaptic measures were striking,” Remesal told PsyPost. “It suggested that changing a single aging-related factor can produce meaningful functional gains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how Ftl-1 affects neuron function, the team looked more closely at cellular processes. They found that Ftl-1 overexpression disrupted the balance between different oxidation states of iron within neurons, increasing the level of oxidized iron. This shift can interfere with mitochondrial function, particularly the cell’s ability to produce ATP, which is critical for energy-intensive processes like maintaining synaptic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, neurons overexpressing Ftl-1 showed diminished ATP production. In contrast, knocking down Ftl-1 enhanced cellular energy output. These results pointed to a link between iron metabolism, mitochondrial health, and brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/psypost-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stay informed with the latest psychology and neuroscience research—sign up for PsyPost’s newsletter and get new discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers wondered if they could counteract the effects of Ftl-1 by supporting mitochondrial function directly. To test this, they gave mice a supplement called NADH, which plays a key role in ATP production during oxidative phosphorylation. In mice that had been genetically altered to overexpress Ftl-1, NADH supplementation improved both neuronal structure and memory performance. These animals, which had previously failed to show a preference for novel objects or maze arms, regained that ability after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the molecular level, NADH appeared to rescue the neurons’ energy metabolism. RNA sequencing of neurons from treated mice revealed increased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis, such as Sdhb, Atp5o, and Ndufa10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings indicate that Ftl-1 contributes to brain aging by disrupting iron homeostasis and energy metabolism, and that both removing this protein and supporting mitochondrial function can restore cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most important takeaway is that cognitive impairment can be reversed, not just prevented or delayed,” Remesal explained. “Treating the aged brain might have more potential than we first thought.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results are promising, the study was conducted entirely in mice. The extent to which these findings will translate to humans remains unknown. Ftl-1, or FTL in humans, performs a conserved role in iron storage, and mutations in the gene have been linked to a rare neurodegenerative disorder known as neuroferritinopathy. Directly targeting FTL in people would require careful evaluation of safety, as altering iron storage could have unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work was done in mice, so I’m wary of drawing hard translational lines to humans,” Remesal said. “Still, the biology is indeed shared between mouse and human and the protein plays the same core role. This gives us confidence that this protein therefore might be a therapeutic target worth pursuing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors are optimistic that their findings provide a foundation for future work. They note that iron dysregulation has already been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. In fact, elevated ferritin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid have been shown to predict cognitive decline over time in people with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also supports a growing body of research suggesting that the aging brain remains plastic—that is, capable of recovering function. Targeting individual molecular pathways, even late in life, might not only slow cognitive decline but partially reverse it. This perspective marks a shift away from the idea that age-related memory loss is inevitable and irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps for the team include investigating whether Ftl-1-targeted therapies can benefit mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases. They are also interested in examining how Ftl-1 is regulated during aging and whether its effects differ across brain regions. Ultimately, they hope to explore whether similar interventions could be developed for human use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00940-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Laura Remesal, Juliana Sucharov-Costa, Yuting Wu, Karishma J.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeuae13t000b3b7af7tor5h6@published"&gt;My in-laws live a four-hour flight away but visit us five to six times a year. They’re both retired and enjoy traveling. My husband and I are parents to their only grandchildren, and they &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; they love spending time with them. But their behavior shows otherwise, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeuag8p100103b7afqim0la2@published"&gt;Their visits typically revolve around concerts, so they have a number of nights out while they stay with us. This is usually fine, but when they decide to see their favorite bands’ multiple east coast tour stops, we feel like our apartment is a convenient, free Airbnb for them. It seems like seeing their grandchildren is not their actual priority. They also don’t really play with the kids; they just like to observe them. My son is about to turn 5 and he’s now questioning why Grandma and Grandpa “only like to look at him.” We had a second child last summer and they similarly like to watch her play. They offer to babysit, but I think it’s mostly so they can say they offered—when we’ve tried to take them up on it, they say they can’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought they were coming for my son’s birthday, but we just found out they plan to leave early in the morning on his birthday, before any of us are awake. My son knows they’re coming but doesn’t know their departure plans yet, and l know he’ll be upset that they won’t actually be here to celebrate with him. We’re both struggling with how to tell our son his grandparents are sneaking away at dawn on his birthday in a way that doesn’t vilify them. We’re pretty annoyed with their travel plans and have voiced our displeasure to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to emphasize that you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have the power to put a stop to their frequent stays—your house is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an Airbnb, however they treat it, and you do not actually have to let them stay with you every time.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="231" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeuae22p000g3b7aoxc9hka4@published"&gt;For all the complaining some people do when their hopes of having grandchildren are dashed, there seem to be plenty of people who just don’t seem terribly interested in the role of grandparent. But there are also people who just aren’t very good at it, sometimes because it’s been a long time since they spent much time with young children. I’m not trying to defend your in-laws, because they do seem to be freely using your house as their free vacation lodging, but if their grandparent failings are compounded by their awkwardness with your son, you (or better yet, your husband) can try to facilitate more interaction next time they come to see you. When my kids were small and spent 90 percent of their day reading, playing games, building towers, serving pretend meals, etc. on the living room floor, our relatives learned they probably needed to be on the kids’ level if they wanted to interact with them. You can be ready to point out your kids’ favorite games and books and crafts etc. to ease everyone into playtime. Yes, this is kind of annoying, but if you do it and it still doesn’t work, at least you’ll know you tried everything you could. Ultimately, it’s up to your in-laws to build a relationship with their grandson; you are not and can’t be responsible for it in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeuae243000h3b7avo2k1hpp@published"&gt;As for what to tell your son about this upcoming visit, I don’t see any benefit to sharing your irritation with him or using language like “sneaking away at dawn.” All you need to say is that Grandma and Grandpa have to go home on his birthday. See if your in-laws can celebrate with him in some way a day or two before, maybe with some pre-birthday cake or ice cream. I hope they at least know enough to bring a gift for him to open.&lt;/p&gt;

I confessed to my husband that I was worried she would hate me like I hate my mother. Let me clarify: I love my mother, but she and I are different in ways that keep us apart and similar in ways that drive us crazy. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/12/becoming-own-mother-parenting-daughter-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;I know this is true for most mother-daughter relationships. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;'Alcohol is a very toxic drug, it not only increases the risk of cancer, especially in women, that's breast cancer, but it also increases the risk of heart disease,' Dr. Levine explained (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Try not to listen above 60 percent of volume,' he warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And, finally, the last two habits he recommended that young people stop were drinking alcohol and participating in recreational drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cocaine or fentanyl is like playing Russian roulette with a loaded gun, with your life,' he warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it's not only cocaine that has the potential to cause damage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Levine states that smoking marijuana can 'reduce cognitive ability,' and can be bad for your lungs and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At number five, alcohol,' he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Alcohol is a very toxic drug, it not only increases the risk of cancer, especially in women, that's breast cancer, but it also increases the risk of heart disease,' Dr. Levine explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's responsible for lots of accidents.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7eme500123b7ai5ao92cq@published"&gt;I’m a 44-year-old man and I’ve been married to a 45-year-old woman for the past 15 years. About six years ago, she told me that she was basically done with sex. While we have had sex maybe 10 times or so since then, her statement has been essentially true. She was never particularly sexual anyway (she never communicated about likes/dislikes, fantasies, masturbation, etc.) and didn’t feel like physical intimacy was important to her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="203" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7emfm00133b7ayrgpz0yk@published"&gt;While I do not feel the same way, I have been, and continue to be, willing to continue our marriage this way. But here is my question: Through recent avid reading of this column, I have learned quite a bit regarding the spectrum of sexuality and have come to strongly believe that my wife is some version of asexual. In retrospect, I think she probably always has been. I don’t think that she spends much time thinking about her own sexuality beyond it being something she can live without. I have started wondering, though, if pushing her to think about it in a bit more self-reflective way and potentially coming to a conclusion/labeling it would be helpful for my own mental health and confidence in the relationship. Even if it is what I already suspect, I can’t help but think that “knowing” it to be true (and to some extent her “admitting” it’s true) would help our relationship.  I am fully aware that this would be entirely for me, as, again, I am nearly positive she does not think about this in any type of self-reflective way. So what do you think? Discuss this with her to ease my own mind, or just maintain the status quo?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7emjx00163b7ak6k3giq2@published"&gt;Given the mores of millennials and Gen Z, it may be unfashionable to hold this opinion, but I believe labels can help everyone. They are shortcuts to understanding human complexity. Granted, they should be used with the tacit understanding that they can be imprecise and certainly do not describe everything (even about the qualities they are highlighting), and thus are often limiting. But in terms of conveying a rough understanding of something like a person’s sexuality, they can be quite useful for orienting not only the labelee but the people around them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7emlg00173b7a8250kko5@published"&gt;Let’s take your situation as an example: Your wife describing herself as asexual would help you understand the reasons behind the dearth of sex in your relationship. It could help you refrain from taking said lack of sex personally, help you not see it as an evaluation of your performance or attractiveness. In other words, it would confirm it’s not you, it’s her. However, since you already suspect that your wife is on the ace spectrum, as it would explain so much, you should ask yourself why confirmation is important to you. Is there, for example, lingering doubt about other potential reasons why your wife is done with sex? Are you just big on formal decrees of one’s personhood? Knowing this about yourself will be useful, as any persistence on your part in attempting to coax out a declaration of your wife’s perceived asexuality will likely prompt the question, “Why do you want to know?”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="159" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7emmy00183b7au5j2oct1@published"&gt;I don’t think there is anything wrong with having a conversation that begins somewhere around, “Do you think you might be asexual?” Even if it is for you, communication, particularly on something as important as your partner’s sexuality, is a good thing. But you should be prepared to receive her where she is. You can’t &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; her dissect parts of herself that she cannot reach or is otherwise not interested in reaching. That is to say: Don’t push her. Have the conversation and see where it goes. If she denies it and you aren’t convinced, you can tell her that and why. Perhaps follow up by purchasing one of the excellent books on asexuality that have been published in the last few years, like Angela Chen’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ace-Asexuality-Reveals-Identity-Meaning-ebook/dp/B07Y7H1WT9/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ATH53V9MSN2K&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kUEjXggB_7ggqNfz6k5l9Ci0fubTz7JypNJkOd07epL0sms16ithw1xQUbZGopKlT3BP7_9S80EiVsbhXyvg-EdTkOgo8lsIoYXN0HxbwRs.4aGk6tzkjd_glgqrbPwJ86MZ_ym1HHMVlAQg9Q6-bH0&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=ace+angela+chen&amp;amp;qid=1756130574&amp;amp;sprefix=ace+angela,aps,183&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ace: What Asexuality Reveals About Desire, Society, and the Meaning of Sex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and/or Cody Daigle-Orians’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Am-Ace-Advice-Living-Asexual/dp/1839972629/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1IM4OFX5HJOHB&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dFHyODVV9BOQqahOJZybQOPJFzdw4W94nMCP5Cv-cdW2ogwqsoWhbmUjr8KSzO4PcODiHjX4EIK06uNlzb453dusb7X-bbIdpQunV2Hdwno.Zdk_QtS6469LzkyC6pjR9m8mpY3NXLOnjYl24qaeNt0&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=cody+daigle-orians&amp;amp;qid=1756130601&amp;amp;sprefix=cody+da,aps,890&amp;amp;sr=8-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Am Ace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu8n6jf002v3b7aryminm8z@published"&gt;My boyfriend has difficulty coming. When it does come out, it doesn’t shoot. It just kind of dribbles for about a minute. He’s only 32 and not experiencing any pain, but I’ve never had any guy I’ve ever been with have this sort of issue. I’ve suggested that he see a urologist, but he waves it off, saying it’s been like this for him for the last three years and he’s fine. Should I insist?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="195" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu8n6jf002y3b7alk2xa204@published"&gt;There are guys who come a lot and those who don’t, and this is often just a matter of general human variance with no bearing on overall health. But here’s what grabbed me in your letter: Your boyfriend saw a change in his overall output some three years ago. Again, it could be nothing, but it’s always best to make sure that any changes we see in the body aren’t the result of an underlying condition. Weak ejaculation (or perceived ejaculate volume reduction) &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/weak-ejaculation#ejaculation-conditions"&gt;may indicate nerve damage&lt;/a&gt; caused by conditions like diabetes or multiple sclerosis. It could be the product of medicine or other factors like stress. Similarly, delayed ejaculation could be the result of &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/delayed-ejaculation/symptoms-causes/syc-20371358"&gt;hormonal conditions or neurological diseases&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes changes like those your boyfriend has observed within himself are benign. Sometimes they amount to our bodies sending us messages. My advice is to always keep your line open for when your body calls with something to say. So yes, I think it would be wise for your boyfriend to see a doctor just in case. It’s much better to rule out something more serious than to be unaware that something grave is afoot.&lt;/p&gt;

But it seems that this &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; bothering him, if his laissez-faire response to you about his dick dribble is any indication. How to make him care? Pointing out that an underlying condition may be at the root of this might inspire action on his part. But ultimately, you can’t make him care about anything. That’s on him. Hopefully, inspiration will kick in well before an actual issue presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu8n6jh00343b7apk9ae6gt@published"&gt;This is a pretty simple case of cause and effect.  Part of what inspired your husband to seek out testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) was his low sex drive. And TRT delivered his sex drive, as it’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5649360/"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37589949/"&gt;do&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu8n6jh00353b7alam3cqrg@published"&gt;Unless his sex drive becomes so distracting that it impacts his obligations/daily life, I don’t think this is much of a problem. Swing by when you can, but otherwise, leave him to his own devices, of which he now owns several. It seems like he’s doing what he needs to do with his libido boost. If he is unsatisfied with the results, he should talk to his doctor. But something tells me that he’s currently thrilled enough for both of you.&lt;/p&gt;

It can correct the changes in the cornea that cause nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. For those looking to ditch glasses or contact lenses, LASIK has become a common solution: since its approval in 1999 this surgery has treated &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7982707/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7982707/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more than 10 million people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="6967e060-cde2-4a5a-9e95-6888d1999550"&gt;The cornea bends light to focus it on the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, before the visual information is sent to the brain to be processed. Irregularly shaped corneas don't focus light properly, resulting in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/corneal-conditions/corneal-dystrophies" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/corneal-conditions/corneal-dystrophies" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;impaired vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Many collagen-containing tissues in the body, including the cornea, are held in place by oppositely charged components attracted to each other like magnets. These tissues also contain water, so &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.2c01177" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.2c01177" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;zapping the tissues with electricity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ultimately lowers their pH, making them more acidic. With the pH altered, the attraction between opposite charged components is unlocked, loosening up the tissue and making it moldable. When scientists then cut the electricity and restore the tissue's original pH, it locks back into the new shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KcWhG2CbARbXbWu3UBeyAm" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KcWhG2CbARbXbWu3UBeyAm slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill and Wong wondered whether EMR could be used to reshape the cornea. To see, they ran tests with rabbit eyes in lab dishes. They created a platinum contact lens template to imitate the corrected shape of a cornea, placed it over a rabbit eyeball in saline solution, and sent an electric current through the platinum lens. Within about a minute, the rabbit eyeball's cornea molded around the contact lens; the whole process took about the same time as LASIK surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="95524a28-2ceb-41cb-bee9-bcc712e0981c"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;EMR flattened this rabbit cornea, shown in a cross section, from its original shape (white line) to a corrected one (yellow line). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Daniel Kim and Mimi Chen)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="621061ec-e124-4c99-8d93-223eb3ccd8a3"&gt;The researchers tested this method on 12 rabbit eyeballs, 10 of which were treated as if they had myopia, or nearsightedness. The treatment successfully reshaped the cornea in a way that would better focus light on the retina, and the cells in the eyeballs were not damaged in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method might also be able to reverse cloudiness in the cornea, Hill and Wong told Live Science, which is currently only treatable through a corneal transplant. That's something they're still experimenting with, but in theory, tweaking the pH of the cornea could also help counter the cloudiness, they think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Hill and Wong are hopeful about the promise of EMR eye treatments, this procedure is in very early stages, they said. The next steps are studies in living animals, and more specific tests to assess which specific vision issues this process can correct, like near- and farsightedness and astigmatism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like any other medical technology it's a process, and you have to go through a fair amount of testing," Wong told Live Science. This includes testing more with animal tissues and with live animals, resolving any issues that arise, and eventually moving on to various phases of clinical trials in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These early preclinical tests of the method are promising in that they show the procedure is safe for eye cells and that the cornea remains clear after EMR alteration, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.opt.uh.edu/profiles/maria-walker/index.cfm" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.opt.uh.edu/profiles/maria-walker/index.cfm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Maria Walker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an optometrist at the University of Houston, told Live Science. But further testing would need to investigate possible longer-term effects. "It might be safe and the cornea might be clear, but then what happens in a month?" said Walker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some issues with laser eye surgery, although rare, come from heat transfer to the cornea, which EMR techniques would avoid, Walker noted. "My impression is cautiously optimistic," she said. "I think it's promising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ae3c7193-5e62-4841-9f56-cf5ae9904e84"&gt;If the method is proven to be successful and safe in humans, it could someday offer an alternative or complement to LASIK that's possibly reversible — since it's not actually removing any tissue, just rearranging it — and cheaper, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't treat every single problem of the cornea with LASIK, there are areas where it simply doesn't have application," said Wong. There are certain patients who &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/lasik/when-lasik-not-me" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/lasik/when-lasik-not-me" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;aren't good candidates for LASIK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "So I think there are areas where this would have value complementing LASIK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of EMR equipment would also be cheaper than laser equipment, said Wong, which could potentially make it accessible to more patients looking to correct their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-KcWhG2CbARbXbWu3UBeyAm-iItIwUSvo7j1JLcG1rY2hBoW9JS3thVp" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-KcWhG2CbARbXbWu3UBeyAm-iItIwUSvo7j1JLcG1rY2hBoW9JS3thVp slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the study of 100 adults between the ages of 35 and 50, who had run five or more marathons or two or more ultramarathons, Cannon found 15% of the participants had advanced adenomas, which are precancerous lesions, compared to the expected 1% to 2% in non-runners in this age range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, 41% had at least one adenoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The normal risk in the 35 to 50 population would be one-fifth of those numbers,” Cannon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average age of the participants was 42.5 year old — two and half years before the recommended age of 45, for a first screening colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reason we all get colonoscopies, or we should all get colonoscopies, when we turn 45, is because if we remove a polyp or adenoma before it becomes cancerous, then we’re likely going to be safe from cancer,” Cannon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An often-ignored warning sign for endurance athletes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon said long distance runners, and many of their physicians, have downplayed bleeding after a run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very common among long distance runners, and it’s often been called ‘runner’s colitis,'” Cannon said. “The slang is ‘runners’ trots.'”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People have assumed that ‘runner’s colitis’ is a benign entity, so they’ve been saying ‘It’s normal for runners to bleed.’ And the reason I know this, is because that’s what these runners who have cancer are telling me,” Cannon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon said blood in the stool, for runners or any person, should be checked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most common presenting symptom for someone with colon cancer is blood in their stool,” Cannon said. “That’s the most common reason we learn someone has polyps or cancer is because they’re bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon said further research is underway, in examining this possible link. However, there could be other reasons extreme endurance athletes seem at risk of developing colon cancer at younger age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It could be the runners’ diets. It could be other aspects of their lifestyle that they have in common. It could be they drink from bottles with BPA or some other carcinogen more often than regular people,” who don’t engage in similar long-distance activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Cannon hopes that this preliminary study will prompt runners to get screening colonoscopies before the age of 45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do think that it should raise awareness that any bleeding from a runner is a reason get a colonoscopy,  and not something to be ignored,” Cannon said. “Exercise is good, overall — please don’t use this as an excuse not to exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;

Cottage cheese with fruit is the answer. Cottage cheese is creamy and satisfying all on its own, bu&lt;strong&gt;t pairing it with fruit adds fiber, nutrients and a touch of natural sweetness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, cottage cheese’s mild, slightly tangy flavor complements all kinds of fruit — from juicy stone-fruits to crisp apples to sweet tropical varieties. With endless options, you can keep it seasonal or simply follow your cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the health benefits of cottage cheese?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/328841/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;, just ⅔ cup of 2% cottage cheese serves up 151 mg of calcium (about 15% of the average adult's &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/calcium.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:daily calcium needs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;daily calcium needs&lt;/a&gt; between age 19 and 50) and a solid 16 grams of protein. The result? A nutrient-dense win for both bones and muscles. It’s also rich in &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Phosphorus-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:phosphorus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;phosphorus&lt;/a&gt;, an essential mineral that supports strong, healthy bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Protein is a macronutrient that can be tricky to get enough of since it often requires planning and cooking,” explains &lt;a href="https://amydavisrd.com/recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amy Davis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amy Davis&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, a New Orleans-based dietitian. “Cottage cheese is an easy way to add it to your diet.

Plus, it’s naturally high in &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:selenium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;selenium&lt;/a&gt;, an antioxidant and thyroid-supportive mineral.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cottage cheese is a protein powerhouse on its own, but adding fruit makes it a well-rounded snack, meal, or even a dessert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pineapple&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you love a sweet-and-savory combo, pineapple and cottage cheese is a must-try.

If you’re sensitive to dairy, combining it with pineapple may make for an easier-to-digest snack.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh or frozen pineapple are both great options. If you’re using canned, just drain and rinse it first to cut back on added sugar — or better yet, go with an option that’s packed in its own juice instead of syrup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a64746355/nutritious-food-combos/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 Top Food Pairings to Supercharge Your Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;10 Top Food Pairings to Supercharge Your Health &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Petru Blaga / 500px - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Berries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries bring more than just a pop of color to your bowl of cottage cheese.

Better yet, mix them all together for a nutrient-packed combo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;IndigoBetta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Apple&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crisp, sweet and loaded with fiber, vitamin C and antioxidants, apples have more than earned their “keep the doctor away” reputation.

On top of that, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321083/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research highlights;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research highlights&lt;/a&gt; apples’ benefits for everything from reducing inflammation to supporting heart health and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of varieties to choose from, from tart Granny Smiths to juicy Galas. Toss in chunks or slices with your cottage cheese for a fresh, nutrient-packed breakfast that’s as satisfying as it is healthy. For an extra touch, sprinkle with cinnamon or drizzle a bit of maple syrup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Anastasia Hordina - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Peach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juicy, in-season peaches are a perfect match for the mild saltiness of cottage cheese.

Try pairing it with kiwi, suggests Davis. “The tiny seeds add a light crunch that balances out the creaminess and for even more texture, you can sprinkle on some granola,” she says. “Kiwi is one of the most underrated fruits. It’s a vitamin C powerhouse — just two give you &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6267416/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:100% of your daily needs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;100% of your daily needs&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s high in fiber. It’s a really unique, refreshing pairing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To pick a ripe kiwi, look for one that’s slightly soft to the touch. If the hard nub at the end comes off easily with your fingers, it’s ready; if you need a knife, it’s not quite there yet. For extra fiber, Davis also recommends keeping the skin on — just rinse and scrub well before eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/g64815628/fruits-high-in-magnesium/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:9 Fruits That Are High In Magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;9 Fruits That Are High In Magnesium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Magda Tymczyj - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mango&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mango is another sweet, juicy tropical favorite that pairs well with mild, creamy cottage cheese. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2710833/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Loaded with immune-boosting vitamins and minerals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Loaded with immune-boosting vitamins and minerals&lt;/a&gt; like vitamin A, vitamin C, folate, potassium, copper, and magnesium, it’s as healthy as it is delicious.

Mabashov points out that this combo is not only flavorful, but also packed with benefits — including helping to balance blood sugar and keep you full longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pairing cottage cheese with pear creates a steady rise in blood sugar, avoiding the quick spike-and-crash you’d get from fruit alone,” she explains. “Both foods also support gut health.

Choosing organic helps cut down on exposure to synthetic pesticides and added hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Look for simple ingredients like milk, cream, salt and live cultures, which are great for gut health. Steer clear of additives and artificial flavors, which don’t add any real nutrition and can sometimes upset your stomach,” says Mabashov. “Also, check the protein and aim for at least 12 to 14 grams per half cup.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to fat content, it’s really a personal choice that depends on your dietary requirements and goals. “Full-fat (4%) can be more satiating, contain more fat-soluble vitamins and keep blood sugar stable, whereas low-fat (2%) can be a good balance of creaminess and lighter calories,” explains Mabashov. “Fat-free often tastes chalky and may have extra stabilizers to make up for the texture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind: Cottage cheese is naturally higher in sodium. If you’re watching your heart health or blood pressure, look for lower sodium options — Mabashov recommends aiming for less than 300 milligrams of sodium per half cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Westend61&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 16:32:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE10N1V1UGxBQXlIaE1nbHhDd0ZMN2UwbjV1M2djZVFuZjlkXzZPeDl0ZFZLcTVPejh1NTJtdG4ydFBEMW4wNlVhUWRBZm1uUnFJLVlrUVMtVmJobWt6NFNFSTZ3WE1JWkptOU9CXzhxMnRhdk1VNkNuTVRB</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现，您的年度眼科检查可以发现早期阿尔茨海默氏症- bestlifeonline.com</title><link>https://bestlifeonline.com/eye-exam-could-detect-alzheimers/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content noskimwords"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Did you know that 94 percent of people with &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/vision-problems-alzheimers-news/"&gt;posterior cortical atrophy&lt;/a&gt; (PCA) problems develop Alzheimer’s disease? While the condition is rare, the link between ocular changes and cognitive decline isn’t. Previous studies have examined the impact of retinal vascular health on brain function—which supports theories that the eyes are a gateway to better understanding the brain. And now, scientists say a routine eye exam could detect signs of early Alzheimer’s before the onset of typical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Your eye health can say a lot about your brain health.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-mob-square-fixed first_ad karma_unit inline hide-desktop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in the shape and size of your retinal blood vessels can indicate the presence of early Alzheimer’s, according to a new study published in the journal &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia: Retinal vascular dysfunction in the Mthfr677C&amp;gt;T mouse model of cerebrovascular disease" href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70501" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because the retina is an extension of the central nervous system—meaning, it shares “essentially the same tissue” as the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your retina is essentially your brain, but it’s much more accessible because your pupil is just a hole, and we can see tons of stuff,” co-lead study author &lt;strong&gt;Alaina Reagan&lt;/strong&gt;, PhD, a neuroscientist at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), explained in a &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1095908" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “All the cells are very similar, all the neurons are quite similar, all the immune cells are quite similar, and they behave similarly under pressure if you’ve got a disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this to say, your annual eye exam could also, potentially, serve as a brain health checkup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re at an optometrist or ophthalmologist appointment, and they can see odd vascular changes in your retina, that could potentially represent something that is also happening in your brain, which could be very informative for early diagnostics,” noted Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/ppis-dementia-risk/"&gt;Doctors Warn This Common Medication May Be Linked to Dementia Risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retinal vessels that look narrow or swollen could be an early sign of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers looked at mice with the common genetic mutation “MTHFR677C&amp;gt;TTK,” which is a known Alzheimer’s risk variant. (The study also states that MTHFR677C&amp;gt;TTK occurs in up to 40 percent of humans.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They conducted a traditional eye exam and found abnormalities in the blood vessels and arteries of the mice. More specifically, the retinas appeared to have “twisted vessels, narrowed and swollen arteries, and less vessel branching.” These changes were detected in young mice starting at six months old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twisted vessels “can result in turbulent blood flow, which promotes changes in blood pressure, degradation of elastin, and luminal shear stress,” wrote the authors. Additionally, it could be an underlying symptom of “poor blood flow and increased risk of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can see these wavy vessels in the retinas, which can occur in people with dementia,” Reagan said. “That speaks to a more systemic problem, not just a brain- or retina-specific problem. It could be a blood pressure problem affecting everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more is that female mice displayed worse eye health than their male peers. At one year old, they had “reduced vessel density and branching,” which the authors labeled as “progressive.” This corroborates a statistic from the Alzheimer’s Society that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/why-dementia-different-women" target="_blank"&gt;women have an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing Alzheimer’s in their lifetime, compared to men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Reagan, the study’s findings suggest “these systems in brain and retinal tissue are working in tandem.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The takeaway:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists say unusual changes in retinal blood vessels could serve as an early warning sign for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people over 50 have some kind of vision impairment and get checked annually for prescription changes,” said Reagan. “Are they more at risk if they have these vascular changes, and is that a point when doctors could start mitigating brain changes? That could be 20 years before cognitive damage becomes noticeable to patients and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the research team is partnering with dementia care experts from Maine’s Northern Light Acadia Hospital to study the correlation between mutation MTHFR677C&amp;gt;TTK and vascular changes in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled (21–22 °C), humidity-controlled (51%) and light-controlled (12 h–12 h light–dark cycle; lights on, 06:00; lights off, at 18:00) room. Food and water were given ad libitum. After arrival at the facility, the mice were allowed a minimum of 1 week to adapt to the housing environment before surgeries were performed. All of the experiments were conducted according to the standards set by the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the institutional guidelines of the University of Southern California (USC) and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male MORF3 mice (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20; aged 2 months), were also used for neuroanatomical tract tracing. The MORF3 mouse line (C57BL/6-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm3(CAG-sfGFP*)Xwy/J), generated by X. W. Yang’s laboratory at UCLA&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Veldman, M.

MORF3 mice express a Cre-dependent tandem ‘spaghetti monster’ fluorescent protein with 20 V5 epitopes (smFP-V5) preceded by a polycytosine repeat (C22) MORF switch under the control of a CAG promoter. Cre recombination combined with a spontaneous frameshift results in sparse and stochastic labelling of neural cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other transgenic mouse lines, including VGLUT2 Cre (B6J.129S6(FVB)-Slc17a6tm2(cre)Lowl/MwarJ) and CRH-Cre (B6(Cg)-Crhtm1(cre)Zjh/J) were purchased from JAX and breeding colonies for these mouse lines were established at UCLA. CRH-Cre mice were crossed with Ai14 mice to generate CRH-Cre Ai14 mice for some of the experiments. A total of 5 male VGLUT2 Cre, 5 CRH-Cre and 4 CRH-Cre Ai14 mice aged 2 months were used for the neuroanatomic tracing experiments. Animal information for non-tracing studies is included in their corresponding subsections below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sample sizes for each of the tracing and morphology experiments were chosen based on previous experience. Randomization was not performed for the neural tracing experiments as animals were not assigned to different groups. Randomization is necessary for reducing bias and controlling variability. Instead, the data were validated in different ways (see the ‘Data reproducibility’ section). Randomization was also not necessary for morphology experiments. Owing to the characteristics of MORF3, we achieve random labelling of neurons and then reconstruct the traceable neurons. For neuroanatomic tracing and morphology experiments, blinding also was not necessary because the animals were not assigned to different groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Ethics statement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are committed to promoting ethical research practices and ensuring the welfare of all animals involved in our studies. All procedures adhered to regulatory standards as delineated in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, as well as institutional guidelines set forth by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of Southern California (USC) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Tracers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL; 2.5%; Vector Laboratories) was used as the main chemical anterograde tracer. Chemical retrograde tracers included cholera toxin subunit b (CTB Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate, 0.25%; Invitrogen) and FG (1%; Fluorochrome). FG was also injected through the tail vein (2%, 30 μl) to label neuroendocrine cells. Each anterograde and retrograde tracer has distinct characteristics and exhibits varied neurotropism that can meaningfully affect connectivity results. For example, anterograde AAVs label fibres of passage, while PHAL does not. These differences underscore the importance of data validation. In this work, the connectivity data were validated in multiple ways to ensure the reliability of the results. Retrograde tracers were placed in regions of anterograde terminations, while anterograde tracers were placed in regions of retrogradely labelled cells. For example, Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09360-w#Fig16"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; shows retrograde tracer injection in the DPs and DPd that reveal their distinct brain-wide inputs (brain-wide ROIs to the DPs or DPd).

Moreover, the potential for cytotoxicity within the starter cell population may provide an opportunity for rabies to non-specifically spread to nearby synapses rather than through those specifically contacting starter cells. To control for these possibilities, retrograde tracing results must be validated using complementary anterograde approaches, such as by tracing axonal connections from the upstream region, or by optogenetically stimulating upstream axons and recording synaptic responses in the target cell population.

On the day of the experiment, mice were deeply anaesthetized and mounted into a Kopf stereotaxic apparatus where they were maintained under isoflurane gas anaesthesia (Datex-Ohmeda vaporizer). Before the surgery, mice were given one subcutaneous injection of Ketoprofen (4 mg per kg) and a protective ophthalmic ointment was applied to their eyes. For single anterograde tracer injection experiments (PHAL or AAV), tracers were iontophoretically delivered through glass micropipettes (inner tip diameter, 24–32 μm) using alternating 7 s on–7 s off pulsed positive electrical current (Stoelting, current source) for 10 min, and AAVs were delivered through the same method for 2 min (inner tip diameter, 8–12 μm). For anterograde/retrograde co-injection experiments (PHAL/CTB-647 and AAV/FG), tracer cocktail iontophoretic injections were made through glass micropipettes (inner tip diameter, 28–32 μm) for 10 min (PHAL/CTB-647) or 5 min (AAV/FG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For multiple retrograde tracing experiments, at each injection site, 50 nl of the retrograde tracer was individually pressure-injected through glass micropipettes at a rate of 10 nl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (Drummond Nanoject III).

In brief, AAVretro-Cre was injected into a downstream projection target of DP (for example, ACA), and Cre-dependent TVA- and RG-expressing helper virus (AAV8-hSyn-FLEX-TVA-P2A-GFP-2A-oG) and mCherry-expressing G-deleted rabies virus (produced by the laboratory of I. Wickersham) were injected into the DP to label the DP projection neurons population (first order) and their brain-wide monosynaptic inputs (second order). The same strategy also was applied to trace brain structures that generate monosynaptic inputs to the DP-projecting neurons in the RE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a modified rabies tracing strategy to identify monosynaptic inputs from the DPd to CRH-expressing neuroendocrine neurons in the PVH. In CRH-Cre transgenic mice, a Cre-dependent helper virus (AAV8-hSyn-FLEX-TVA-P2A-GFP-2A-oG) was injected into the PVH to drive expression of TVA and rabies glycoprotein (RG), followed by injection of mCherry-expressing &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;-deleted rabies virus (RbV-ΔG-mCherry). This approach selectively labels neurons providing direct monosynaptic input to CRH neurons.

W., Tao, H. W. &amp;amp; Zhang, L. I. Application of AAV1 for anterograde transsynaptic circuit mapping and input-dependent neuronal cataloging. Curr. Protoc. 2, e339 (2022)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09360-w#ref-CR61" id="ref-link-section-d108237404e3356"&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In brief, anaesthetized mice were iontophoretically injected with Cre-dependent AAV-FLEX-RFP or GFP in the target structures (for example, the LHA), and pressure injected (20–80 nl) with AAV1-Cre in an upstream structure (for example, the DP). The AAV1-Cre is transported anterogradely down the axons and is released from the terminals, where it transfects postsynaptic cells that have been infected with high concentrations of Cre-dependent AAV-FLEX-RFP. The scant Cre expression is sufficient to unlock strong fluorophore expression in the downstream neurons, therefore revealing their axonal projections and terminals. After a 3-week post-operative recovery, the mice were anaesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused. The Cre injection site was verified by staining with mouse anti-Cre recombinase monoclonal primary antibody (see the ‘Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry’ section for details). One caveat to using AAV1-Cre is that the virus can also travel retrogradely and should be used in situations in which the connection is known to be primarily unidirectional. In all of the experiments in which AAV1-Cre was used in the current paper, the connections were shown to be predominantly unidirectional (BLA/SUBv/AUDv to DP and DP to CEA/LHA/PAG; Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09360-w#MOESM1"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;). As an example, we injected AAV1-Cre into the DP and a Cre-dependent AAV into the LHA to show that LHA neurons that receive input from the DP project to the spinal cord (DP to LHA to spinal cord). If LHA projected back to the DP, we would possibly be showing that LHA neurons that project to DP also project to the spinal cord. However, we know that the DP to LHA connection is unidirectional (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09360-w#MOESM1"&gt;11b&lt;/a&gt;), which lends reasonable confidence to our conclusion of DP to LHA to spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details regarding how injection site locations were accurately determined are provided in the ‘Injection Site Analysis’ section of the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09360-w#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Data reproducibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reported connections underwent validation through at least one of the following methods. Injections targeting different regions were repeated to evaluate consistency of labels. The Cre-dependent anterograde and TVA receptor mediated rabies tracing also validated the connections. Furthermore, retrograde tracers were introduced into regions displaying anterograde terminal labelling to confirm anterograde connections, whereas anterograde tracers were administered into the sites of retrogradely-labelled projection cells to validate retrograde injection data. In some instances, channelrhodopsin assisted circuit mapping also validated connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec31"&gt;Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals were euthanized with an overdose injection of sodium pentobarbital (6 mg per kg) 7 days (chemical tracers) or 14 days (viral tracers) after surgeries. Each animal was transcardially perfused with approximately 50 ml of 0.9% NaCl followed by 50 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde solution (PFA; pH 9.5). The brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24–48 h at 4 °C, after which they were embedded in 3% type I-B agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) before sectioning. Four series of coronal sections were sliced at a thickness of 50 µm using a Compresstome (VF-700, Precisionary Instruments) and prepared for processing. One of the four-section series was immunostained for imaging. The series that contained coronal level 53 of the Allen Reference Atlas was selected to maintain similar section-level distributions across experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following primary antibodies were used across the studies: rabbit anti-PHAL (1:1,000; Vector Laboratories, AS-2300), rabbit anti-fluorogold antibody (1:5,000; Millipore-Sigma, AB153-I), mouse anti-Cre recombinase (1:4,000; EMD Millipore, MAB3120), rat monoclonal FOS antibody (1:1,000; Synaptic Systems, 226017), mouse anti-oxytocin antibody (4G11, 1:5,000; Millipore-Sigma, MAB5296), rabbit anti-vasopressin antibody (1:5,000, Millipore-Sigma, AB1565), rabbit-anti somatostatin antibody (1:500, Millipore-Sigma, SAB4502861) and streptavidin for biocytin-labelled recorded neurons (1:1.000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, S21374).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In brief, sections were transferred to a blocking solution containing normal donkey serum (Vector Laboratories) and Triton X-100 (VWR) for 1 h. After three 5-min rinses, the sections were incubated in a KPBS solution comprising donkey serum, Triton X-100 and a primary antibody at the appropriate dilution (the concentration for each primary antibody is described above) for 48–72 h at 4 °C (Vector Laboratories, AS-2300). The sections were rinsed three times in KPBS and then soaked for 3 h in the secondary antibody solution, which contained donkey serum, Triton X-100 and the corresponding secondary antibody solution at the appropriate dilution (1:500 for anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488, 555 or 647; Invitrogen, A-21206 (488), A-31573 (647); anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 647: Life Technology: A-21202 (488) and A-31571 (647); anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647: Jackson ImmunoResearch, 715-605-150). The sections were again rinsed with KPBS three times. All selected section series were counterstained with a fluorescent Nissl stain, NeuroTrace 435/455 (NT, 1:500, Invitrogen, N21479). The sections were then mounted and coverslipped using 65% glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec32"&gt;RNAscope experiments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deeply anaesthetized animals were perfused and brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight followed by sequential immersion in 15% and 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. The brains were then sectioned (20 µm) and the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent v2 assay was performed according to the manual provided by Advanced Cell Diagnostics. In brief, slides containing tissue sections were post-fixed in the prechilled 4% PFA for 15 min at 4 °C, and then dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions 50%, 70% and 100% for 5 min at room temperature. Hydrogen peroxide was applied to each section for 10 min at room temperature, and target retrieval was then performed at 99 °C for 5 min. Protease III was then added to the samples and incubated in a HybEZ oven for 30 min at 40 °C. The subsequent RNAscope assay was composed by multiple steps of hybridization (probe and AMP binding) and signal development (HRP channel binding), each followed by washing the slides in 1× wash buffer as described in the manufacturer’s protocol (Multiplex fluorescent v2 kit). Opal fluorophores (Akoya Biosciences) were diluted at 1:1,500 to visualize RNA signals. After the RNAscope assay, the sections were counterstained with DAPI (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, D1306) and mounted. Images were acquired using a Dragonfly High Speed Confocal Microscope System (Andor). The following probes were used in this study: &lt;i&gt;Cux2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Etv1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tle4&lt;/i&gt;, SS, CRH, and TRH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec33"&gt;Image acquisition and 2D processing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 50-µm sections were scanned as high-resolution virtual slide image (VSI) files using the Olympus VS120 high-throughput microscope. Post-acquisition processing methods, including image registration, tracer segmentation and quantification, are described in detail below. In brief, all images were flipped to ensure that the injection site and its corresponding ipsilateral labelling were in the correct right hemisphere. This was performed using the VS-Desktop software that accompanies the microscope. Images were then imported into Outspector—our custom software for image processing (see the ‘Outspector: our proprietary 2D image processing pipeline’ section of the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09360-w#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Methods&lt;/a&gt;) and processed on a high-performance computing cluster. A first-pass fully automatic registration was executed and subsequently its results were inspected and fine-tuned when needed. Tracer segmentation was performed on registered images with the default parameters. Segmentation results were also inspected, followed by interactive parameter adjustments if needed. Segmented pixel counts and cell counts in each brain region at all section levels were generated and used for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec34"&gt;Outspector&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outspector is our informatics workflow specifically designed to reliably warp, reconstruct, annotate and analyse the labelled pathways in a high-throughput manner. Tissue sections from each analysed case were assigned and registered to standard templates of the corresponding ARA levels. All images shown in this Article are from the raw data of unwarped, unregistered VSI images. Threshold parameters were individually adjusted for each case and tracer. Adobe Photoshop was used to correct conspicuous artifacts in the threshold output files. Each colour channel was brightness/contrast adjusted to maximize labelling visibility (Nissl Neurotrace 435/455 is converted to bright field), and TIFF images are then converted to JPEG file format. The detailed calculations used for all Outspector processing steps and analysis are provided in the ‘Outspector: our proprietary 2D image processing pipeline’ section of the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09360-w#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Methods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;Quantifying colocalization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using spots function on Imaris, thresholds were set to select most positive cells for each channel (405, 488, 561 and 642). After automatic detection, manual quality control was necessary. The spatial relationship between DAPI in 405 and RNA puncta for &lt;i&gt;Fezf2&lt;/i&gt; was used as a visual aid to correct false negatives and remove false-positive spots from the automatic detection. Each channel was quality controlled multiple times to ensure accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;Tissue processing and imaging for 3D single-neuron labelling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To elucidate the finely detailed morphology of DP neurons, we injected with either AAV-retro Cre or AAV1-Cre into MORF3 mice. Then, 3–4 weeks after the injections, the mice were perfused. Immunostaining with the V5 antibody allows the visualization of the finely detailed neuronal morphology of these MORF3 neurons. This approach enabled us to image, reconstruct and analyse the cell-type-specific morphological features of DP cortical projection neurons. Following the same strategy, we also revealed sparsely labelled neurons with finely detailed dendritic morphology in the LHA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SHIELD clearing protocol was used for the 3D tissue processing&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 62" title="Park, Y.

Brains were processed using the SmartClear and SmartLabel machines (LifeCavas SmartBatch). Whole brains were imaged using the Life Canvas SmartSPIM lightsheet microscope at ×15 (0.42 μm × 0.42μm × 0.42 μm). Three lasers (488, 555, 647 nm) were used, respectively, to image Syp–eGFP axonal terminals, tdTomato-positive cortical neurons and their axons and MORF3-positive postsynaptic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For acquiring images on thick sections, the whole brain was cut into 500 µm sections and were cleared in the SDS buffer at 37 °C for 72 h. The sections were then washed three times with KPBS and incubated in KPBS at 4 °C for 24 h. The sections were mounted and cover-slipped onto 25 × 75 × 1 mm glass slides with an index matching solution (100%, EasyIndex, LifeCanvas Technologies, EI-Z1001). The sections were imaged with a high-speed spinning-disk confocal microscope (Andor Dragonfly 202 Imaging System, Andor, Oxford Instruments Company, CR-DFLY-202-2540). ×10 magnification (NA 0.40, Olympus, UPLXAPO10X) was used to acquire an overview, after which ×30 magnification (Olympus, UPLSAPO30xSIR, NA 1.05, W.D.: 0.80 mm) at 1 µm &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; steps or ×60 magnification (Olympus, UPLASAPO60XS2, NA 1.30, W.D.: 0.30 mm) were used to acquire high-resolution images for fine-detailed dendritic morphology and putative synaptic connections. The sections were imaged with four excitation wavelengths: 405 nm (blue Nissl background), 488 nm (for AAV-GFP) and 647 nm (far red for MORF3) with respective emission detection wavelengths of 450 nm, 525 nm and 600 nm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec37"&gt;3D reconstructions, visualizations and analysis of neuronal morphology&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manual reconstruction of neurons was performed using Vaa3D&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 64" title="Peng, H., Bria, A., Zhou, Z., Iannello, G. &amp;amp; Long, F.

Specifically, analysis scripts measured all neurons across a series of parameters including total dendritic wiring length, number of branches, average branch angle, average root angle, branch asymmetry, average branch order, average Strahler order and the distance from the midline. The coefficients of variances across the parameters were then measured, followed by classification using &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-means clustering. The size and complexity of dendritic arbours, defined by total dendritic length and the total number of branches, emerged as the most varied. We then classified all of the neurons, first based on dendritic arbour size and complexity, followed by superficial versus deep-layer classification based on the distance of all cell bodies from the midline. Both classifications created two neuronal clusters each. The superficial versus deep-layer neurons were then compared for size, complexity and dendritic orientation. Similarly, the two morphological clusters (small-simple and large-complex) were compared for their distance from midline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec38"&gt;Statistical analyses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These comparisons were made using one-tailed nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests.

Sample sizes were chosen on the basis of previous experience. Randomization and blinding were not performed as the mice were not assigned to different groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after channelrhodopsin and tracer injections, acute brain slices were prepared for electrophysiological recordings. After anaesthesia with isoflurane, the mouse was decapitated and the brain was rapidly removed and immersed in ice-cold high sucrose slice solution: 208 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 26 mM NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.3 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 8 mM MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and 10 mM glucose; saturated with 95% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; pH 7.4. Brain slices (thickness, 350 μm) were cut in the coronal plane using a vibrating microtome (Leica, VT1000S). Slices were allowed to recover for at least 30 min in a submersion chamber filled with warmed (32–34 °C) ACSF containing 130 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 26 mM NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 2 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 2 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 10 mM glucose, oxygenated with 95% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, pH 7.2–7.4, 290–310 mOsm, and then cooled gradually to room temperature until recording. The presence of RFP and ChR2 (YFP) labelling was determined with green and blue fluorescence excitation, respectively, in the slices before recording. Patch pipettes with about 3–4 MΩ impedance were used for whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Glass pipettes contained a Cs-methanesulfonate-based internal solution with the following salt concentrations: 130 mM Cs-methanesulfonate, 10 mM CsCl, 4 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 5 mM mM 150 mM MgATP, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM GTP, 10 mM phosphocreatine and 0.1 mM leupeptin (pH 7.2 with 151 CsOH, 270 mOsm) and biocytin (0.2%). For isolation and recording of monosynaptic responses to blue-light stimulation, tetrodotoxin (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blocker, 1 μM) and 4-aminopyridine (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blocker, 100 μM) were added to the external solution. Signals were recorded from red-labelled neurons with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) running pClamp software (v.10.5) under voltage clamp mode at a holding voltage of −70 mV for excitatory currents, filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Blue light (470 nm) stimulation was delivered using a 0.5 ms pulse at ~1 mW power for 5 trials, delivered through a LED (CoolLED). Signals were analysed using Clampfit (v.10.5). For responding neurons, peak responses were averaged across trials (technical replicate). The averaged value of each cell was then combined with the other cells for each experiment to calculate the mean, median, s.d. and so on (biological replicate). To demonstrate that light-evoked synaptic responses were indeed excitatory, the selective glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX (20 µM) for AMPA receptors and APV (50 µM) for NMDA receptors were added to the bathing solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After recording, the slices were fixed with PFA and then transferred to PBS for biocytin staining to reveal and validate the location of the recorded neurons. The biocytin staining also revealed the morphology of the recorded DP or PVH neurons (see the ‘Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry’ section for details).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec40"&gt;Statistical analyses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare the median peak amplitude of currents evoked by optogenetic stimulation of AUDv to DP neurons receiving either ENTl or PIR input, nonparametric Mann–Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;-tests were used and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value adjustments were not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec41"&gt;Optogenetic stimulation and measurements of plasma CORT hormone&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 15 mice (male C57BL/6, aged 2 months) were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. Sample sizes for each of the experiments were chosen based on our previous experience and, based on the results, sufficient power was achieved to detect significant differences. Each of the animals received bilateral injections of AAV1-Cre into the SUBv and the BLAa, allowing Cre to anterogradely transport to and trans-synaptically label DP neurons. The animals also received a bilateral injection of Cre-dependent AAV-FLEX-ChR2 (30 nl) into the DP. Consequently, only DP neurons postsynaptic to the SUBv and BLAa express ChR2 and generate projections to the hypothalamic neuroendocrine zone, including the PVH. Optic fibres (200 μm core diameter, 0.37 numerical aperture; Inper) were implanted above the injection site at a depth of −1.6 mm ventral to the bregma skull surface and secured to the skull using super glue and dental cement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The optogenetic stimulation was performed 7–8 weeks after the surgery. Before testing, the mice were individually habituated to the testing cage (new mouse cage) and optic fibres over 4 consecutive days, for 30 min daily. On the test day, the mice were habituated to the testing cage alone for 2 h and attached to optic fibres for 15 min before optogenetic stimulation. A 473 nm laser, pulsing at 20 Hz with 15 ms pulses, was applied for 30 s on and 30 s off cycles, for a total of 20 min. The light irradiance was around 4–5 mW mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; in the target region. After laser stimulation, the optic fibres were removed, and the mice remained undisturbed in the testing cage for 25 min before euthanasia. To minimize circadian rhythm effects on CORT levels, animals were tested between 1.5 to 5 h after lights turned off in the dark phase, with control and ChR2 groups counterbalanced during the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec42"&gt;Serum collection and CORT assaying&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After rapid cervical dislocation, terminal trunk blood was collected with heparinized microcapillary tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred into microfuge tubes, which were left on ice for at least 15–20 min. The blood samples were centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (serum) was collected and transferred into new tubes and the serum samples were frozen at −80 °C. The samples were packed and shipped on dry ice to the Center for Research in Reproduction Ligand Assay and Analysis Core at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, where they were processed (in duplicate) using a radioimmunoassay kit for CORT measurements. The brains were sectioned at 50 μm thickness and Nissl stained to assess the location of the implanted optic fibres. The researcher assessing the accuracy of the bilateral implant location was blinded to the treatment condition of the animal. Only animals with accurate bilateral implants in the DP were included in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec43"&gt;Statistical analyses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare the CORT levels between the experimental and control groups, Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test and nonparametric Mann–Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;-tests were used. Owing to the two-group comparisons, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value adjustment was not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec44"&gt;Social interaction experiments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec45"&gt;Surgery&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six VGLUT2-Cre (for DP) and six VGLUT1-Cre (for ILA) male mice (aged 6–8 weeks) were anaesthetized using a 1–2% isoflurane–oxygen mixture and injected unilaterally with 350 nl (1 nl s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) pAAV.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40 (Addgene, 100833-AAV1) into the DP. Then, 30 min after virus injection, a 6.1-mm-long (0.5 mm diameter) relay lens (Inscopix) was implanted over the DP: anteroposterior, +2.1 mm, mediolateral, 0.6 mm; dorsoventral, −3.2 mm. The lens was securely affixed to the skull using cyanoacrylate glue and dental cement and then covered with Kwik-Sil (WPI). Sample sizes for each of the experiments were chosen based on previous experience. Randomization was not necessary as VGLUT2-Cre animals received injection into the DP and the VGLUT1-Cre mice received injection in the ILA. Also, each of the animals underwent both social and non-social interaction behaviour tests (see below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three weeks later, the mice were anaesthetized as described previously and a UCLA V4 miniscope with an attached baseplate was positioned over the lens to visualize GCaMP6f expression. The focal plane was adjusted to optimize cell visibility, and the baseplate was secured in place with dental cement. A plastic cap was used to cover and protect the lens over the baseplate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec46"&gt;Behavioural tests&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with lens implantation in the DP or ILA were habituated to handling and the miniscope for 4–5 days. On the day of the open-field test, the miniscope was attached to the baseplate and the mice freely ran in an open arena (45 cm × 45 cm × 30 cm) for 20 min. On the day of same-sex social interaction, mice performed social interaction counterbalanced with object exploration in the same arena as the open-field test for 8 min per session. The next day, mice performed social interaction with opposite sex social targets for 8 min. Each social trial included an 8-min recording session, beginning with a 1-min period of the subject mouse alone, followed by a 7-min interaction with the social partner. On the day of same-sex social interaction counterbalanced with object exploration, after the first trial, the subject mouse rested with the LED off for approximately 5 min before starting the second trial. Calcium imaging and behaviour (miniCam) were recorded simultaneously at 30 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec47"&gt;Pre-processing and extraction of calcium signals&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging videos were motion corrected (NoRMCorre: &lt;a href="https://github.com/flatironinstitute/NoRMCorre"&gt;https://github.com/flatironinstitute/NoRMCorre&lt;/a&gt;; MiniAn: &lt;a href="https://github.com/denisecailab/minian"&gt;https://github.com/denisecailab/minian&lt;/a&gt;) and analysed with extended constrained non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF-E)-algorithm-based packages (MiniscopeAnalysis: &lt;a href="https://github.com/etterguillaume/MiniscopeAnalysis"&gt;https://github.com/etterguillaume/MiniscopeAnalysis&lt;/a&gt;; MiniAn: &lt;a href="https://github.com/denisecailab/minian"&gt;https://github.com/denisecailab/minian&lt;/a&gt;) to identify cells and extract cell activity. Denoised and demixed trace data were used for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec48"&gt;Identification of behaviour responsive cell&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether an individual neuron’s activity was significantly modulated by social interaction, we used ROC analysis to calculate an area under the curve (AUC) value for denoised calcium trace correspondence to binarized manually scored interaction bouts. The interaction bouts were defined when the imaged mouse actively investigated the social target/object within a distance of one-quarter to one-third of mouse body length. To determine whether the AUC values indicated that the neuron was significantly excited or inhibited by the interaction, we compared observed AUC values to a null distribution derived from circularly shuffled calcium signals (1,000 shuffles). Significance was determined using percentile thresholds, classifying neurons as significantly responsive if their auROC values surpassed the 97.5th percentile for excited neurons or the 2.5th percentile for inhibited neurons. Neurons that were neither excited nor inhibited were deemed non-responsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec49"&gt;Calcium event calculation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcium transients were identified using automatic detection algorithms in MATLAB (peakfinder) (&lt;a href="https://github.com/GradinaruLab/striatum2P"&gt;https://github.com/GradinaruLab/striatum2P&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec50"&gt;Statistical analyses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine whether there were differences in DP-miniscoped or ILA-miniscoped animals in the time spent interacting during non-social (object) versus social (same- or opposite-sex partner) testing, an omnibus one-way ANOVA was performed followed by post hoc Tukey’s multiple-comparison test, which controls for the family-wise error rate. To assess the percentage of behaviourally responsive cells and frequency of calcium events during non-social (open-field) and social (same- or opposite-sex partner) testing, an omnibus two-way ANOVA was performed followed by post hoc analyses using either Tukey’s tests (for within DP or ILA comparisons) or Šidák’s tests with adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values (for across DP and ILA comparisons) for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec51"&gt;DP neuronal activities in response to social and environmental stimuli&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec52"&gt;Male mice in response to social stimuli&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four male mice, aged between 12 and 14 weeks, were used for the study. To reduce potential stress by the testing environment, each mouse was habituated to a clean cage for four consecutive days, spending 2 to 4 h in the cage and with approximately 30 min in the recording position daily. On the testing day, the mice were habituated in the clean cage for about 2 h before the experiment. Unfamiliar male mice, female mice and postnatal day 7 pups were used as the social stimuli. Each mouse was exposed to three instances of the same type of social stimulus, lasting about 6 min each, for a total duration of 20 min, with six mice in each group. In the control group, the cages were opened three times as well, but without introducing any intruders. The mice remained undisturbed in their individual cages for 80 min before perfusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec53"&gt;Acute-restraint stress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4, male) subjected to acute-restraint stress were removed from the colony room, transferred to a behavioural testing room for 1 h and then placed into a Tailveiner restrainer for mice (Braintree Scientific). This device consists of a clear tube, within which a plug was adjusted to limit voluntary movement. Acute restraint stress was applied for 30 min and terminated 30 min before the animals were euthanized. Throughout all studies, control mice (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4, male) underwent numerous sensory manipulations that were carried out in parallel with those for the mice in the restraint stress group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec54"&gt;Acute looming sound stimuli in comparison with white noise and foot shock&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec55"&gt;Subjects&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRAP2-CreER&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 70" title="DeNardo, L.

&lt;p&gt;The global research team says moving to this view could ultimately lead to better disease management for people with MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our data clearly show that MS cannot be characterized by subtypes such as relapsing or progressive MS, but is instead a continuous disease process with definable state transitions,” Heinz Wiendl, MD, a professor at the University of Freiburg and one of the study’s senior authors, said in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-08-ai-redefines-multiple-sclerosis-continuum.html"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt; outlining the study’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Instead of categorizing [MS] patients, we should quantify their state and track it dynamically,” said Wiendl, a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03901-6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI-driven reclassification of multiple sclerosis progression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord. The neurodegenerative disease is categorized into three main &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/4-types-ms/"&gt;types&lt;/a&gt; based on its clinical presentation, meaning the symptoms seen among patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;Relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS) is characterized by &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-flares/"&gt;relapses&lt;/a&gt;, or periods in which symptoms worsen, interspersed with periods of remission, where symptoms ease or go away entirely. It is thought to be largely driven by inflammatory activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progressive MS is marked by symptoms that steadily worsen over time, with neurodegeneration that happens even without relapses or signs of active inflammation. In &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/primary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-ppms/"&gt;primary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt; (PPMS), this progression starts right from disease onset, whereas &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/secondary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-spms/"&gt;secondary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt; (SPMS) follows RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disease type now determines treatment strategies for patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These classifications are used to determine treatment strategies and predict prognosis. However, evidence suggests that the distinctions may not be so clear-cut — and that they may have limited value for predicting the disease course and treatment responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This raises the important question of whether the current MS categorization into distinct subtypes is justified or whether MS would be better described as a disease continuum from a focal inflammatory to a progressive disease course,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the scientists used an AI-based approach to develop a new MS classification system that would be independent of the diagnosed disease type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They built the AI model using data from more than 8,000 people with RRMS, SPMS, or PPMS who were included in a large Novartis-sponsored clinical trial database. The data came from nine Phase 2/3 clinical trials, and covered up to 15 years of follow-up, with approximately 120,000 neurological assessments and more than 35,000 &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-mri-preparation/"&gt;MRI scans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;[Emerging evidence] raises the important question of whether the current MS categorization into distinct subtypes is justified or whether MS would be better described as a disease continuum from a focal inflammatory to a progressive disease course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified four aspects of MS that best capture its progression: physical disability, brain damage, clinical relapses, and silent inflammatory activity seen on MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These variables were used to build a model that gives a probabilistic assessment of how likely people with MS are to transition between eight distinct disease states over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This included states 1-3, which are early phases of clinical stability with minimal disability, and stage 4, or asymptomatic MRI disease activity. State 5 corresponds to a clinical relapse, and states 6-8 are phases of advanced MS in which there’s less inflammation but greater neurodegeneration and disability. States 4 and 5 were both considered intermediate inflammatory stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this framework, patients don’t have to move linearly through these states. Instead, they can transition in any order or direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the data indicated that it’s nearly impossible for a person to progress directly to advanced stages without first experiencing some type of intermediate inflammatory activity. Further, once patients are in advanced stages, they won’t return to an early clinically stable phase, the data indicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most people diagnosed with either SPMS or PPMS were considered to be in advanced stages, the data don’t support distinguishing between the two entities, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;AI-based model now must be tested in clinical practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI approach was then validated using data from a separate clinical trial and real-world databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the model was accurate in predicting a person’s risk of transitioning to advanced MS, according to the researchers. Data also showed that treatment with an MS &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapy&lt;/a&gt; increases the odds that a person will stay in early, mild disease stages for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings support a new way of describing MS, the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our … model results are more compatible with the view of MS as a disease continuum than with the traditional view of distinct [types],” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, scientists hope this new framework will help patients access treatment more easily. The currently used classification system limits which patients can access DMTs, as most are indicated for relapsing disease types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the new system were to be adopted, it would allow for treatment to be initiated based on individual risk assessment, regardless of the diagnosed disease type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Patients with active but clinically silent inflammatory activity, in particular, require early treatment decisions, as the model strikingly demonstrates,” the news story noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the model needs to be tested in clinical practice to see how useful it is for making MS treatment decisions in real-world settings, according to the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AI model could have implications beyond MS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lutz Hein, MD, who is not one of the study’s authors but serves as dean of the faculty of medicine at the University of Freiburg, noted that the idea behind this AI model — to move past rigid disease categorizations — also has implications beyond MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The principle is fundamental and pioneering—and it can also be applied to many other diseases, both within neurology and beyond,” Hein said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glucose drives T cell signaling. Stronger signals mean better cancer defense.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the body’s disease-fighting T cells, glucose is much more than just a simple sugar rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490871" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490871" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Russell-Jones.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-490871" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Russell-Jones.jpg" alt="Russell Jones" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Russell-Jones.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Russell-Jones-400x533.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Russell-Jones-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Russell-Jones-150x200.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Russell-Jones-450x600.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490871" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Russell Jones, Ph.D. Credit: Van Andel Institute&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the Van Andel Institute have uncovered that glucose, a critical fuel source for immune cells, also plays a key role in T cell communication and enhances their tumor-fighting abilities. This insight could help refine how T cells are used to battle cancer and other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research is detailed in a study published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why T cells need glucose&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Immune cells are highly influenced by their environment,” said Joseph Longo, Ph.D., the study’s first author and a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Russell Jones, Ph.D. “We knew that T cells need access to glucose to function, but we didn’t know exactly why. It was previously thought that T cells mainly break down glucose for energy, but our new work shows that T cells use glucose as a building block for other molecules that are necessary to support T cells’ anti-cancer properties.”&lt;/p&gt;

These sugar-fat compounds are essential for T cell growth, internal communication and making proteins that T cells use to combat cancer. The findings, published in Cell Metabolism by Van Andel Institute scientists, offer a potential path toward improving T cells’ ability to fight cancer and infection.

&lt;p&gt;The findings reveal that T cells allocate significant portions of glucose to build large molecules called glycosphingolipids (GSLs). These sugar-fat compounds are essential for T cell growth and making proteins that T cells use to combat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSLs help form fat-rich structures on T cell surfaces called lipid rafts, which bring together cell signaling proteins that instruct the T cell to kill cancer cells. Without GSLs, these signals are weaker, making T cells less effective at destroying tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The old adage “ignorance is bliss” feels especially fitting when it comes to healthcare. In fact, new research reveals that one in three people avoids—or is likely to avoid—medical information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/abm/article/59/1/kaaf058/8229759?login=true"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine earlier this month, researchers investigated data from 92 studies involving 564,497 participants from 25 countries. Despite the fact that successful treatment often depends on early detection, their results indicate that many people are reluctant to engage in preventive care or checkups. These first-of-their-kind global estimates carry significant implications for health policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Avoidance highest for Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Medical information is more accessible than ever, but many people choose to avoid it,” the researchers wrote in the study. “We found that nearly 1 in 3 people avoided or were likely to avoid medical information.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People were most likely to avoid information about incurable neurodegenerative diseases—41% for Alzheimer’s and 40% for Huntington’s. Avoidance dropped slightly for serious but treatable conditions like HIV (32%) and cancer (29%) and was lowest for chronic, manageable illnesses like diabetes, at 24%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers described medical information avoidance as “any behavior designed to prevent or delay the acquisition of available but potentially unwanted information,” such as delaying or missing doctor’s appointments and refusing medical tests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While one might suggest that a lack of information or high financial costs are to blame, the study includes Germany. There, health insurance companies communicate appropriate services to their members and usually cover the expenses. Unfortunately, however, the study did not allow for the direct comparisons of information avoidance between countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One possibility is that the choice not to know is a deliberate one,” Ralph Hertwig, co-author of the study and director of the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, said in an institute &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/25246796/avoidance-of-information-about-own-health"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We have investigated this phenomenon—which we call deliberate ignorance—in other areas of life and found that there are a wide variety of reasons for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Why do people avoid information about their health?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team identified 16 key predictors of this avoidance. Interestingly, these did not include gender, race, or ethnicity. The most significant predictors were feeling overwhelmed, low confidence in managing one’s health, the fear of being judged, and mistrust and lack of confidence in the medical system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Patterns of avoidance varied across world regions, suggesting that differences in healthcare systems may influence behavior,” the researchers explained in the paper, adding that they did not investigate how medical information avoidance impacts patients’ health. “More research is needed to understand the psychological and medical consequences of avoiding medical information.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In fact, the team highlights that their research does not judge if medical information avoidance is positive or negative—it reveals that the behavior is common and not always irrational. Furthermore, the identified avoidance predictors highlight potential areas for policy interventions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, “our findings suggest that lower trust is associated with higher information avoidance,” lead study author Konstantin Offer, a predoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, said in the statement. “Restoring trust in the medical system could therefore lead to greater engagement with medical information.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In other words, if you dread attending checkups or learning your medical test results, you’re far from being the only one, since many people avoid it altogether. But it remains to be seen how this avoidance might impact people’s health.&lt;/p&gt;

Over a whole lifetime, a person’s chromosomes may appear more frayed because the cells have replicated so many times, scientists said. The authors also looked for anti-aging effects of fatty acids, but that part of the study found “no significant effect.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The biggest discovery came when researchers saw that the chromosomes of people who took daily vitamin D3 pills appeared younger than those of the control group, said study author JoAnn Manson. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It was intriguing that we found that vitamin D supplementation did protect against a key pathway of biological aging,” said Manson, a medical professor at Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Specifically, protective caps on the ends of chromosomes — which have long been known to shorten with age — measured longer at the end of the study in the vitamin D3 group, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525002552?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525002552?via%3Dihub"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The shortening of the protective caps, called telomeres, is an “aging biomarker” that signals someone is more prone to inflammation and disease, Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Shorter telomeres lead the entire X-shaped chromosome to deteriorate with age, “which increases risks for chronic diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality,” the study said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Michael Holick, a national expert on vitamin D, said the study’s findings are consistent with other research showing people with insufficient vitamin D3 levels are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, and even infectious diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“These data are very supportive of the fact that it definitely improves health outcomes,” said Holick, a professor at the Boston University School of Medicine who was not involved in the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;On average, study participants who took daily vitamin D3 for four years had telomere lengths consistent with only one year of aging&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;over that period, the study found. The telomeres of participants in the placebo group had average lengths consistent with four years of aging, scientists said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Over four years, there was protection against three years of biological aging through that pathway of telomere shortening, which was an intriguing finding,” Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Importantly, the study findings do not trump what doctors and scientists have long told patients about naturally occurring forms of vitamin D, Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Most importantly, we are recommending that people try to follow a healthy diet that’s high in fruits, vegetables, and whole foods, and really minimize processed and ultra-processed foods,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Vitamin D supplements will never outweigh the positive biological effects of healthy diet and exercise regimens, which provide the human body with sufficient vitamin D, Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We do believe that a healthy diet healthy lifestyle are paramount and will never be replaced by popping any pill,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Still, the study findings are important because they provide some proof that supplementing vitamin D intake in the winter months can have benefits at the cellular level, Manson said. People who have chronic conditions that prevent them from eating certain vitamin D-rich foods can also use vitamin D pills to effectively fill a nutritional gap, she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s quite reasonable, as a form of insurance to take 1,000 to 2,000 IUs a day if you have concerns about getting adequate intake from the diet or time spent outdoors,” Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Holick, who is known for discovering the major form of vitamin D that circulates in human blood, said he recommends his patients take at least 2,000 IUs of vitamin D3 daily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The data is very clear — if you are vitamin D deficient, you’re at more increased risk of mortality,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Without it, our focus softens, our experience of the world blurs, and our identities melt away. But as people age, their memory declines. Many billions of dollars have been spent to understand the biological basis of dementia and to devise a cure. In most cases, they have failed spectacularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if, rather than study the brains of people with advanced memory loss, we instead studied the brains of people with the opposite condition: extraordinary memory and brain health in old age?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few decades, Sandra Weintraub, a scientist at Northwestern University, has been part of a team studying the brains of “super-agers,” people 80 and older who have the memory ability of people in their 50s. In a new paper published this year to considerable fanfare, she found that super-agers didn’t have much in common. They didn’t share a diet, or an exercise regimen, or a set of maladies or medications. One thing, however, united them: their social relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s guest is Sandra Weintraub. We talk about the science of memory and the brain and the protective benefit of social connection for our minds and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg extended-description" data-sentry-component="Wysiwyg" data-sentry-source-file="wysiwyg.tsx"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the following excerpt, Sandra Weintraub explains to Derek how she got into the field of memory and aging research and defines some of the terms essential to that field. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derek Thompson:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Your research spans memory, aging, Alzheimer’s, dementia. What got you into this space?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sandra Weintraub:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; What got me into this? Well, OK, so if you really want to go way back to my undergraduate years at McGill University, McGill was kind of the first place in North America to really be interested in the brain and behavior. How does your brain do all the things that you do: think and talk and behave and sing and all of that? So I was incredibly interested in that, but there was no real field that was a clinical field for people who were interested in brain and behavior unless you wanted to be a neurosurgeon or a neurologist, which I didn’t want to do that. So over the years, this specialty developed of neuropsychology, and I decided that’s what I wanted to do because neuropsychology is the clinical psychology specialty devoted to working with the results of brain injury. Not kind of therapy or your feelings, but really somebody who has been developing normally has a brain injury: What happens, and why does it happen, and what are the different parts of the brain that cause it to happen? That’s where I really started.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My interest in aging, I then went to work at the Boston Aphasia Research Center and was very interested in people who had had strokes, who lost their language. And I worked there for a very long time. And then when I was ready, finished my degree and ready to get a job, I had my first job at a hospital that had a lot of older patients, and a lot of the older patients that I was seeing—and in those days, of course, people just never got the medical attention until things were really advanced. So I was seeing people who were in pretty late stages of dementia, and as I worked more and more in this field, and as we made more progress, we began to realize that you don’t wake up with dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It starts 10, 20 years earlier, and we started seeing people earlier and earlier and earlier. So then I became really interested in: What is the earliest sign of a dementia? We always think of memory loss, but in our case, we’ve discovered that you can have an aphasia as the first sign of a progressive dementia, or you can have visuospatial deficits, or you can have behavioral changes. So I really got interested in: What can these neurodegenerative diseases tell me about the human brain and how it works? Then there was this thing called “normal aging,” and I started seeing people who were worried about their memory, but they didn’t have any problems when they were tested. And so I saw people who seemed to be kind of normal for their age, and then I saw people who were incredible that had memories like a 20-year-old, and I got really interested in: Why do those people, well, how can they preserve their memory?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thompson:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Let me just stop you right there before you finish your story. I would love to make sure that we retrace some of the vocabulary here. Tell me what aphasia is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weintraub:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Sure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thompson: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;And then also, could you slow down and distinguish between what one might call “normal memory loss” and what is diagnosed as dementia or Alzheimer’s?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weintraub:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Those are very excellent questions. So the first thing you asked was: What is aphasia? Aphasia is a term—I mean, if you want to break it down from the Latin, it means “without language or without speech”—and it is the term that’s applied to a loss of the ability to communicate using words, understanding words, reading words, anything that has to do with your brain making words. Usually, it’s due to a stroke, but it can also be due to neurodegeneration in the part of the brain that controls your language function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thompson:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; And when we’re defining dementia and Alzheimer’s, what are we talking about here?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weintraub: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;How long do you have, because … So normal aging is if you take 1,000 people between 65 and 85, and you give them a test, and you get a total score on the test, and then you average the score on that test: That’s what’s considered average for that age range. However, if you look at who’s at the bottom and who’s at the top, you have a huge spread across that average. I don’t know if you know what the standard deviation is, but it’s kind of variation around a mean. So when you take 30-year-olds and you do that test, their standard deviation is much, much smaller. If you take 80-year-olds, it’s huge. So it means that there are people at the top of that standard deviation that are performing like 30-year-olds, and that’s … So I don’t believe in normal aging. For me, there’s no such thing as normal aging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, how do you tell if somebody is really having problems? And when you use the word &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;dementia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, we don’t talk about dementia; we talk about cognitive impairment, because there are stages. So you can start off with what’s called mild cognitive impairment, and if this is a neurodegenerative, it keeps going over time, and it eventually turns into a dementia, which means that you have cognitive impairment so severe that you can no longer function in your daily life. A lot of people have mild cognitive impairment, and they’re fine daily. They can drive. They can do finances. They’re just a little annoyed by their memory loss. But when it gets to the point where you’re not remembering things, you miss paying bills, you’re forgetting where you’re going when you’re driving, that’s what we call dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., more than 38 million Americans have diabetes (about 1 in 10), of which some 90–95 percent have type 2, in which the body either can't use insulin effectively, or does not produce enough of it to regulate blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecnoglutide—which is not yet licensed—and dulaglutide both help manage blood sugar levels by acting on the same receptor in the body, known as the GLP-1 receptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecnoglutide targets specific pathways in the body that enhance insulin production and lower blood sugar, while avoiding another pathway that can sometimes reduce the receptor's activity, the researchers explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dulaglutide, on the other hand, turns on both pathways the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ecnoglutide demonstrates a better efficacy of weight loss and blood sugar control compared to existing medications in the trials," study author Feifei Jiang told &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 52-week study of more than 600 adults in China with type 2 diabetes, participants who received ecnoglutide saw their average blood sugar drop by about 1.9 percent, compared to a 1.65 percent drop in participants who received dulaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People taking ecnoglutide also lost nearly twice as much weight as those on dulaglutide, experiencing an average body weight reduction of 5.2–5.7 percent compared to an average weight loss of 2.8 percent for those taking dulaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional weight loss seen in participants taking ecnoglutide could further help diabetes management and reduce risks of heart disease, according to the authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on currently available information (primarily from clinical trials), the types of side effects associated with ecnoglutide are expected to be similar to those of existing GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as semaglutide or dulaglutide), primarily including gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) and decreased appetite. Most cases were mild to moderate side effects and tended to decrease gradually with prolonged treatment," Jiang explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecnoglutide is also simpler to produce than other GLP-1 receptor agonists, the study highlights. This means it can be manufactured more quickly and at a lower cost than other weight loss medications currently available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests ecnoglutide could be a valuable new treatment option for people with type 2 diabetes, offering effective blood sugar control and weight loss, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;figure class="block block-ibtg-article fA" data-gtm-category="Related In-Text A" data-gtm-action="Click"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of how it comparises to Ozempic, the researchers wrote in the paper: "Ecnoglutide, a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist, is composed entirely of natural amino acids with chemical modifications to enhance stability and activity, differing from semaglutide by four amino acids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They explained these modifications not only improve how the drug works but the manufacturing process in this case too. Unlike semaglutide, which requires extra chemical steps to attach additional amino acids, ecnoglutide can be made more directly through genetically engineered cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although this study presents a valuable comparison of ecnoglutide with dulaglutide, comparisons with semaglutide are also of clinical interest due to the structural similarity between ecnoglutide and semaglutide, and the greater glycemic and weight-lowering effects reported with semaglutide versus dulaglutide," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, at the time of study conduct, limited availability of semaglutide in China made its inclusion as a comparator unfeasible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the researchers said side-by-side consideration with the Phase &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33074557/" target="_blank" title="3 SUSTAIN-China study" class="multivariate"&gt;3 SUSTAIN-China study&lt;/a&gt; of semaglutide might offer some insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although no direct comparison has been conducted, these findings indirectly suggest that their efficacy might be similar. Future head-to-head trials will be required to confirm this," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiang explained that SUSTAIN-China showed average blood sugar was reduced by 1.4 percent to 1.7 percent with semaglutide after 30 weeks, whereas with ecnoglutide it dropped by 1.89 percent to 1.91 percent after 32 weeks (shown in the separate study).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, body weight was reduced by 5.2 percent to 5.7 percent with ecnoglutide after 52 weeks, while it was reduced by 3.9 percent to 5.7 percent with semaglutide after 30 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those results suggest that the efficacy of ecnoglutide might be similar or even better than semaglutide in glycemic control," Jiang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies are needed to explore ecnoglutide's efficacy across diverse populations and in combination with other antidiabetic agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ecnoglutide has not yet received formal marketing authorization for any indication in any country or region worldwide, in China, new drug applications (NDAs) are under review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ecnoglutide is expected to achieve optimal efficacy when combined with behavioral and lifestyle support interventions. Lifestyle guidance like dietary planning and exercise recommendations helps patients establish sustainable healthy habits," said Jiang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a tip on a health story that &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; should be covering?

Morten Harket (right) from the Norwegian group A-ha recently announced his diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For too long, Parkinson's has been fundamentally misunderstood,' they said. 'The majority of the public, and even many scientists, still view the disease as an inevitable consequence of aging. In their eyes, the disease reflects increasing longevity and the unfortunate consequence of genetics. They are mistaken.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors identify the research that has established the more likely cause of the rise in Parkinson's: the pesticides in our food and farms, the industrial toxins in the water we drink and the hidden particles in the air we breathe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Armed with that knowledge, they say, a few simple lifestyle changes - from using water and air filters to rolling up your car windows in traffic - can reduce exposure and actually prevent the onset of Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believe their recommendations can even be effective with people who have a family history of the disease, and those who have already started to show symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is never too late to get started,' they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We take a lesson from smoking.

Let's apply what we have learned and begin preventing the disease now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Below are five of their 25 steps to prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Wash your produce (even if it's organic)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pesticides have made their way into our food supply. In 2024, Consumer Reports found that remnants of pesticides posed a significant health risk in 20 percent of common foods that it examined, including blueberries, bell peppers and potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Purchasing organic produce, dairy products and meat can all help reduce exposure. However, even organic produce can have unsafe pesticide residues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regardless of whether you buy organic or conventional fruits and vegetables, wash them. Use water and possibly a vegetable wash, because, like dirt, many pesticides do not dissolve in water. These washes are available in many grocery stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pesticides have made their way into our food supply - foods at particular risk include blueberries, bell peppers and potatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Regardless of whether you buy organic or conventional fruits and vegetables, wash them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vinegar and salt solutions are good options too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To determine what levels of pesticides are safe, the US Department of Agriculture measures them after food has been washed with water for 15 to 20 seconds. If that is their practice, yours should be even longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another way to reduce your overall exposure to pesticides without buying entirely organic produce is to consult the reports of the Environmental Working Group, which lists foods with a lot of exposure (the Dirty Dozen) and those with much less (the Clean Fifteen). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another good way to learn what pesticides are being used is to go to a farmer's market or join a community-supported agricultural farm where you can speak to the farmers who grow the crops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Don't go to a grocery store near a dry cleaners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perchloroethylene (PCE), the dry-cleaning chemical, can readily spread beyond the walls of a dry cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PCE dissolves in fat. In Germany, the chemical has been found in dairy products at supermarkets near dry cleaners - the levels at those shops were two to 20 times the levels found in those farther away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Germany now prohibits supermarkets from being located close to dry cleaners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, next time you go shopping at your local market, look around at the neighboring businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Have a cup of coffee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has repeatedly demonstrated that caffeine consumption is associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine may protect the dopamine-producing nerve cells from the damage that results from exposure to toxicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits appear to be present regardless of your beverage of choice (coffee or tea) but are not present with decaffeinated drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, caffeine has its own health risks, such as spurring on anxiety and headaches. But thanks to the research, you now have another reason to enjoy your morning cup of joe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Exercise is the best tool we have in the neurodegeneration prevention tool kit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his best-selling book, Outlive, Dr Peter Attia wrote: 'I now tell patients that exercise is, full stop and hands down, the best tool we have in the neurodegeneration prevention tool kit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise may improve the function of the mitochondria, the energy-producing parts of cells, that are damaged by toxicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical activity also releases growth factors in the brain that protect nerve cells, including the dopamine-producing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vigorous exercise can lower the risk of developing Parkinson's, and moving every day is also beneficial for those who already have the disease. A recent study found that six months of aerobic exercise (riding a stationary bike at least three times weekly, for example) reduced brain atrophy and slowed disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ask your favorite course or club what pesticides they use and when they spray&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Golf with caution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While no studies, to our knowledge, have examined rates of Parkinson's among avid golfers, one study in 1996 looked at the death certificates of golf course superintendents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that these workers who commonly use pesticides to keep golf courses weed-free had twice the risk of dying due to a nervous system disorder than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What are the 25 million golfers in the US and 67 million worldwide to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ask your favorite course or club what pesticides they use and when they spray, encourage them to use less, and have them consider safer alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the interim, avoid playing on courses just after they have been sprayed, and don't lick your golf ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The full list of 25 actions is published in The Parkinson's Plan: A New Path to Prevention and Treatment by Ray Dorsey MD and Michael S Okun MD, PublicAffairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But some new research suggests that you might be able to counteract high blood pressure to some degree with a humble veggie: the beet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the major takeaway from a study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584925008068" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Free Radical Biology and Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Free Radical Biology and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (and plenty of other research, TBH). But why beets? And how much of the stuff do you need to consume to really reap the health benefits? Here’s what you need to know, with expert insights from a doctor and two nutritionists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sonya Angelone, RDN,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sonya Angelone, RDN,&lt;/a&gt; a nutritionist and registered dietitian based in San Francisco; &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheng-Han Chen, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA; Christy Brissette, MS, RD, owner of &lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80 Twenty Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80 Twenty Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers recruited 39 people under the age of 30 as well as 36 people in their 60s and 70s, and had them go through two different two-week phases. In one phase, they consumed nitrate-rich beetroot juice (a.k.a. beet juice) daily. In the second phase, people consumed a placebo version of the drink with nitrates removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you’re not familiar with nitrates, they're compounds of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/mn/what-nitrate" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nitrogen and oxygen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nitrogen and oxygen&lt;/a&gt; that occur naturally in the soil, water, vegetables, and processed meats. Nitrates in vegetables are converted to nitric oxide, which has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006295222004191" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-health benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart-health benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between the two phases, the participants had a two-week “wash out” period to reset their bodies. The researchers also used bacterial gene sequencing to find microbes that were in the participants’ mouths before and after each treatment phase. They took blood pressure readings, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers ultimately found that participants' oral microbiome changed dramatically after they consumed the nitrate-rich beet juice, but there were differences between the older and younger groups. The older group experienced a noticeable drop in the oral bacteria Prevotella after drinking beet juice, as well as an increase in good oral bacteria, like Neisseria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The older group initially had higher average blood pressure readings at the beginning of the study, but their blood pressure dropped after they had the nitrate-rich beetroot juice. (But not after they had the placebo drink.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do beets help lower blood pressure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first study to link beets to lower blood pressure. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8965354/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientific analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;scientific analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in 2022 found that people saw an improvement in their blood pressure consuming 70 milliliters, 140 milliliters, and 250 milliliters (about a cup) of beet juice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475324002369" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in 2024 found that there was a “significant effect” on systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) up to 90 days after participants had a daily dose of beet juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But…why? Well, it's a slightly complicated process. “Beets contain nitrates which are converted to nitrites by good bacteria in the mouth,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sonya Angelone, RDN,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sonya Angelone, RDN,&lt;/a&gt; a nutritionist and registered dietitian based in San Francisco. “The nitrites-rich saliva is swallowed, where it is converted to nitric oxide in the stomach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That nitric oxide is then absorbed into the bloodstream, where it helps blood vessels relax and widen, in a process called vasodilation, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheng-Han Chen, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA. "This process improves blood pressure," he says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria in your mouth matters, too. "Without the right balance of good bacteria in your mouth, the conversion of the nitrates in beets can’t happen, so you won't get the blood pressure-lowering effects from beets or beet root juice," says Christy Brissette, MS, RD, owner of &lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80 Twenty Nutrition.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80 Twenty Nutrition.&lt;/a&gt; "Eating a diet that is high in inorganic nitrates from beets and green leafy vegetables also seems to prevent the growth of unhealthy bacteria in the mouth, which could also help to lower blood pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other health benefits do beets have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beets actually have a lot going for them outside of blood pressure. They're also a good source of fiber "which is good for digestion and gut health,” Angelone says. And they contain antioxidants which can help reduce inflammation and lower your risk for chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only that, beets contain folate and potassium, which are good for heart health. “They may also support athletic performance by enhancing the mitochondrial function, the energy producing structure in the cells,” Angelone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much should I be eating to reap the benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the health benefits from beets, it’s good to eat about a cup of the veggie nearly every day, Angelone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you have high blood pressure, Brissette says it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider about the lifestyle moves you’re making to try to get that blood pressure back down. Also, keep in mind that beets or beet juice aren’t designed to replace any blood pressure-lowering medication you may be on—but they can support your efforts, per Dr. Chen. "The reductions in blood pressure are modest, but they are measurable," Dr. Chen adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more thing to point out: Beets aren't the only nitrate-rich veggie out there. So, if this vegetable isn't for you, consider loading up spinach, celery, and kale to reap similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBJRzlxVGtxSDNLdW1FMThJcUFCa3VoUG1kRkRzM1AtMXNhalFGSmF6djBIS3hMblpIalk5Q1RNaVdMQk85aFE0bVFqWGN5X1VJaHdjLWNLLWhmQm9qanBybnNmUl9WRlJ5VERTbjhQbmhwOGVD</guid></item><item><title>几十年来，科学家们对幻肢的看法一直是错误的–新研究- The Conversation</title><link>https://theconversation.com/scientists-have-been-wrong-about-phantom-limbs-for-decades-new-study-263547</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside every human brain lies a detailed map of the body, with different regions dedicated to different body parts – the hands, lips, feet and more. But what happens to this map when a body part is removed? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/144/7/1929/6206526"&gt;scientists believed&lt;/a&gt; that when a body part is amputated, the brain’s body map dramatically reorganises itself, with neighbouring body parts taking over the area once represented by the missing limb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea of large-scale brain reorganisation became a central pillar of what neuroscientists call adult brain plasticity: the ability of the brain to change its structure and function in response to injuries, new experiences or training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02037-7"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, shows the opposite is true: the brain’s body map remains strikingly stable, even years after amputation.
To test what happens in the brain after a person loses a body part, we took a unique approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with NHS surgeons, we followed three adult patients who were preparing to undergo lifesaving arm amputations for medical reasons, such as cancer or severe problems with blood supply. We scanned their brains with functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before the amputation and repeatedly afterwards – in some cases for as long as five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the MRI scans, we asked patients to move different body parts: tapping their individual fingers, curling their toes or pursing their lips. This allowed us to map brain activity and to construct the brain’s body map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the surgery, we repeated the scans, this time asking them to move their missing (phantom) fingers. Phantom movements are not imaginary: most amputees continue to feel vivid sensations of their missing limbs, even though they are physically no longer there. Doing so gave us a rare opportunity to directly compare the brain’s hand map before and after amputation in the same person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discovered that, across all three patients, the map of the hand in the brain remained remarkably unchanged and did not get overwritten by other body parts, such as the face. This neural stability helps explain why so many amputees continue to feel their missing limbs so vividly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most amputees, however, phantom sensations are not neutral sensations; they are painful and described as burning, stabbing or itching. For years, the dominant explanation for these painful sensations came from the idea that the brain’s body map has reorganised itself. In turn, this theory inspired therapies such as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnPxKr1dMU0"&gt;mirror box therapy&lt;/a&gt;, virtual reality training, or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QplcT2MjuEc"&gt;sensory-discrimination exercises&lt;/a&gt;, all aimed at fixing supposedly broken maps. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings show the brain’s body map is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; broken. This helps explain why these therapies consistently fail to outperform placebo treatments in clinical trials. If the map remains intact, trying to fix it is a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The real culprit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, our results suggest we should look elsewhere, for example, in the nerves that are cut during surgery. Severed nerves can form tangled clusters that misfire signals back to the brain. New amputation surgical techniques are being developed to preserve nerve signalling and maintain stable connections to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings have important implications for developing prosthetic limbs and brain-computer interfaces. Invasive next-generation brain-computer interfaces can tap directly into the preserved map of the amputated body part to decode what movements are being attempted or even deliver electrical stimulation to the map to enable amputees to feel their missing limb. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These technologies are in development and could, one day, restore natural and intuitive control and sensations of a prosthetic limb, by using the preserved body map. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results show that our brains have a resilient model of the body that maintains the representations, even when the sensory input is lost. For amputees, this means that the missing limb lives on in the brain, sometimes as a source of discomfort, but also as a resource for future technologies to use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

                A new study finds that the brain does not appear to significantly rewire its map of the body after an amputation.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A rare circulatory problem required Emily Wheldon to have her left arm amputated three years ago. Her brain still thinks it's there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Most days, it just feels like I've got my arm next to me," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The perception is so compelling that Wheldon had to train herself not to rely on the missing limb.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When I first had the amputation," she says, "I was trying to put my arm out to stop myself from falling."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Now, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02037-7" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of Wheldon and two other people with arm amputations may help explain why they are living with phantom limbs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brain scans showed that in all three, "the phantom hand representation is exactly similar to the pre-amputated hand representation," even five years after surgery, says &lt;a href="https://www.rnel.pitt.edu/people/hunter-schone-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Hunter Schone&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral associate at the University of Pittsburgh who started the project as a doctoral student at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The finding, which appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, challenges decades-old research in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1843843" target="_blank"&gt;monkeys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/375482a0" target="_blank"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that after losing sensory input from a limb, the brain dramatically reorganizes the areas linked to that limb.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure the [new] study really negates that research," says &lt;a href="https://www.pennstatehealth.org/doctors/krishnankutty-sathian-mbbs-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Krish Sathian&lt;/a&gt;, the chair of neuroscience at Penn State Health, who was not involved in the research. "But the plot thickens, which is always the case in science."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sathian and Schone agree the finding bodes well for people who rely on a surgically implanted brain-computer interface to control a prosthetic or robotic limb. The interface depends on the brain maintaining for many years the circuits once used to move an arm, hand, or leg.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A brain map of the body&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news study involved three people who knew they were going to have an amputation because of cancer or some other disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Researchers performed MRI scans before and after the amputation to look for changes in the &lt;a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/thinking-sensing-and-behaving/touch/2020/the-neuroscience-of-touch-and-pain-013020#:~:text=Sensations%20begin%20as%20signals%20generated,they're%20several%20centimeters%20apart." target="_blank"&gt;somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt;, an area of the brain that maintains a detailed map of the body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you touch something with your hand, a certain region's activated," Schone says. "If you feel something with your toes, a different region is activated."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before the amputation, participants in the scanner would move their fingers, allowing scientists to see which brain regions responded. Up to five years after the amputation, participants imagined moving their missing fingers.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Earlier studies had suggested that after the loss of a hand, the brain would shift the borders of its body map. The area responding to the missing hand would shrink, while the neighboring area linked to the lips would expand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that's not what the team found.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's no evidence that the map of the lips is changing," Schone says, "which goes completely against all of those old studies that suggest if you lose this body part, this region of the brain is going to completely reorganize."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Earlier studies were limited because they compared the brains of people who'd already lost a limb with the brains of typical people. The new study appears to be the first to look at the same person's brain before and after an amputation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Prosthetic arms and phantom limb pain&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Like many people who've had an amputation, Wheldon often feels pain in her phantom arm and hand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's like a throbbing pain that becomes quite unbearable at times," she says. Sometimes it feels like her wrist is sore, other times it's like her fingers are cramping.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Previous research suggested phantom limb pain was the result of changes in the brain's body map. But the new study suggests it occurs &lt;em&gt;because &lt;/em&gt;the map hasn't changed, and the brain is still expecting signals from the missing body part.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Imagine if you had a nerve that was receiving a highly detailed information for the body and suddenly now it's receiving some strange, atypical input," Schone says. "How the brain would deal with something like this?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It might interpret the input as pain, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If so, he says, the solution may lie in finding a new home for a nerve ending, rather than just leaving it exposed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An unchanging body map could be a huge boost for the emerging field of brain-computer interfaces, which can allow a paralyzed person to speak or move a robotic arm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many of these interfaces place electrodes in the same area of the brain that maintains the body map. So they depend on that map remaining constant over many years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new evidence for this "offers a lot of hope for patients with neurological conditions," Sathian says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Emily Wheldon isn't seeking a brain-computer interface that could control a prosthetic left arm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But she says it's helpful just to have a scientific explanation of why her missing limb still seems like it's attached, and sometimes hurts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of people don't realize that you can actually still feel the limb," she says, "and they're shocked when I say I'm suffering from phantom pain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wheldon has been able to control that pain with electrical stimulation and a therapy that uses a visual representation of the missing limb. And she says the phantom pain is much less severe than the pain she felt when her arm was still there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Back then, the pain was so intense I couldn't look after my newborn daughter," she says. Now she's back at work and able to help her kids get dressed and ready for school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Social distancing is just a vague memory. Interest in vaccines is waning. COVID, for many, feels like an inevitable annoyance, like the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, each summer, we get a rude reminder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The season of travel and fun continues to bring a spike in COVID-19 activity, far less profound than during the height of the pandemic but enough for people to notice and worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer’s jump is being fueled by the subvariant XFG, nicknamed “Stratus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we learn more about COVID, we are seeing that it has two surges a year: the late fall/early winter and in the summer, so we expect this trend of increased cases in the summer to continue,” said Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, the regional chief of infectious disease at Kaiser Permanente Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-summer" class="subhead"&gt;Why summer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of factors that could explain why COVID activity seems to ramp up along with the temperature, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Summertime travel and increased social mixing because of social events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Spending time indoors to beat the heat: Respiratory viruses tend to spread more easily in environments with low humidity and cool temperatures. Air-conditioned spaces might not have adequate ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Waning immunity from vaccination and previous infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Mutations: As the virus spreads, it acquires mutations that allow it to evade our existing immunity. Eventually, a version of the virus collects enough mutations that it has a slight edge over other viruses, and if other factors line up, it can sweep through a population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-the-numbers-show" class="subhead"&gt;What do the numbers show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which coronavirus tests in California came back positive was 11.59% for the week ending Aug. 16. That’s up from a positive test rate of 5.69% for the week ending July 19, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/RespiratoryVirusReport.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;California Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The positive test rate is expected to further increase in the coming weeks, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID-19 test positivity this summer looks similar to [the] summer of 2023 so far,” the department said. That year saw the summer COVID wave &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-10-10/l-a-countys-covid-19-summer-bump-is-declining"&gt;peak in early September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, which saw &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-12/why-is-covid-still-surging-in-california-a-midsummer-mutation-may-be-to-blame"&gt;the largest summer spike since 2022&lt;/a&gt;, COVID activity maxed out in early August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is also increasingly a reason why people are seeking urgent medical care. For the week ending Aug. 17, COVID diagnosis was the &lt;a class="link" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#ed-visits_separated_by_age_group" target="_blank"&gt;reason&lt;/a&gt; why 4.04% of children in California up to age 11 were in the emergency room — up from 1.02% during the last week in June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID was the reason why 2.25% of people age 75 and older were in the emergency room over the same period, up from 1.13% during the last week of June, state data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-what-the-pandemic-emergency-is-over" class="subhead"&gt;So what? The pandemic emergency is over&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise in COVID comes as the disease has receded as a major worry from the minds of many, with fewer people getting annual COVID vaccines and even fewer wearing masks in any setting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, COVID can result in significant illness — a “razor blade” sore throat and miserable cough for some and hospitalization and even &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; for the very young, very old and chronically ill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="link" href="https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Preliminary-2024-2025-U-S-COVID-19-Burden-Estimate/ahrf-yqdt/about_data" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that at least 38,000 have &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/burden-estimates.html" target="_blank"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; from COVID-19 for the season that began Oct. 1. During the same period, the CDC estimates the number of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;flu deaths&lt;/a&gt; to be at least 27,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time,&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-02/how-common-is-long-covid-a-new-study-provides-fresh-clues"&gt; long COVID &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-02-14/risk-for-chronic-fatigue-soars-among-covid-19-patients-study-says"&gt;other related impacts&lt;/a&gt; of the coronavirus remain major issues for &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/long-covid/php/scientific-approach/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;millions.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-vaccine-numbers-like" class="subhead"&gt;What are the vaccine numbers like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 14.7% of California’s population has received the updated COVID-19 vaccine that first became &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2024-08-22/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-vaccines-shots-should-be-available-in-days"&gt;available nearly a year ago&lt;/a&gt;. Uptake was greatest among the oldest Californians, with 37.2% of state seniors age 65 and up getting the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those ages 50 to 64, 17.7% have gotten their shot, as have 9.5% of younger adults ages 18 to 49. Among children ages 5 to 11, 5.9% have been vaccinated, and for those younger than 5, 3.2% have been vaccinated with the latest COVID-19 vaccine formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health continues to recommend that everyone age 6 months and older stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is particularly important for higher-risk individuals, such as infants and toddlers, pregnant individuals, older persons, and others with risks for serious disease,” the department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department’s advice resembles the CDC’s past guidance, which has changed since the start of the second Trump administration and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-02-13/robert-f-kennedy-jr-confirmed-health-human-services"&gt;the appointment of&lt;/a&gt; vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head the CDC’s parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC now says it offers “no guidance” as to whether healthy pregnant women should get the COVID vaccine, and asks parents of healthy children to talk with a healthcare provider before getting the COVID vaccine for their youngsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream medical organizations, like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, continue to recommend that people receive the updated COVID-19 vaccine at any point during pregnancy. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends infants and children ages 6 months to 23 months get the updated COVID vaccine, since they are at high risk of severe illness should they get COVID, and that the vaccine should be offered for children age 2 and older if their parent wishes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some doctors, including Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert, have suggested that people who haven’t been vaccinated in more than a year, and are at risk for severe complications should they get COVID, get vaccinated with the currently available shots now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong noted that the 2025-26 version of the COVID vaccine should be “relatively the same formula” as the 2024-25 version. “It’s less important to wait,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eligibility for the new vaccine has been delayed by the Trump administration, and it isn’t clear when it’ll become available or who will be eligible outside of older people and those with chronic health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some pharmacy chains and health providers have paused online scheduling of appointments for COVID-19 vaccines until the 2025-26 version is released, presumably later this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at least one chain, CVS, says all of its pharmacies nationwide offer the 2024-25 version of the COVID-19 vaccine and that it is available on a walk-in basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All CVS Pharmacy locations across the U.S. currently offer the COVID-19 vaccine. We’ll continue to offer to eligible patients, as determined by the [Food and Drug Administration] and CDC, until an updated 2025-2026 vaccine is released,” CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault said in a statement to The Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Digital vaccination scheduling is paused temporarily, but we are still offering walk-in COVID-19 vaccinations,” Thibault said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-might-the-rest-of-the-summer-look-like" class="subhead"&gt;What might the rest of the summer look like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials note that the spread of COVID appears to be less severe this summer compared to last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across California, levels of the coronavirus detected in wastewater are about 20% lower than the peak of the 2023 summer wave, and about 50% below the height of the 2024 summer wave, the state Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this time of year, COVID hospitalizations are currently considered low, based off thresholds “established from the data from the past five seasons,” the department said. “Deaths are also lower than previous seasons.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-can-i-do-to-protect-myself" class="subhead"&gt;What can I do to protect myself?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some steps those concerned about COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases can take: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Get vaccinated now, especially if you’re at higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19 and haven’t received a vaccine in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• If you do get sick with COVID-19, talk with a medical provider about getting &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-01-28/paxlovid-anitivirals-for-many-should-be-easier-to-get-heres-what-to-know"&gt;an anti-COVID drug like Paxlovid&lt;/a&gt;, which can reduce the duration of illness and alleviate symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Stay away from sick people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Wear a well-fitting mask, like a KF94 or an N95, in indoor public settings — or perhaps at least carry one with you if you’re traveling, so you can wear it if someone is coughing on a plane. “Now’s a good time to mask in indoor public places if you’re in a high-risk group,” wrote Dr. Matt Willis, former public health officer for Marin County, on the “Your Local Epidemiologist in California” &lt;a class="link" href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-171508787" target="_blank"&gt;blog.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Optimize indoor air quality — opening a window helps!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Test if you’re ill with COVID-like symptoms or have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here’s some advice about flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Health officials recommend everyone age 6 months and older get the flu shot for the upcoming season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The vaccine for RSV is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; for all adults age 75 and older and those ages 50 to 74 who are at increased risk for RSV. People who have already received the RSV vaccine in recent years don’t need another dose at this time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/hcp/vaccine-clinical-guidance/pregnant-people.html" target="_blank"&gt;Pregnant&lt;/a&gt; women should also get a single dose of an RSV vaccine during weeks 32 through 36 of their pregnancy, sometime between September through January.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPekQzRDhsTHJrdTJqOTY2UzlRRHlvaV9aMm5HbzI5TWU1TThtZVVTZTZXTWRkODBFWl93LUs5aWZQYjNsN3FJV3NIS1VvZkhTWEZ1cjB0VjNpdl9rczRsNGxMMGNLN1ptOE5pOTNGZkw5Vy1CUVA1Ml8xRWxPQ2Y0WTRWd243V3RGdjJoU0FwSzlNMFc3MzlqNFJMNVZMbDVmYkhMaG5ZOA</guid></item><item><title>诊断困境：罕见病使女性将人视为龙- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/diagnostic-dilemma-rare-condition-made-a-woman-see-people-as-dragons</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

These hallucinations were disturbing and affected her ability to interact with people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="8c30c2e3-d5d1-4519-94ab-9326eaa00f07-2"&gt;The patient reported that human faces that seemed normal at first "turned black, grew long, pointy ears and a protruding snout, and displayed a reptiloid skin and huge eyes in bright yellow, green, blue, or red," doctors wrote &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2961690-1/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2961690-1/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of her case.

All of the results were normal. However, an MRI of the patient's brain showed several lesions near the lentiform nucleus. Damage to this part of the brain has been &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8566813/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8566813/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linked to cognitive impairments&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as issues with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/cognitive-impairment-in-schizophrenia/E8374E67E84DFD78738923A31CF75A5E" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/cognitive-impairment-in-schizophrenia/E8374E67E84DFD78738923A31CF75A5E" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;attention and memory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, particularly associated with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These lesions — which appeared in the insulated wiring of the brain, called white matter — may have been caused by ruptures in small blood vessels in the brain. But the damage was not recent, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the EEG did not reveal any abnormalities, the doctors suspected that the patient's visual hallucinations were caused by atypical electrical activity in parts of the brain that process colors and faces — specifically, the ventral occipitotemporal cortex. This region, located in the back of the brain, is involved in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8260247/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8260247/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;regulating object recognition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

This uncommon condition affects how a person perceives human faces, making facial features appear dramatically distorted. Features may seem enlarged or shrunken; they may sag, stretch sideways or drift out of position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zS5JKXrWByWWY4Lk7S3WzD" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zS5JKXrWByWWY4Lk7S3WzD slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://prosopometamorphopsia.faceblind.org/hemipmo/" target="_blank" data-url="https://prosopometamorphopsia.faceblind.org/hemipmo/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hemi-prosopometamorphopsia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or hemi-PMO, just one side of the observed face is affected. In full-face prosopometamorphopsia, or full-face PMO, distortion warps the entire face a person sees. The condition is associated with changes to brain structure and with disorders that affect brain function, such as epilepsy, migraine and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b21a1a75-03de-4c56-a3e0-6fcd7944b226"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The doctors prescribed the patient daily doses of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682412.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682412.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;valproic acid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an anticonvulsant that prevents seizures and also alleviates migraines and symptoms of bipolar disorder. The treatment brought the woman's visual hallucinations under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she then began experiencing hallucinations of banging sounds in her sleep. The doctors switched her to a daily regimen of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/20352-rivastigmine-capsules" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/20352-rivastigmine-capsules" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rivastigmine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a drug that is commonly used to treat symptoms of dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. The drug made these auditory hallucinations less frequent and reduced her visual symptoms to a manageable level. After three years of this treatment, the woman reported that her work situation had stabilized and her social relationships had improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Prosopometamorphopsia is exceptionally rare, with only 81 cases described in the medical literature over the past 100 years, according to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33865569/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33865569/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a 2021 review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people who experience this condition, its distorting effect on human faces lasts just a few days or weeks. PMO-triggered distortions have been known to make &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00136-3/abstract" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00136-3/abstract" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;people's faces appear "demonic"&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — but in the woman's case, it's unclear exactly what caused her highly specific perception of reptilian dragons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-zS5JKXrWByWWY4Lk7S3WzD-UwqIvBA8Pk9mB7Cb6sbVwqwdSRrQFeBi" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-zS5JKXrWByWWY4Lk7S3WzD-UwqIvBA8Pk9mB7Cb6sbVwqwdSRrQFeBi slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For the past few years, a small team of health scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been tasked with answering basic statistical questions like: Who is drowning? Where is it happening — in lakes, rivers, swimming pools? And what works to prevent it?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team was starting to answer some of those questions when it was put on administrative leave in April, according to two former CDC officials familiar with the program. They requested that NPR not use their names because they fear retaliation from the Trump administration for speaking to the media.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Now, those results may not come to light, since the Trump administration terminated the CDC's drowning prevention experts this month and has proposed eliminating the program in its &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-resources/budget/the-presidents-fy-2026-discretionary-budget-request/" target="_blank"&gt;fiscal year 2026 budget request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If this program saved one life, it would be far more than the total cost of the program," says Jim Mercy, former director of the Division of Violence Prevention at the CDC, who retired in 2023. "The irony is that these and other programs [at the CDC] were cut under the motivation of creating greater &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/" target="_blank"&gt;efficiency&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Drowning kills &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drowning/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;more than 4,000 people&lt;/a&gt; each year in the United States. It's the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drowning/data-research/facts/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;leading cause of death&lt;/a&gt; among children ages 1 to 4 and is one of the top causes of death among children ages 5 to 14. A single drowning costs &lt;a href="https://wisqars.cdc.gov/cost/" target="_blank"&gt;millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; in terms of medical costs and societal loss, Mercy says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's drowning prevention program was created in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7320e1.htm?s_cid=mm7320e1_w" target="_blank"&gt;spike in drowning deaths&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic. "After the pandemic, quite a few organizations came together to drive some possibilities of federally focused work on drowning prevention," says &lt;a href="https://ndpa.org/lindsay-a-mondick/" target="_blank"&gt;Lindsay Mondick&lt;/a&gt;, director of aquatic strategy and quality practices for the &lt;a href="https://www.ymca.org/" target="_blank"&gt;YMCA of the USA&lt;/a&gt;, and a longtime water safety advocate. "CDC was a natural fit — not only do they do data science, but they also look at intervention strategies and programs."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Drowning is largely preventable and costs the U.S. economy over &lt;a href="https://ndpa.org/drowning-facts-and-data/" target="_blank"&gt;$50 billion a year&lt;/a&gt;. The CDC's efforts had been focused in two areas: determining the risk factors around drowning and what works to prevent drownings, to reduce the likelihood that children die from drowning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The drowning prevention team worked with partners like the YMCA, the Red Cross and the National Center for Fatality Review and Prevention to help collect and evaluate data, as well as teach children to swim.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Work with YMCA&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The YMCA has a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drowning/partners/ymca.html" target="_blank"&gt;water safety approach&lt;/a&gt; it has been using for around a decade. "It's focused on developing skills for swimming and water competency — skills that keep people safe if they were to have accidents or find themselves in an unpredictable situation," Mondick says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, the CDC helped it collect data to figure out what was working. "One of the things we were most excited about with this funding is the YMCA was able to build, I think, what is probably the largest drowning data collection hub," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As part of the process, the CDC provided funding for free swim lessons for thousands of kids at high risk of drowning. This included children from &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/drowning/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;some minority groups&lt;/a&gt; and those on the autism spectrum, who are 160 times more likely than their peers to die from drowning, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/individuals-autism-substantially-heightened-risk-injury-death" target="_blank"&gt;study from Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For a kid with special sensory needs, not only are their senses being challenged because of just water, but it's noisy and it's hot and it's all the things," says &lt;a href="https://ymcadallas.org/leadership" target="_blank"&gt;Jennifer Pewitt&lt;/a&gt;, who oversees swim programs for the YMCA in the Dallas metro area.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At one facility, swim instructors received specialized training on connecting with kids on the autism spectrum. When parents heard they were running this program, they came from all over Dallas County. "There is a huge community need," Pewitt says. "There have been some really awesome stories that have come out of it. And there's been some misses."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That's the learning process, Pewitt says. The whole time, they collected data with guidance from the CDC. "The Y doesn't employ epidemiologists — that is not a thing," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The goal was to figure out how to best teach kids at high risk of drowning to swim and reduce their risks around water, and to share those lessons widely. "That's where the magic happens — if what worked with these kids can be replicated," Pewitt says. "That was the whole point of it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Potential impact&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC program employed three health scientists and had a $2 million annual budget, most of which was disbursed to partner organizations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a very small program, but very important," Mercy, formerly with the CDC, says, adding that the program had strong bipartisan support when it started receiving congressional funding a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Especially in small towns, cutting off the CDC funding would be a big loss, says Pewitt. "It's really sad that there isn't going to be those opportunities for those small Y's to serve the kids in their communities."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s not true,” said Robin Murray, a professor of psychiatric research at King’s College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What we can show in this study is that the effect of cannabis is a bit like the effect of alcohol or the effect of food, that it’s a dimension. So the more you take, the more problems you get into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Contrary to what it says on the internet, cannabis is not medicinal. We now have 40 private clinics up and down the UK dishing out cannabis supposedly as a treatment, and the things that they are giving it for are pain, anxiety and depression predominantly. And these are the things that we find are related to people getting into trouble and becoming more paranoid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Emily Finch, the chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ addiction faculty, said: “These important findings reinforce previous work which suggests that cannabis can have significant adverse effects on users’ mental health. Society must be more aware of the substantial evidence on cannabis harms, and correct the widespread misapprehension that cannabis is not an addictive substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in the UK, and around a third of people who use cannabis develop a problem with the drug at some point during their lives. This is similar to the proportion of people who will develop a problem with alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The use of both natural and ‘synthetic’ cannabinoids over the long term risks addiction and severe co-occurring mental illness harms. Daily cannabis use is associated with depression, anxiety and reduced motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Daily users of high-potency cannabis are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than people who have never used cannabis, with adolescents at particular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“As a priority, the UK government must provide substance use and mental health services with the training, staff and funding they need to support people with co-occurring substance use and mental illness. This must also include a focus on providing early treatment to the increasing number of children and young people struggling with substance misuse if we are to reduce long-term harms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A separate study published in the journal Psychological Medicine analysed the same survey, and found 52% of cannabis users had experienced some kind of childhood trauma, and that those who had experienced physical and emotional abuse had paranoia scores around 35-40% higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Respondents who reported experiencing sexual abuse as a child consumed more THC on average, followed by those who had experienced physical and emotional abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 08:54:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxQWEtNdzBROGhGaXBpUXBaTy1VOUxBNEp1Z0ZveUYxZFJFU3NZX19UWVZSNlQ0MmdGenN2LUVmNXNTWXBaMlE4dVVFdkJSMkZoTFYzTlptTmNHWEVKaHNIYVlGdDlPcG82YU41bFFpWTd4NmFfTi1BMkd2aU9EbFFCZTJpbVFGSEdudVFLOWliRFhXODhCb2lXdGFfaXZsM3ljdmZreXVJQzJ0TF9iWTFhQW9zMktoWDI2eUxyQzJpR0ViS3d3</guid></item></channel></rss>
