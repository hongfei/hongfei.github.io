                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tree ring data enabled Büntgen et al. to determine that there had been a volcanic eruption (or a cluster of eruptions) around 1345, specifically so-called “blue rings” that indicate unusually cold or wet summers—in this case, for three consecutive years (1345, 1346, and 1347). The textual sources also referenced details like an unusually high degree of cloudiness and darkened lunar eclipses, indications of the after-effects of volcanic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That colder climate in turn led to widespread crop failures and associated famine, particularly in parts of Spain, southern France, Egypt, and northern and central Italy. While Milan and Rome were largely self-sufficient, per the authors, smaller urban centers like Bologna, Florence, Genoa, Siena, and Venice relied on a complex grain supply system to import grain from the Mongols of the Golden Horde via established trade routes along the Black Sea coast. Textual evidence supports this, showing substantial price hikes for cereals and the imposition of grain trade regulations in 1346. This saved people from starvation but also brought Y. pestis along for the ride, with devastating consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per the authors, while the factors that triggered the spread of the Black Death to Europe are unique, the study illustrates the risks of a globalized world and calls for a similar interdisciplinary approach to future threats. “Although the coincidence of factors that contributed to the Black Death seems rare, the probability of zoonotic diseases emerging under climate change and translating into pandemics is likely to increase in a globalized world,” &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1107493?"&gt;said Büntgen&lt;/a&gt;. “This is especially relevant given our recent experiences with COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;

While they’ve been building an autism awareness and acceptance movement for decades, advocates are shifting focus to combat rhetoric that could set progress back. They’re speaking out more than ever before, with groups joining together to launch months-long communications campaigns to keep families confident in science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our community looks to us to give them the facts,” said Maria Davis-Pierre, an autistic licensed mental health therapist and the founder of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/autism" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Autism&lt;/a&gt; in Black, an organization that calls attention to racial disparities in autism diagnosis and care. “We have to constantly refute RFK’s information since we know that misinformation will harm our community more than any other community out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f23c6f36-5420-4ce6-805c-6582ecb19aa4" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Autism in Black Conference 2025, founder Maria Davis-Pierre&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of Autism in Black&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="fighting-misinformation-is-at-the-movements-core" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Fighting misinformation is at the movement’s core&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Though autism spectrum disorder was first identified in the 1940s, advocates still spend an outsized amount of time educating the public about what autism is and isn’t – a role that’s only grown more challenging in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Autism is a developmental condition that affects how someone communicates and behaves, encompassing those who can live independently and others who need support due to severe symptoms such as language and functional impairments. In the 1980s, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) identified diagnostic criteria for autism, but the movement for autism recognition faced a major hurdle in the 1990s, when a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3136032/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;medical paper&lt;/a&gt; implied a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and autism. The study, which looked at 12 children who received the vaccine – eight of whom were said to develop autism – was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2908388/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;retracted in 2010&lt;/a&gt; for insufficient evidence, among other problems. Since then, &lt;a href="https://www.vaccinesafety.edu/do-vaccines-cause-autism/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;large epidemiological studies&lt;/a&gt; on various vaccines have found no relationship between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet the idea that vaccines cause autism persists, with Kennedy breathing new life into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When [Kennedy] says something appalling, we get a week or two where all I can do is answer press inquiries because that’s how many we’re getting. It becomes my whole job,” Gross said. “It’s disappointing to have to fight the same stuff we were fighting when I came into autism advocacy 15 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The ASAN has released dozens of statements over the past few months in response to the administration, with materials in plain language and picture-assisted format to reach people with varying accessibility needs. The Autism Science Foundation, which funds research about autism’s causes and treatments, has even partnered with the American Academy of Pediatrics to design infographics and tools to illustrate to families that vaccines do not cause autism. “We’re having to go backwards and reassure parents,” said Alycia Halladay, the organization’s chief science officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fbb7c4a0-b017-4a5d-a891-3e2b2cbdd332" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Robert F Kennedy JR at a hearing in Washington in September.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Since Kennedy was confirmed, the administration has repeatedly framed autism as a chronic disease that needs to be “&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-establishes-the-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt;”, though autism is a neurological and developmental disorder and not something to be cured, advocates and researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In April, when the CDC released its biennial &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/ss/ss7402a1.htm?s_cid=ss7402a1_w" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; about autism prevalence in children, Kennedy called the rise in children with autism – from 1 in 36 in 2020 to 1 in 31 in 2022 and from &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/autism-epidemic-runs-rampant-new-data-shows-grants.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;1 in 150 in 2000&lt;/a&gt; – “alarming” and a sign that “the epidemic is real”. Though the CDC report stated that the rise is a result of better autism screening, wider diagnosis parameters and greater access to services, Kennedy refuted the findings, saying the increase was due to “environmental toxins”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Advocates again doubled down on storytelling and education to counter Kennedy’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For example, leaders at Autism Empowerment not only shared evidence-based information on social media, but also helped autistic adults share their stories through the autistic-led publication &lt;a href="http://www.spectrumlife.org/currentissue" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Spectrum Life Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, community outreach events and other programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Then, when Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-autism-study-medical-records/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pledged &lt;/a&gt;to create a national autism database to find the causes of autism, advocates pushed back with a Change.org &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/05/autism-national-database-rfk-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; that garnered nearly 50,000 signatures. Opponents explained that Kennedy’s vague plan for a registry could turn into a means for the government to track autistic people and restrict their ability to participate in society.&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Three days later, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://newschannel9.com/news/local/us-health-department-denies-plans-for-autism-registry-despite-nih-directors-comments-us-secretary-of-health-and-human-services-robert-f-kennedy-junior-president-donald-trump-health-mental-health-asd" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reversed course&lt;/a&gt;. Advocates believe the public outcry influenced his decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“To speak as though our existence is some kind of calamity that must be eliminated is a form of eugenics – the dangerous ideology based on the idea that ‘some people are born to be a burden on the rest,’” the ASAN wrote in a statement. “Such ideas led directly to disabled people being incarcerated and forcibly sterilized in this country, and murdered in Nazi Germany, and it is profoundly disturbing to see this administration bringing back yet another hallmark of authoritarian policy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In September, when Trump and Kennedy claimed that &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/autism-announcement-fact-sheet.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;taking acetaminophen during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; leads to autism, Davis-Pierre was quick to share local resources that would actually help families. Davis-Pierre is familiar with being misled and shut out when trying to navigate support networks – she was diagnosed later in life and led a weeklong sit-in at the pediatric neurologist’s office to get her child’s autism diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The fear-mongering will lead to gaps in diagnosis that we have been trying to bridge when it comes to the Black community. People are scared now,” said Davis-Pierre. “While I would love for this administration to take accountability, I think we’re just going to have to buckle in for the rest of this term and understand that our community must work hard to refute this misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="autistic-people-need-more-resources-so-advocates-are-leaning-into-politics" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Autistic people need more resources – so advocates are leaning into politics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Significant challenges remain in improving quality of life for autistic people. Autistic children and adults face limited access to health and wellness assistance, long waitlists for diagnosis and services, and shorter life expectancy. They also face barriers to &lt;a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/resources/employment/#:~:text=National%20data%20has%20shown%20that,with%20intellectual%20and%20developmental%20disabilities." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;employment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://autismsociety.org/resources/housing/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;housing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.30.21254339v1.full" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;food security&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To address these issues, advocates want to shift the government’s focus away from pouring money into disproven theories and toward tangible efforts that help autistic people in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Autism Society of Greater New Orleans has seen success with boosting vaccine confidence and access among autistic people through a multi-pronged approach. During the program’s peak in 2023, the organization vaccinated 2,029 people, exceeding their goal of 600. They also trained 300 medical professionals on how to better administer vaccines and make sensory environments more comfortable for people with autism, since many practitioners in the area did not have specialized knowledge. The organization has also developed and distributed more than 1,000 vaccine kits for autistic people, which included headphones, sunglasses, fidgets, and shock blockers, to help reduce the pain of getting a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="af5162c0-f864-4b26-9a2e-dc6a3c7c07b6" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A vaccination event at the Autism Society of Greater New Orleans.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of Autism Society of Greater New Orleans&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People told us that the kits completely changed their experiences with vaccines,” said Claire Tibbetts, the chapter’s executive director. “Children and adults with autism had less fear and anxiety around the physical experience of getting vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The organization, like many autism advocacy groups, has also turned to advocating for better-funded services, early intervention and early diagnosis. In the Greater New Orleans area, patients on Medicaid must wait two years for an autism diagnosis, since there are few providers who take Medicaid and offer the test, Tibbetts said. One national &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5583718/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found the average wait time to schedule an appointment to be about three months, a figure advocates and medical professionals say is too long.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Without a diagnosis, autistic people can’t access developmental disability services, including in-home professional support, child care or respite care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Advocates also plan to put more pressure on elected officials, with some organizations calling for Kennedy’s removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During Trump’s first term and Biden’s presidency, advocates regularly communicated with the health department, but a sudden communications freeze in January, as Trump appointees &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/01/trump-health-agency-layoffs-cuts" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;laid off thousands&lt;/a&gt; of staffers at the agency, meant they no longer had a seat at the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We have requested meetings with HHS staff and hope we can get those meetings so that we can engage directly with people both at the NIH and CDC about the vaccine question and other questions pertaining to responsible autism research,” said Jill Escher, the president of the National Council on Severe Autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other advocates have made their way to Capitol Hill. Tonya Haynes, an advocate with Autism Speaks, accompanies her 25-year-old autistic son, &lt;a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/blog/video-thriving-autism" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Tyler&lt;/a&gt;, to deliver speeches about his experience graduating from college and being employed&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s one thing to read about Tyler’s story or to be told about Tyler’s story, but when individuals are able to see Tyler in person, the impact is instant,” said Haynes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When the Senate voted to confirm Kennedy as health secretary, Louisiana Republican senator Bill Cassidy cast the deciding vote, though he expressed major concern over Kennedy’s anti-vaccination activism. To reassure Cassidy, Kennedy made several concessions – including leaving intact the CDC webpage that states vaccines do not cause autism. Now that Kennedy has breached that promise, Cassidy has &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/23/bill-cassidy-refuses-to-speak-against-rfk-jr-00666410" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;expressed shock&lt;/a&gt; but has refused to directly challenge Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As one of Cassidy’s constituents, Tibbetts said she and her team repeatedly meet with Cassidy’s office to share information about vaccines and autism – something they will continue to do as long as misinformation is spread. “Framing autism as some kind of disease that needs to be eradicated is harmful,” she said. “It hurts autistic people living their lives right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBXa2lLOHBLaFZoRjREOUh2VnlweWVzTWJWWS1faWlPQUpCTEpzSEVWN3BOUUV1Rlc3UDNIeGZPZTdza0pJYmI0ektDTGM3a2x3akdxemc2UjYxakxZUGFCR1JSbEU0aC10bTZTa0NsQmRWQnFWUVFnTmZyUU9rTXc</guid></item><item><title>为所有新生儿注射乙型肝炎疫苗--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/05/health/kennedy-vaccine-committee-vote-hepatitisb.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 15:35:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPVG5IU3hDSTN4Q2k1U0FqaGJLOW94cDRjdlJVRjh0ZXlCVkEtNDJtWkZvbTFwX3FXVGw4N1kybnFTTjczOGZvMUJLZUh3ald3bGVwcDRrUVBwZVBiQ1JCLVlQNFVWSTY3bnU4TXB0N2tac0pzZmQ3Q3UtODlCS09PbG8xVklKaVZoYVdsQWJiZVA3dw</guid></item><item><title>医生警告对抗鼻塞的病毒趋势—这实际上会使症状恶化-纽约邮报</title><link>https://nypost.com/2025/12/05/health/doctor-warns-against-viral-trend-for-fighting-a-stuffed-nose/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom"&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;It’s snot a good idea — no matter what TikTok tells you. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the message from doctors about a viral at-home trend for unclogging stuffed noses, warning it could leave cold and flu sufferers even more miserable than before. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Please don’t do this,” Dr. Madeleine Herman, physician president at the &lt;a href="https://www.scenthouston.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sinus Center &amp;amp; ENT Specialists of Houston&lt;/a&gt;, told The Post. “Not only is it ineffective, but it can actually make symptoms worse.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cold and flu season in the US typically runs from October until February.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Xavier Lorenzo – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On TikTok, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hwannah5/video/6977720100862430469" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;viral videos&lt;/a&gt; show people jamming whole cloves of raw garlic up their schnozes for 10 to 15 minutes before pulling them out, unleashing a flood of thick mucus to their disgusting delight.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media users say the stunt can &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@siuwupeepoo/video/6980067472951053573"&gt;open up clogged sinuses&lt;/a&gt; and act as a remedy for congestion when traditional methods fail. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But don’t be fooled by all the snot. While garlic does have &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/27/health/is-garlic-really-that-good-for-your-health-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;some health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, Herman said the hack can seriously backfire. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“The dramatic mucus drainage people see after removing the garlic happens for two reasons,” she explained. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, the mucus has been building up behind the blockage and simply rushes out once the garlic is removed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, the strong compounds in garlic irritate the nasal lining, prompting the nose to churn out even more mucus in an attempt to “flush out” the irritant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Social media users are sticking cloves up their nose. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TikTok / @siuwupeepoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;When they pull the garlic out, it’s often followed by a trail of snot. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TikTok / @hwannah5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, the torrent of snot you see streaming from TikTokers’ noses isn’t a sign of healing — it’s a reaction to irritation. That irritation can trap existing mucus, making congestion feel even worse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Herman added that shoving raw garlic up your nose carries real, potentially painful risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The active compounds in garlic can cause chemical burns when applied to the skin or mucous membranes,” she cautioned.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Garlic has medicinal properties, but health experts say you won’t reap any by shoving it up your nose.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;yanadjan – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This can cause the delicate tissues inside your nose to bleed, especially with repeated attempts, and may even trigger a rash or leave lasting scars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Leaving a foreign object in the nose for too long can also lead to infection,” she warned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sticking a garlic clove up your nose can introduce harmful microbes into the delicate nasal cavity. Combined with irritation, this creates a damp environment where bacteria are able to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result: a painful &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/27/health/ive-had-a-7-year-infection-since-my-ex-farted-in-my-face/"&gt;sinus infection&lt;/a&gt; and other complications. There’s also a risk the clove could get stuck or break apart, potentially requiring a doctor to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trend comes as cold and flu season is in full swing across the US, leaving Americans sniffling, sneezing and searching for a solution to clear up congestion. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to breathe freely, doctors recommend skipping the garlic and and sticking to proven methods for treating a cold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Colds are usually self-limited viral infections,” Dr. Raj Sindwani, an otolaryngologist, told the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/putting-garlic-in-nose-to-clear-sinuses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s best to treat them holistically with rest, hydration and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/07/health/2-major-mistakes-many-people-make-when-using-nasal-spray/"&gt;nasal sprays&lt;/a&gt; or irrigations with saline.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over-the-counter &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/nasal-decongestant-hacks-shared-after-unsound-drugs-exposed/"&gt;nasal decongestants&lt;/a&gt; containing ingredients like pseudoephedrine can also help, while pain relievers such as acetaminophen may ease sinus pressure and pain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Placing a warm, damp cloth over the nose and forehead may soothe discomfort, and adding a humidifier to your room can helps keep nasal passages from drying out.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/10/shopping/congested-save-on-shower-steamers-on-amazon-for-fast-relief/"&gt;Inhaling steam from a hot shower&lt;/a&gt; or a bowl of water can also help loosen mucus and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if your cold lasts more than 10 days, worsens after initially improving or comes with severe symptoms like high fever, chest pain or difficulty breathing, experts say you should see a doctor to rule out something more serious. &lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quanta&lt;/em&gt; spoke to Fedorenko about how the language network is like the digestive system, what she knows about how the language decoder works, and whether she really believes that people have LLMs inside their heads. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the language network?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a core set of areas in adult brains that acts as an interconnected system for computing linguistic structure. They store the mappings between words and meanings, and rules for how to put words together. When you learn a language, that’s what you learn: You learn these mappings and the rules. And that allows us to use this “code” in incredibly flexible ways. You can convert between a thought and a word sequence in any language that you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="post__aside mb2 relative post__aside--right"&gt;&lt;figure class="mb2 mt1 image--shortcode s:mt-0"&gt;
    
            &lt;figcaption class="image__meta mt1"&gt;
                            &lt;div class="caption wysiwyg h5 theme__anchors--solid fill-h post__aside__caption post__aside__caption--shortcode"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Three brain models in Fedorenko’s office highlight the language network. From top: in purple, embroidery by Laura Bundesen; in red, cross-stitch by Hannah Small; in red, 3D-printed model.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Katherine Taylor for &lt;em&gt;Quanta Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That sounds very abstract. But you call the language network a “natural kind” — does that mean it’s something physical you can point to, like the digestive system?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly right. These systems that people have discovered [in the brain], including the language network and some parts of the visual system, are like organs. For example, the fusiform face area is a natural kind: It’s meaningfully definable as a unit. In the language network, there are basically three areas in the frontal cortex in most people. All three of them are on the side of the left frontal lobe. There’s also a couple of areas that fall along the side of the middle temporal gyrus, this big hunk of meat that goes along the whole temporal lobe. Those are the core areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the unity in a few different ways. For example, if you put people in an [fMRI, or functional magnetic resonance imaging], scanner, you can look at responses to language versus some control condition. Those regions always go together. We’ve now scanned about 1,400 people, and we can build up a probabilistic map, which estimates where those regions will tend to be. The topography is a little bit variable across people, but the general patterns are very consistent. Somewhere within those broad frontal and temporal areas, everybody will have some tissue that is reliably doing linguistic computations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is this different from other parts of brain anatomy known to be associated with language, such as &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Broca-area"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broca’s area&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broca’s area is actually incredibly controversial. I would not call it a language region; it’s an articulatory motor-planning region. Right now, it’s being engaged to plan the movements of my mouth muscles in a way that allows me to say what I’m saying. But I could say a bunch of nonsense words, and it would be just as engaged. So it’s an area that takes some sound-level representation of speech and figures out the set of motor movements you would need [to produce it]. It’s a downstream region that the language network sends information to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve also &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/64c800a2f333f04f50bf2020/t/65bf955efc250c20c7fa4de2/1707054430395/fedorenko-research-sciam-june2023.pdf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;said&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; that language isn’t the same as thought. So if the language network isn’t producing speech, and it’s also not involved in thinking, what is it doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language network is basically an interface between lower-level perceptual and motor components and the higher-level, more abstract representations of meaning and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two things we do with language. In language production, you have this fuzzy thought, and then you have a vocabulary — not just of words, but larger constructions, and rules for how to connect them. You search through it to find a way to express the meaning you’re trying to convey using a structured sequence of words. Once you have that utterance, then you go to the motor system to say it out loud, write it or sign it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: I tend to run cold, especially in my hands and feet. Is that something to worry about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you get cold, it’s normal to first feel it in your fingers and toes. They’re farthest from the body’s core, where most heat is generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold hands and feet are usually nothing serious, said Dr. Nicholas Morrissey, a vascular surgeon at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York. But experts told us when a chill might signal a medical problem, and gave us their best tips for warming up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Why do hands and feet get cold? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our internal organs keep us warm when we’re sedentary, and our muscles become the primary source of heat when we’re active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there aren’t any organs or major muscles in hands and feet — just plenty of area for heat to escape and little insulation (or fat) to keep it in, said Stephen Cheung, a professor of kinesiology at Brock University in Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, hands and feet stay warm thanks to a dense web of tiny vessels that circulate blood from the heart. These vessels narrow in the cold, as your body tries to reduce heat loss and redirect the warm blood toward your vital organs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your brain says: ‘I can live without my hands and my feet. I can’t live without my heart, lungs, liver,’” Cheung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people can be more susceptible to cold hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, women generally feel colder than men because the blood vessels in their hands and feet tend to constrict more rapidly in the cold, said Mike Tipton, a professor of human and applied physiology at the University of Portsmouth in England. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children and people who are underweight also have less muscle mass and fat to generate and retain heat, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older people are at greater risk of having cold hands and feet as well, Tipton said, because their nerves and blood vessels tend to deteriorate over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; When is this a medical problem? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold hands and feet can sometimes signal more serious issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, about 5% of Americans have Raynaud’s syndrome, in which spasms of the arteries in the hands and feet, usually caused by cold or stress, temporarily cut off blood flow. This can cause the fingers and toes to change color, said Dr. Jessica Gordon, a rheumatologist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York — white and blue in lighter skin, or more yellow and purple in darker skin. While Raynaud’s is generally harmless, it can occasionally be caused by serious autoimmune diseases such as lupus or scleroderma, she added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other causes of cold hands and feet include clots in the arms and legs; peripheral artery disease, or the narrowing of vessels in the limbs; and nerve injuries, which can damage the body’s ability to sense temperature and control blood vessels, Morrissey said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypothyroidism and anemia can also cause cold hands and feet, as can certain medications such as stimulants, beta blockers and pseudoephedrine, said Dr. Neha Vyas, a family medicine physician at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say that you should see a doctor if cold hands or feet are a recent development or the cold feeling is suddenly more severe; if you feel intense pain; if you develop sores, scabs or ulcers on your fingers or toes; or if the cold feeling persists, even if you should otherwise be warm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What can I do to warm up? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping your whole body warm is the best way to protect against freezing toes and fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, before you step outside, layer up with a sweater, a wind-resistant jacket and a beanie. “If you can keep your core warm, the brain is going to be less selfish,” and less likely to cut off blood flow to your hands and feet, Cheung said. In fact, research suggests that, to keep your fingers warm and working, you’re better off heating your torso than your hands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to know when to peel those layers off, too. “Sweat destroys the insulation provided by clothing,” Tipton said, because it fills the tiny pockets of air that normally trap heat between the fabric and your skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding a warm cup of coffee can also offer temporary relief, and wearing gloves and thick socks can help you retain heat. But the best way to warm up is to increase your heart rate, Cheung said, whether that’s working out, walking a little faster or stepping in place. When you exercise, about 70% to 80% of the energy you burn is released as heat, and as your core warms up, your body pushes more blood to your hands and feet, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At home, experts recommend warming up with slow, gentle heat — think snuggling under a blanket — instead of a sudden blast, like running your hands under hot water. This slower approach is easier on your nerves and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold hands and feet can be uncomfortable, but the good news is that the solution is often small, commonsense adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They captured subtle changes even better than &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/medical-tech" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain imaging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain imaging&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior study author Dr. Cyrus Raji, associate professor of radiology and neurology at Washington University, noted that the progression of Alzheimer’s is "influenced by pathologies happening overall in the body, such as obesity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is critical to preserve brain health by optimizing &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:body health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;body health&lt;/a&gt; as well," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"It is critical to preserve brain health by optimizing body health as well," the lead researcher said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent clinical trials (EVOKE and EVOKE+) have explored whether GLP-1 drugs such as semaglutide (Ozempic) could slow cognitive decline in people already diagnosed with early Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the recent Evoke trials failed to show an effect of Ozempic for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia, our work should motivate &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:future trials;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;future trials&lt;/a&gt; to determine if this class of drugs can help prevent Alzheimer's by treating obesity earlier in life," Raji said. "Caretakers and clinicians are key partners in making such trials happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Download The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Here To Download The Fox News App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation of this research, according to Mohammadi, is the fact that not all body fat carries the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our prior work shows that belly fat, rather than fat under the skin, drives much of obesity’s impact on the brain," he said. "Future studies should distinguish between these fat types instead of treating obesity as a single category."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel, who was not involved in the research, said he considers this a "very important study."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this finding makes complete sense, because obesity leads directly to inflammation and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which provoke neuro inflammation — one of the pillars of Alzheimer's development," he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Other risk factors that often coincide with obesity — such as diabetes, hypertension and inflammation — may also contribute to Alzheimer's biomarker changes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did have some limitations, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sample was relatively small and specific, and may not represent the general population. Also, the BMI measurement can't distinguish between fat and muscle mass or reflect differences in fat distribution that may influence Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also relies on observational data, which can reveal associations but can't prove that obesity directly causes faster Alzheimer’s pathology, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other risk factors that often coincide with obesity — &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:such as diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;such as diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, hypertension and inflammation — may also contribute to Alzheimer's biomarker changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This initial research sparks the need for larger studies in more diverse populations with longer follow-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/alzheimers-risk-could-rise-common-condition-affecting-millions-study-finds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer's risk could rise with common condition affecting millions, study finds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer's risk could rise with common condition affecting millions, study finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 14:03:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQbVhUeFBuQjVaSHpYeVVCb1NyQnVaNjdGeU85eGQ4SlNoUTV5UEVzbGtLRjIyRHNCamdfZzhfUzhhR2dJZDcteGp4SFd5Y2s1VUhEMEl2ckZkeUJxR1RUcjNlUDZiNFE4eVl0TFRHWWRiNDV3WXBGU3V2U29abFVveTYtVQ</guid></item><item><title>进行尸体解剖的人分享了他们在尸体上看到的最有趣的事情，哇- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/laurengarafano/most-interesting-autopsies</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

Scanning the laminated menu, I recognize there is almost nothing that I’d have been willing to eat a year ago. Phosphorescent eggs fried on the griddle with some neutral oil? No thanks. A bowl of yogurt? Maybe — until I remember the preservatives and the mystery stabilizers with names too difficult to pronounce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first heard the term “seed oils” in the summer of 2021 on a popular contrarian podcast that gained traction during the pandemic for its anti-woke commentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seed oils are vegetable oils derived from plants like soybean, canola, sunflower, corn and safflower. Often found in salad dressings, and processed and fried foods, they’re used more frequently in many restaurants than olive oil or butter because of their lower costs, higher smoking points and neutral taste profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their idiosyncratic vocal fry, the hosts discussed a book by a doctor who had helped to launch the seed oil-free movement in the early 2000s. The doctor claimed seed oils were among the worst things you could put in your body because they supposedly caused inflammation, interfered with cellular function and contributed to chronic illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think much more about the podcast until a week later when I was sitting with 10 of my best friends in a dimly-lit restaurant on Henry Street for my birthday. I had ordered pancakes for dinner, but Jane, my friend sitting to my right, opted for crudite. Steam curled from the stack of buttery, fluffy pancakes on my plate, while a neatly assembled assortment of carrots, celery and peppers surrounded a bowl of hummus on hers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew that Jane had joined the seed oil-free “movement” a few months earlier, and we had talked about the podcast I’d heard, but I had no idea she was taking it so seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re crazy, Jane,” I laughed, staring incredulously at her plate of raw vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m telling you — I’ve never felt better. I’ve completely stopped getting period cramps and headaches,” she replied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, another friend whispered in my ear, “Jane is looking really thin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that birthday dinner, something in me began to shift. I still ate what I wanted, but not without a quiet calculation. Before each bite, a whisper crept in: &lt;em&gt;What’s in this? Should I be eating it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I slowly started to listen to that voice. Soon, Jane and I began to speak a shared language with our choices — one that signaled discipline, awareness and a subtle sense of moral high ground. Within months, I was severely limiting what I’d put into my body, but I was telling myself it was to protect my health. However, beneath my reasoning was a creeping fear. The more I heard about seed oils, additives and processed foods, the smaller my world became. My quest to “eat clean” gradually slipped into something more obsessive — something that bordered on orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6370446/#:~:text=Orthorexia%20nervosa%20is%20perhaps%20best,and%20poor%20quality%20of%20life." target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Orthorexia nervosa" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6900d013e4b0973a4c058752" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6370446/#:~:text=Orthorexia%20nervosa%20is%20perhaps%20best,and%20poor%20quality%20of%20life." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Orthorexia nervosa&lt;/a&gt;, a term introduced in the late 1990s, describes an extreme fixation on consuming only foods deemed pure, healthy or natural. While caring about nutrition isn’t necessarily harmful, orthorexia becomes dangerous when rigid food rules begin to dominate a person’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though not formally recognized in the DSM-5, orthorexia is receiving increased attention, especially as social media fuels disordered thinking and eating. A 2023 &lt;a href="https://jogh.org/2023/jogh-13-04087" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="meta-analysis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6900d013e4b0973a4c058752" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://jogh.org/2023/jogh-13-04087" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; shows symptoms of orthorexia are rising across genders. For men, restrictive eating is often linked to achieving ideal physical performance. For women, it’s more commonly tied to a desire for purity — eating in a way that feels clean and natural. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have played a major role in normalizing this anxiety by cloaking misinformation in the language of “wellness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Ilana Amselem"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Ilana Amselem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was disturbingly easy for me to fall into this world. It started with small, seemingly harmless choices. I bought a different brand of yogurt. I tried a new water filter. I skipped dining out. But over time, these tweaks accumulated into an identity. And the repetition, along with the sheer volume of content that continually reinforced the same messages, made it feel like the truth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, a 2017 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251592/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6900d013e4b0973a4c058752" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251592/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that nearly half of Instagram users following health food accounts showed signs of orthorexia. TikTok and other short-form video platforms have only amplified the reach of obsessive food messaging, turning personal anxiety into a cultural script.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s hard to pinpoint exactly what changed in the years that followed. After an intense breakup left me feeling unmoored, I turned to food as a way to reclaim control. Health, however I defined it, suddenly took center stage. With so much in my life up in the air, leaving my health to chance didn’t feel like a real option. I had no clue where I was headed or who I was becoming, so I clung to something I could manage: my meals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I mostly stopped eating in restaurants. My sisters thought that my stringent diet was bogus. I couldn’t disagree with them, because I literally did not know the facts. They would roll their eyes every time I exclaimed that a snack product was seed oil-free. I fell down a rabbit hole. I stopped touching receipts (due to forever chemicals). I bought a special water filter (to eliminate fluoride from my drinking water). I stopped drinking out of plastic bottles (to reduce my exposure to microplastics). I threw away my AirPods (bluetooth brain damage).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I worked out constantly on little food, running my body ragged trying to be the “healthiest version of myself.” I pushed my body to its limits chasing an illusion of wellness shaped by influencers who profited off my health anxiety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My Instagram feed became a relentless procession of wellness evangelists, each pushing their own supplement and preaching that everything else was toxic. If I wanted to be truly healthy, I needed to buy in. Americans now spend an estimated &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/tiktok-shopping-statistics/#:~:text=79.3%25%20of%20TikTok%20Shop%20sales,site%20for%20shopping%20in%202023." target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="$32 million" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6900d013e4b0973a4c058752" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/tiktok-shopping-statistics/#:~:text=79.3%25%20of%20TikTok%20Shop%20sales,site%20for%20shopping%20in%202023." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;$32 million&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; per day shopping on TikTok, with more than &lt;/span&gt;7&lt;span&gt;9% of purchases falling under health and beauty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This booming industry includes everything from vitamins and herbal tinctures to protein powders, drink mixes and adaptogenic gummies.

I lost nearly 30 pounds. And the truth is I thought I looked better. That’s the part I still struggle with. It’s hard to untangle the health anxiety from the thrill of being thin. I had never really cared before, but now that I was smaller, I liked it. My quest for purity and optimization quietly morphed into something more familiar and more insidious: a desire to keep looking the way I did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By September of 2024, my hair was falling out. I asked my friend, a dermatologist, what could be going on. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s probably just stress,” I reasoned. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You have lost a lot of weight, Ilana,” she responded. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At a party the following month, three friends, independently, mentioned my weight loss. It was obvious they’d talked about it behind my back, and the realization stung. What were they seeing that I couldn’t? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, their comments felt offhanded — there were no serious confrontations and nothing that felt like true concern. Though they noticed my weight loss, my eating habits had changed so gradually that even those closest to me barely registered how intense my restrictions had become.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, I started grad school, and I suddenly had to explain my eating habits to strangers at lunch. It was embarrassing. Unlike my friends, these new people hadn’t been slowly desensitized to what I was doing — or not doing. I started to examine the content on my feed with a new lens, and I began to scrutinize the videos in a way I hadn’t before. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The more I saw, the more uneasy I became. I wanted to escape the algorithm, so I began reading, at first out of defensiveness — desperate to validate what I already believed. I was hoping to find studies that confirmed everything I’d absorbed from social media: that seed oils were toxic, that fluoride was dangerous, that microplastics were slowly poisoning me. But the deeper I went, the harder it became to ignore the cracks in what I’d been told.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I combed through nutrition studies, public health reports, interviews with registered dietitians, and medical reviews. I tried to trace the origins of some of the most viral claims. Who first said seed oils were inflammatory? Why were certain additives labeled as carcinogens by influencers but deemed safe by every major health organization? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I started to realize that much of what I’d internalized had no grounding in science. The sources cited in wellness content were rarely peer-reviewed studies, and when legitimate research was referenced, it was often inconclusive, outdated, or so narrowly focused that drawing such sweeping conclusions felt irresponsible. When studies were cited, they were almost always stripped of context. The most alarming or sensational detail was pulled out, inflated, and repeated for maximum engagement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What stunned me, more than anything, was how thin the foundation was — how much of my belief system had been built on fragments, not facts. But when you’re inundated with content that insists you’re being poisoned by your food, your water, your environment — and that you’re being lied to by the organizations who are supposed to protect you — it starts to feel irresponsible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;to listen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Slowly, I started to let go. I saw a therapist and opened up about my eating habits. She helped me see that demonizing entire food groups was rarely productive and pushed me to eat foods I had previously deemed “unhealthy.” I ate out more. I let myself have a French fry now and then. However, it took time and significant energy to loosen the grip, and I’m still not entirely free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I can count on one hand the number of receipts I’ve touched in the past several years. I still hesitate before eating something greasy, wondering what long-term damage it might do. But I take a breath, acknowledge the thought, and try not to let it lead or linger. I’ve blocked the influencers I used to idolize and stopped scanning every ingredient list I encounter. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not easy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even now I still worry about what I’m putting in or near my body. But I’m trying to base my actions on science, not social media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I sit here in this diner, my legs sticking to the vinyl seat, the waitress drops off our food. I stare at the overcooked scrambled eggs, topped with square slices of glossy, plastic-looking &lt;/span&gt;American cheese&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This cannot be healthy,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; I think while taking a bite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some names and identifying details have been changed to protect the identity of individuals mentioned in this essay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ilana Amselem is a graduate student and journalist who often writes about art, architecture and pop culture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

The panel, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on how to use vaccines, had twice before postponed the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The shot is currently recommended for all infants within 24 hours of birth to prevent infection of hepatitis B, which can cause serious liver damage.

The advisory panel, hand-picked by Donald Trump’s controversial health secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, includes longtime anti-vaccine advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, himself a prominent anti-vaccine activist, has long pushed for delaying the shot. Experts say any change to the current hepatitis B vaccination recommended schedule could have significant and far-reaching consequences for childhood health in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In one pointed exchange on Thursday, Joseph Hibbeln, an ACIP member and psychiatrist and neuroscientist, asked: “Is there any specific evidence of harm of giving this vaccination before 30 days? Or is this speculation?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There is limited evidence about the long-term risk,” said Mark Blaxill, an author who has argued that vaccines cause autism and other conditions, and who was recently named senior adviser at the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“So this was speculation and limited evidence,” Hibbeln replied. “OK, got it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The advisory panel can only make recommendations to the head of the CDC, acting director Jim O’Neill. The previous director, Susan Monarez, was ousted by the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; in August after the White House claimed she was “not aligned” with the president’s agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Earlier this year, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/rfk-cdc-panel-vaccines-removed" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dismissed all 17 members&lt;/a&gt; of the advisory committee. He has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/11/rfk-jr-new-vaccine-advisers-panel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;replaced them&lt;/a&gt; with his own appointees, including several vaccine skeptics who align with Kennedy’s desire to overhaul – and possibly, in some cases, scrap – longstanding vaccination recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The panel’s membership changed again this week, when the health department announced that the committee’s most recent chair, Dr Martin Kulldorff, would depart for an official role within the agency. He was replaced by Dr Kirk Milhoan, a cardiologist who has been critical of the Covid vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Melody Schreiber contributed reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQdzQwcU9WTUV3QXl5MGlXTkJ4RWUyYVNieUpORi1DQ1RhdzMwSlZuRkYyc1Jua0ktOGhKVWlvRWdrRmJ6M2Z3UmJ1cllFa0pUQVJUaFExeFgwX1VseGlmQ2k3bklyQjlDSXZqTDNuSXllcDRSbkxOSmlhYnZBVnRoNW83LTZlOVQ1cXlF</guid></item><item><title>您真正应该知道的6种痴呆症身体症状- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/physical-symptoms-of-dementia_l_692f4f9ce4b017c8f3fac047</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting older comes with many changes, not the least of which are occasional memory lapses, which tend to worry many people in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cognitive changes can be totally normal, so there is no need to panic if you occasionally forget your sunglasses or the name of your son’s former teacher. But there is a clear difference between age-related cognitive changes and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 7 million people in America have dementia, and it’s expected that &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/united-states-dementia-cases-estimated-double-2060" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="number will double" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f4f9ce4b017c8f3fac047" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nyulangone.org/news/united-states-dementia-cases-estimated-double-2060" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;number will double&lt;/a&gt; by 2060. Experts say cognitive impairment becomes something more severe at a certain point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The magic line that transitions someone from mild cognitive impairment to dementia is when one of their cognitive impairments is impairing function. For me, that’s one of the key parts of defining when someone has transitioned to dementia,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/stephanie-nothelle/2705234" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Stephanie Nothelle" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f4f9ce4b017c8f3fac047" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/stephanie-nothelle/2705234" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Stephanie Nothelle&lt;/a&gt;, a geriatrician and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could mean no longer being able to use a car, getting lost while driving a familiar route or not being able to do one’s taxes after decades of doing them, she said. If cognitive changes make it tough to get through a normal day, that’s a red flag, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/dementia" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Dementia" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f4f9ce4b017c8f3fac047" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/dementia" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt; is an umbrella term that describes multiple forms of cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia), vascular dementia and Parkinson’s, according to Nothelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact manifestations of the disease depend on the actual diagnosis. And while cognitive impairment is a common thread, there are also some physical symptoms that tend to be associated with dementia. Here’s what they are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Trouble Walking And Balancing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I find that a lot of the more physical manifestations happen later in the course of dementia,” Nothelle said. But there is a physical issue that occurs earlier on and gets worse throughout the course of the disease, she said, and that’s “someone’s ability to walk and maintain balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ability to maintain your balance and walk smoothly, actually, it requires a lot of brain power because you have to process a lot of different inputs,” Nothelle noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to process sensations from your feet, you have to process what your eye is seeing in the environment around you and more. “You have to quickly react to these things, and so it’s a very cognitive task to be able to walk,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of all of this, trouble walking, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/importance-of-balance-health-falls_l_69149febe4b0c2898bed35f8" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="trouble balancing" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f4f9ce4b017c8f3fac047" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="69149febe4b0c2898bed35f8" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;trouble balancing&lt;/a&gt; and falling frequently is a sign of dementia. (But note that these issues aren’t only a sign of the disease; they can be due to arthritis or even clumsiness.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Posture Changes And Feet Shuffling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-most-common form of dementia is Lewy body dementia, said &lt;a href="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/jori-fleisher-md-msce-faan" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jori Fleisher" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f4f9ce4b017c8f3fac047" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/jori-fleisher-md-msce-faan" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Jori Fleisher&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush University in Chicago. This describes a few types of dementia, including Parkinson’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this manifestation, you may notice posture changes, feet shuffling or that someone is walking slower than they used to, Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s easy to chalk these issues up to getting older, not paying attention or arthritis, “if we’re seeing a pattern of that, we want to pay attention to it,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Changes In Your Sense Of Taste And Smell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A change in your sense of taste or smell can be attributed to many issues, such as a COVID-19 infection or a history of sinus problems, but outside of known factors, unexplained changes in these senses can also be related to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes the person doesn’t notice it themselves, but their loved one is going, ‘Hey, something on the stove and was burning and you didn’t smell that,’” Fleisher explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a symptom that should push someone to see a doctor. While it may not be a sign of all forms of dementia, it is associated with Lewy body dementia, according to Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Problems Swallowing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with dementia may also experience trouble swallowing food and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People will be eating or drinking, and things will have a tendency to accidentally ‘go down the wrong pipe,’ so to say,” said Nothelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the food actually does go down the wrong pipe, she said. “If you have food or fluid that goes down your windpipe into your lungs, that’s not supposed to be there,” Nothelle noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saliva helps us swallow food and drinks, and “our mouths are full of bacteria,” she said. While some of the bacteria is good, some of it is not-so-good (hence cavities and gum disease) and if that bad bacteria ends up in your lungs with your food, it can set you up for infection, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We call that aspiration pneumonia, and that’s why pneumonia is relatively common in the later part of dementia,” Nothelle explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Things such as swallowing trouble, balance problems and more can all be ways that dementia shows up physically.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Bladder Control Issues &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Incontinence, unfortunately, can be a symptom of dementia,” said Nothelle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of nerves are required for bladder control, “and those nerves degenerate as dementia progresses,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, folks may experience new constipation later in life, according to Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That can also be a sign of Parkinson’s and related conditions, and often precedes the other symptoms by years,” Fleisher noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Sleep Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Fleisher, sleep changes are also important to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person experiencing sleep changes may not notice, but if you live with someone and find they’re moving around a lot at night, punching, shouting or talking in their sleep, it’s important to let their health care team know, Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That may be something called REM behavior disorder, which often can come years before a person has Parkinson’s or Lewy body dementia,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An early diagnosis can be a powerful way to prepare for the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can certainly be hard to admit to any health problems or changes, especially when it comes to cognition — but it’s important to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are living in a time of innovation when it comes to dementia treatments, said Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s lots of different research going on right now to try to find treatments and pharmaceutical options for people,” Nothelle added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors can check biomarkers in blood or spinal fluid to determine what kind of dementia someone has and make treatment decisions based on that, Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what, it’s best to start treatments or interventions early on in the course of the disease, both Nothelle and Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatments aren’t a cure, but can help with disease management. More, an early diagnosis can also help families (and individuals) best prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finding out early on can be really helpful for a lot of different reasons, including planning and just having a say in your future,” said Nothelle. If you find out early, you often can still make some decisions, whether that’s your care, where you’ll live or financial choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all makes it important to pay attention to any signs of dementia (either in yourself or a loved one) and reach out to a doctor if you notice concerning changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As scary as we know that this is, a diagnosis and knowledge and early detection is power,” said Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you have any of the symptoms above or not, there are things you can do to reduce your dementia risk or slow down disease prevention. These include all of the things that go into a healthy lifestyle, both experts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To lower your chance of dementia, it’s helpful to follow a nutritious diet (Fleisher recommends the &lt;a href="https://www.rush.edu/news/mind-diet-ranked-no-1-brain-health" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="MIND diet" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f4f9ce4b017c8f3fac047" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.rush.edu/news/mind-diet-ranked-no-1-brain-health" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;), exercise, socialize with loved ones and manage chronic conditions like diabetes, high and sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts predict that 42% of Americans over 55 will &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="develop dementia" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f4f9ce4b017c8f3fac047" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;develop dementia&lt;/a&gt; in their lifetime, but there are things you can do to prepare for the disease if you get a diagnosis and things you can do to help lower your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPdVRFTTBkSWVqeFlKOHFBYmNSR2Zab2pvUWRaakpMR2t6MkJiOVk0ekJoRmViYXNhZUp4dUxCcGVLeXQ4d0pjVGtzTGZCckdCRlNWRGZYUTUzc29PLU9CUVgzbm9wLVFtWnRIWnY2V2pfNFhTc2xQN2tuYXo5U2lfTnVoZ0NnQ0I3bE53RFU5MHjSAZYBQVVfeXFMTXJ5YXMydE1iWmVIdmFLUVhOZXpFUXhmdk90N3ItUkc1TkcwUWs4MjdBNU81clowcXo0MDNVZkx4bllUb3JxZms2Y1lDdmZyMTZqN0otbERZX0g0c2hYektXZzJIM0pzMDB5OVZVZzA1NFhSeHp4a2JWNzNfcFFjSjRhZFN2RmI3S2RaTEp3MVhtQXppZzZB</guid></item><item><title>与大麻有关的呕吐综合征在美国呈上升趋势- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/vomiting-syndrome-linked-to-cannabis-is-on-the-rise-in-the-us</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A rare vomiting condition associated with chronic cannabis use is becoming more common at emergency departments in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition, called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_hyperemesis_syndrome"&gt;cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (CHS), is marked by severe and cyclical bouts of uncontrollable nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first case in the US was only &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/SGA.0000000000000730"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2009, and until recently, CHS did not even have a national diagnostic code, making it a challenge to track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-more-youth-are-landing-in-the-er-with-vomiting-from-cannabis-use-258375"&gt;Visits to the emergency room&lt;/a&gt; are one of the only ways to identify who is affected and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2016 and 2022, researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago found that CHS visits to emergency departments rose from roughly 4 visits per 100,000 people visiting the emergency department to 22 visits per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cannabis-use-is-linked-to-epigenetic-changes-scientists-discovered"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: Cannabis Use Is Linked to Epigenetic Changes, Scientists Discovered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings suggest CHS is still rare, it's a trend to keep an eye on, especially when there is a way to stop the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because someone uses cannabis or does so frequently does not mean they are doomed to develop CHS. No one knows why CHS affects a small proportion of cannabis users, but it is associated with frequent use, especially among those of younger ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The syndrome &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21665-cannabis-hyperemesis-syndrome"&gt;typically develops&lt;/a&gt; gradually over the first few years after initial use, with morning nausea or tummy pain, and can last for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more severe stage arrives later, when, for a day or two after cannabis use, patients are beset by overwhelming and recurrent vomiting and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, a hot bath or shower can sometimes relieve &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549915/"&gt;these horrible symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, albeit temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halting the use of cannabis can resolve the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="184238" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="184238" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; from 2020 to 2021, public health scientists James Swartz and Dana Franceschini found that CHS prevalence in US emergency departments increased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research analyzed roughly 806 million ER visits nationwide across the total period (2016-2022), and it is only the third national study to investigate CHS trends in US emergency departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospital visits for CHS were commonly made by people aged around 30, with slightly more female than male cases. The condition was most prominent in the West and Northeast compared with the South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not that increase is due to more people using cannabis frequently or due to improved awareness is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184250" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184250" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/m_zoi251225f3_1763396743.82921-642x308.png" alt="Vomiting Condition " class="size-medium wp-image-184250" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/m_zoi251225f3_1763396743.82921-642x308.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/m_zoi251225f3_1763396743.82921-768x368.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/m_zoi251225f3_1763396743.82921-600x287.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/m_zoi251225f3_1763396743.82921.png 810w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184250" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Conditional probability of CHS among visits with cannabis-related diagnoses, 2016 to 2022.

In certain published case studies, it's taken up to 17 hospital admissions to receive a diagnosis. Some patients are even accused of exaggerating their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone presents to the hospital with symptoms of CHS, they must be diagnosed through exclusion, after ruling out all other possible explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition has often been misdiagnosed as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14894-cyclic-vomiting-syndrome"&gt;cyclical vomiting syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which is treated differently. Cannabis use is key to whittling down the diagnosis, and yet that is a question some physicians don't think to ask, or some patients are unwilling to share answers to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The absence of a clear rise in CHS prior to 2020, despite expanding cannabis legalization and increasingly available high-potency products, presents a paradox," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.45310"&gt;admit&lt;/a&gt; Swartz and Franceschini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One possibility is underdiagnosis or misclassification before the syndrome gained broader clinical recognition.

&lt;p&gt;For more than a hundred years, &lt;strong&gt;toilet paper&lt;/strong&gt; has remained a fixture of modern hygiene—a default solution so widespread it’s rarely questioned. But that dominance is starting to crack, and the challenge isn’t coming from a Silicon Valley disruptor or climate legislation. It’s coming from a device that’s been standard in Japanese homes for decades: the &lt;strong&gt;Washlet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Created by Japanese plumbing leader &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toto.com/en/washlet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TOTO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the Washlet is a &lt;strong&gt;smart toilet seat&lt;/strong&gt; that cleans with water, dries with air, and often features heated seating, motion sensors, and self-cleaning nozzles. Its expanding global presence marks a broader shift in how people think about comfort, hygiene, and sustainability in the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once perceived as a cultural oddity outside Asia, the Washlet has crossed a significant threshold. More than &lt;strong&gt;60 million units&lt;/strong&gt; have been sold worldwide as of 2022. In Japan, over &lt;strong&gt;80% of homes&lt;/strong&gt; already use the technology. In North America and Europe, adoption is accelerating, driven by pandemic-induced shortages and renewed scrutiny of paper-based habits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Mounting Case Against Toilet Paper&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toilet paper consumption is quietly staggering. Each American uses around &lt;strong&gt;140 rolls annually&lt;/strong&gt;, a level of use that leads to the felling of about &lt;strong&gt;15 million trees&lt;/strong&gt; and nearly &lt;strong&gt;473 billion gallons of water&lt;/strong&gt;, based on data from the Natural Resources Defense Council.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By comparison, a Washlet cleaning cycle uses roughly &lt;strong&gt;500 milliliters of water&lt;/strong&gt;—a tiny fraction of the resources required for even a single roll of paper. The devices are also designed to be energy-efficient, incorporating &lt;strong&gt;on-demand water heating&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;standby power-saving features&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/toto-the-washlet-electronic-bidet-toilet-1200x727.jpg" alt="Toto, The Washlet Electronic Bidet Toilet" class="wp-image-93047"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;By 2022, over 60 million units had been sold. Today, with focus on wellness, TOTO continues to develop advanced new technologies for WASHLET. Credit: TOTO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A 2021 study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590088921000329" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Cleaner Production&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; concluded that switching to a bidet can reduce the &lt;strong&gt;carbon footprint of bathroom hygiene by up to 75%&lt;/strong&gt; over time. That’s a dramatic improvement for a device that uses water instead of virgin pulp and doesn’t require harsh chemicals or plastic packaging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interest surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when &lt;strong&gt;toilet paper shortages&lt;/strong&gt; exposed the fragility of traditional supply chains. Search traffic for &lt;em&gt;“bidet toilet seat”&lt;/em&gt; hit record highs, and many of those who made the switch never went back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Hospital Tool to Household Staple&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TOTO launched the first Washlet in &lt;strong&gt;1980&lt;/strong&gt;, building on earlier concepts used in Japanese hospitals and elder-care facilities during the 1960s. Early American “wash-air seats” were bulky, expensive, and prone to &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/nasa-jet-flies-without-leaving-runway/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="90418" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;temperature regulation failures&lt;/a&gt;. But TOTO’s engineers redesigned the system from the ground up—introducing the &lt;strong&gt;Washlet G&lt;/strong&gt; after extensive ergonomic and usability testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The product was later recognized in Japan as a &lt;strong&gt;Mechanical Engineering Heritage&lt;/strong&gt; milestone. Today, advanced models offer a wide array of features designed to enhance hygiene, comfort, and sustainability:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjustable warm water spray&lt;/strong&gt; for front and rear cleansing&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-cleaning nozzles&lt;/strong&gt; that rinse before and after each use&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air dryers&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;deodorizers&lt;/strong&gt; built into the seat&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heated seats&lt;/strong&gt; with energy-saving sleep modes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touchless operation&lt;/strong&gt; with motion sensors or remote controls&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick-detach designs&lt;/strong&gt; for easier cleaning and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The brand’s official website describes the Washlet as &lt;em&gt;“life-changing technology,”&lt;/em&gt; combining hygiene, design, and wellness. It’s marketed less as a luxury and more as an upgrade to one’s daily health routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washlets now appear in &lt;strong&gt;hotels, airports, offices, and residential bathrooms&lt;/strong&gt; across Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Europe. Leading retailers including &lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Home Depot&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Best Buy&lt;/strong&gt; now offer Washlets and similar seats for home installation—most without requiring a plumber.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Changing Culture Around Cleanliness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Western markets, resistance to bidets has typically been cultural. Many consumers simply weren’t familiar with the concept, or dismissed it as too foreign. But that resistance is eroding—thanks in part to social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Influencers and sustainability advocates on platforms like &lt;strong&gt;TikTok&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;YouTube&lt;/strong&gt; have reframed bidets as practical, eco-conscious choices rather than exotic novelties. Younger consumers in particular are more receptive to products that align with &lt;strong&gt;green values&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;minimalism&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;technological convenience&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ease of installation helps. Most Washlets fit onto standard toilets and require only a nearby power outlet. Cost barriers are also shrinking, with entry-level models priced below $300 and offering basic bidet functionality with self-cleaning nozzles and adjustable pressure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public restrooms are starting to reflect this change. Facilities in airports across &lt;strong&gt;Germany&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dubai&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;South Korea&lt;/strong&gt; now feature integrated bidet systems, citing both user comfort and sanitation as motivating factors.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Genetics is rarely as straightforward as a single gene driving a lone health outcome. But a new study has uncovered what could be a rare exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes to just one gene, called &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt;, have now been tied to psychiatric symptoms, including early-onset  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="184036" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our current findings indicate that &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt; is the first known gene that, on its own, can cause a mental illness," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/veraenderungen-eines-gens-koennen-psychische-erkrankungen-verursachen-2025-11-14"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; co-lead author Johannes Lemke, a geneticist from Leipzig University in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-acne-medication-linked-with-30-lower-schizophrenia-risk"&gt;Common Acne Medication Linked With 30% Lower Schizophrenia Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health disorders, like major  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="184036" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; or schizophrenia, are generally &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2018.09.002"&gt;thought&lt;/a&gt; to be influenced by hundreds or even thousands of interacting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/several-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-root-cause-study-shows"&gt;genetic variants&lt;/a&gt;. But perhaps that assumption isn't always true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2174/011570159X327712241023084944"&gt;strong evidence&lt;/a&gt; has found that changes to the &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A &lt;/em&gt;gene are associated with early-onset &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-seeds-of-schizophrenia-may-be-planted-in-the-earliest-moments-of-life"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; in childhood or early adolescence, sooner than the disorder typically presents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a registry of the world's largest cohort of &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt; patients, the researchers led an international investigation into the effects of mutations in &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 121 individuals with likely disease-causing variants in the &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt; gene, the team found that 25 had a diagnosed mental disorder, including mood, anxiety, psychotic, personality, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-long-term-impacts-of-eating-disorders-are-far-more-serious-than-you-might-realize"&gt;eating disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All but two of these individuals carried the "null" variant of &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt;, suggesting it was non-functional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184399" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184399" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DNA-under-magnifying-glass-colorful-642x361.jpg" alt="DNA Sanger Sequencing and a Magnifying Glass Showing the DNA Helix" class="size-medium wp-image-184399" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DNA-under-magnifying-glass-colorful-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DNA-under-magnifying-glass-colorful-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DNA-under-magnifying-glass-colorful-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DNA-under-magnifying-glass-colorful.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184399" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Among 121 individuals with likely disease-causing variants in the &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt; gene, 25 had a diagnosed mental disorder. (ktsimage/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were able to show that certain variants of this gene are associated not only with schizophrenia but also with other mental illnesses," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/veraenderungen-eines-gens-koennen-psychische-erkrankungen-verursachen-2025-11-14"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lemke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is striking is that, in the context of a &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt; alteration, these disorders already appear in childhood or adolescence – in contrast to the more typical manifestation in adulthood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, while &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK385627/"&gt;genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt; gene are typically associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/genes-linked-to-epilepsy-revealed-in-study-of-over-50000-people"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt; or intellectual disability, some of these participants showed only psychiatric symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt; change can drive isolated mental health disorders early in life without other neurodevelopmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Genetic testing should be considered in the diagnostic work-up of affected individuals to improve diagnosis and potentially offer personalized treatment," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03279-4"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt; encodes part of a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor"&gt;glutamate receptor&lt;/a&gt; in the brain, which are involved in excitatory brain activity. Dysfunction of these receptors is closely associated with epilepsy and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four individuals in the current study had been treated in the past with L-serine, an amino acid that activates these glutamate receptors to help &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13311-021-01173-9"&gt;reduce seizures&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, all four participants experienced positive improvements to their mental health disorder after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One individual stopped experiencing hallucinations. Another showed improvements in their behavioral disorder. The remaining two showed remission from paranoid symptoms and a reduction in seizure frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small sample size limits the study, but it suggests that not all &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/couples-are-more-likely-to-share-psychiatric-disorders-but-why"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; arise from numerous interacting genetic variants. Instead, some conditions could be precisely treated based on their genetic differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How exactly the &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt; gene may drive these disorders is another matter that needs further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03279-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

According &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-06-2024-nearly-1.8-billion-adults-at-risk-of-disease-from-not-doing-enough-physical-activity" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;to the World Health Organization (WHO&lt;/a&gt;), this reflects a worrying global trend where nearly 1.8 billion adults are at risk of disease because they don't do enough physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We all know that physical activity is good for our health but many of us are not active enough," says Amanda Daley, professor of behavioural medicine at Loughborough University in the UK. "There are lots of reasons, with the most common one being not having enough time. The micro exercise [or VILPA] approach to physical activity only requires a few minutes of people's time, a few times a day over a week, making it very easy, accessible and inexpensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;What VILPA shows is that simply tweaking your day so that you run for the bus, power walk around the house when doing errands, or carry out the housework or gardening with a bit more energy can make a significant difference when it comes to improving your health. These are all everyday examples of VILPA, as is playing high-energy games with your children and pets. "We have different opportunities to engage in moderate to vigorous activity and it doesn't necessarily have to be through [formal] exercise or specialised gym equipment," says Ahmadi. "If you're going for a walk, mixing in brief bursts of fast-paced walking can be an easy way to accrue VILPA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-bc40c3a0-0 kXcvpr"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 jJmNMc"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty images Everyday activities such as playing with your children or pets can boost fitness (Credit: Getty images)" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Everyday activities such as playing with your children or pets can boost fitness (Credit: Getty images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-13050-x" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Surveys show&lt;/a&gt; that people respond positively to the idea, as it highlights the benefits of activities which they may not previously have considered to be health-boosting.

Chan School of Public Health were once full of postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and interns. Young scientists here worked on some of the most cutting-edge computational biology research in the world, driving new discoveries and the creation of widely used big data tools, including one the National Cancer Institute named among the most important advances of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, the offices are rows of empty computer pods. Monitor brackets at each station hang in the air as bare as bleached corals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disaster that struck Quackenbush and his lab began earlier this year, when the Trump administration began rapidly slashing funds that fueled research programs all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;His is one of hundreds of labs that have been struggling to stay afloat since. Universities, facing the threat of even more deep cuts to National Institutes of Health funding in the near future, laid off support staff, reduced hiring, and recruited fewer graduate students and fellows. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, Quackenbush’s lab has been at the forefront of human genetics research and bioinformatics. The computational tools developed by the lab help scientists understand how genes are controlled and how things go awry in diseases from cancer to autism, and make it possible for scientists to model cell biology and genetics at a deeper, more complex level. That’s why many of the “most influential labs in the world” tend to collaborate with Quackenbush, said Kenneth Ramos, a cancer researcher at Texas A&amp;amp;M Health. As of this year, Quackenbush’s work has a staggering 100,000 citations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“John has been one of the most impactful bioinformaticians working in the genomic space in the last 25 years,” Ramos said. “He made a lot of resources he developed publicly available. He is bright, curious, and digs deep into scientific questions. And he is kind, the most collegial person you can imagine.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Quackenbush anticipated trouble, to an extent. When Donald Trump won the presidential election in 2024, Quackenbush decided to stop hiring new trainees. “I read the Project 2025 stuff. I knew biomedical research was in the crosshairs,” he said in an interview with STAT. If something happened to scientific funding, he wanted to make sure he could stretch whatever dollars he had for as long as possible. “I held back, trying to be cautious, not knowing what would happen,” he said. “And the money is now basically gone.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A major loss came in April, when Quackenbush, like many other scientists over the past year, learned that a research program he depended on was gone. He had submitted a renewal application for a grant to study sex and gender differences in medicine, but communication freezes and other disruptions delayed the review date. Then, on April 4, the review date for the grant vanished, and a program officer told Quackenbush that the program had been terminated because it “no longer aligned with administration priorities,” &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/nih-terminates-ongoing-grants-for-lgbtq-research/"&gt;a phrase&lt;/a&gt; that was quickly becoming familiar to scientists working on similar research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then the National Cancer Institute (NCI) ended its Outstanding Investigator Award program, a critical source of funding for Quackenbush that covered some of his salary. The program provided seven years of funding and was meant to minimize paperwork and incentivize the best researchers to pursue high-risk, high-reward science, both things that NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya has said are priorities for him. While those with ongoing awards will still continue to receive funds, Quackenbush’s reached the end of its seven years in 2025. He had expected to renew the grant, he said, based on the renewal application’s review scores, until the program ended. Then, the administration denied a no cost extension, which would have allowed him to spend down remaining dollars in the grant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That was devastating. And then, I was on a plane over Lake Michigan and all the mass terminations for Harvard grants came through,” Quackenbush said. “It was the same thing. I had this visceral feeling of fear and anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the loss of so much research funding, not hiring is no longer a choice, but a necessity. As students graduate and postdocs leave for other jobs, Quackenbush doesn’t have the dollars to bring on replacements. The research program he has spent decades building at Harvard, that has proven useful to countless other scientists, is in danger of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most scientists familiar with Quackenbush’s work know him as a methodologist, a computational tool builder. Over the last two decades, his lab created a suite of applications called the “Network Zoo,” machine learning tools focused around understanding gene regulatory networks, the web of molecular interactions and systems that control how cells use their genes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To explain, Quackenbush points out that every cell in a human body has the same genome. The thing that separates a neuron from a liver cell are the different arrays of genes that are silenced or active in one versus the other. “But that is what is different, not why they are different,” Quackenbush said. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Quackenbush became interested not just in which genes are active or silenced in cells, but in these complex networks consisting of 1,600 transcription factors, proteins that regulate the over 20,000 genes in the genome. “These transcription factors work alone and together to orchestrate when and how strongly genes turn off and on, activating not just one gene or another, but collections of genes that work together to carry out unique processes,” he said. “It’s a many to many problem. So you have this complex network that potentially has hundreds of thousands of connections.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modeling and studying these networks can help scientists build a deeper understanding of human biology and potential disease causes and therapeutics. But the only way to model such a network is through computational tools like the ones that Quackenbush and his lab build, said Ramos at Texas A&amp;amp;M. Each application in the Network Zoo is named after a different animal, like PANDA or EGRET, and can help scientists explore different aspects of gene regulatory networks. One recent application, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/cbiit/news-events/news/2024/machine-learning-approach-helps-interpret-genome-wide-dynamics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PHOENIX&lt;/a&gt;, helps scientists better understand how gene networks change over time and is the first such network model that can scale to all estimated 20,000 genes in the human genome, and was noted by the NCI as a key advance in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quackenbush doesn’t see himself primarily as a tool builder, though. To him, the applications are a means to an end, a way to satisfy scientific and biological questions that fascinate him and his colleagues. What truly excites him is being able to use the tools to do science. For instance, he and one of his current postdocs, Tara Eicher, wanted to study how certain genes implicated in glioblastoma, an aggressive type of brain cancer, are related to one another and whether they might help explain certain differences in outcomes between men and women. “Tara grabbed onto this idea and developed a method she calls BLOBFISH, which is the ugliest or cutest looking fish in our animal name paradigm,” Quackenbush said. “It’s a creative way to take networks and find how genes are connected within them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eicher and Quackenbush are now starting to use that method to study glioblastoma, and employing BLOBFISH to study genes related to autism as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All the Network Zoo tools are open source and freely available for scientists to use, and they’re also relatively easy to use, Ramos said. “What [Quackenbush] did was make bioinformatics accessible,” he said. “He’s written them in code that somebody with reasonable bioinformatics expertise can adopt pretty readily. He’s done that by design.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his own work, Ramos used a Network Zoo program called ALPACA to better understand how to overcome drug resistance in cancer. Other researchers, like Brigham and Women’s Hospital physician scientist Dawn DeMeo, have used the Network Zoo to make discoveries in other diseases. A key interest for DeMeo and her lab is sex differences in lung diseases like COPD, asthma, and lung cancer. Before she learned about the Network Zoo applications, DeMeo said it felt impossible to study some of the questions she works on now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As a clinician, I knew there were remarkable differences in lung disease between men and women. As someone doing research in genetics and genomics, I felt we didn’t have the tools yet to answer these questions,” DeMeo said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Collaborating with Quackenbush’s lab made it possible for DeMeo to start finding some of these differences. For one, while actual gene expression, or creation of proteins, is roughly the same in men and women, DeMeo and Quackenbush discovered large differences in how those same genes were regulated between sexes. “We were shocked to find that across many organ systems, we saw this same pattern,” she said. That meant gene regulatory networks might be a key avenue to understand why women respond better to chemotherapy, for example, or why asthma is more common in young boys before puberty but more common in women after puberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-shrinking-lab"&gt;The shrinking lab&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the grants that supported Quackenbush’s lab either cancelled or running out soon, the availability of these tools may become more limited. For one, without being able to hire graduate students and fellows, there just won’t be the people power to continue developing new tools to investigate new kinds of questions at the same rate. Quackenbush’s lab also has to maintain the tools, making sure that they remain up to date and compatible with the latest versions of programming languages like Python.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Over time, without lab members to keep this up, the Network Zoo will decay, and scientists like DeMeo and Ramos may not be able to continue using them. “Every time there’s a new release of R and Python, we have to go in and upgrade all the code. Otherwise it won’t run,” Quackenbush said. The lab also supports some of the cost of keeping these resources online. “Now, with more than 20 software tools in this repertoire, it takes a lot to maintain them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A year ago, nine postdocs and graduate students made up the Quackenbush lab. Now, he’s down to three. Where lab meetings used to fill up a large conference room, they now meet in a smaller office. As he watched the lab shrink over the year, he said one small mercy was that he hasn’t had to fire anyone. “All these people who worked with me have gone on to good positions,” he said. “Even one of the postdocs working with me now just interviewed for a job. People have gone on to great things, and I’m proud of them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the morale among the remaining researchers has fallen. A dark cloud began to hang over the departures. One postdoc told STAT the decision to leave the lab was accelerated by the federal funding cuts and instability in academic science this year. Eicher interviewed for an industry job this year, but withdrew her application. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, she’s worried about funding for her postdoc running out. Eicher has two young children, and her family needs both her and her husband’s income to support them. That also makes it more difficult to find jobs abroad, she said, even as leaving the U.S. to pursue science has become increasingly attractive since the start of the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of people talking about going to Europe, given the current climate,” Eicher said. “That’s not really an option for me. I don’t think moving my kids to another country is really feasible at this point. It’s a lot to consider.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Staying at Harvard feels like walking on thin ice, though. Harvard’s School of Public Health, which has relied heavily on grant funding, has steadily increased austerity measures, cutting costs wherever it could. In the department of biostatistics, there are only four new Ph.D. students, compared to the usual dozen or more. And there’s no more coffee provided, a longtime staple of the break room. “It does give a different feeling,” Eicher said, looking at the empty space where the coffee once sat. “It really illustrates that we don’t have money for any type of thing that we don’t absolutely need.” &lt;/p&gt;

He’s also looking for ways to spin out technology startups from his work. “It’s taught me that I am wired in a way that reflects stoic philosophy,” he said. “I look and say, ‘all right, is there something else I can do that will move things forward?’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Sophie Park for STAT&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-luckiest-person-in-the-world"&gt;‘Luckiest person in the world’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, Quackenbush still has a small amount of money from grants that continue to support his remaining lab members and cloud supercomputing costs, but it won’t last forever. He estimates the lab has had about $1.2 million lost or withheld this year, and possibly close to $10 million research dollars lost over multiple, future years. What remains is a small subcontract that expires in May, a grant from Amazon Web Services, and “a small amount of money from the NCI that fell in the gap between my grant programs being terminated and the mass terminations, and subsequent restoration, of funding at Harvard,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He’s been considering other positions as other institutions have tried to recruit him, including the University of Oxford. So far, though, he hasn’t made any decisions — adding that the financial package didn’t make moving the lab over to England feasible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quackenbush said he’s been managing the lab’s dwindling finances by looking for new opportunities, like finding ways to spin out technology startups from his work. “It’s taught me that I am wired in a way that reflects stoic philosophy,” he said. “I look and say, ‘all right, is there something else I can do that will move things forward?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even stoics can struggle, though. At an annual physical earlier this year, Quackenbush recalled checking through several mental health questions. “Are you depressed? Yes. Are you anxious? Yes. Hopeless? Yes. It’s just such a challenging time right now,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s been frustrating for him is the sense that many in the public and in the administration don’t understand what scientists like him are trying to do and who they are. “The perceptions are all over the place. We’re at Harvard. We’re the elites. In abstract, it’s easy to make scientists a political scapegoat. But if you talk to people and lay out what you do and ask, are you interested in people trying to cure cancer, the answer is yes,” Quackenbush said. “If you ask them about the things we do on a day-to-day basis, the answer is always yes, it’s important.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quackenbush grew up with a single parent in a small Pennsylvania town called Mountain Top. “Wilkes-Barre area, not really quite a town,” he said. “I was supposed to be nothing.” As a high school student, Quackenbush worked as a dishwasher in a restaurant. “One day, the police burst in and arrested our cook and hauled him out. Then my boss said, does anyone know how to cook? I said I can boil water, and he said, you’re promoted,” Quackenbush said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later, choosing between going to college and becoming the restaurant’s assistant manager was a big decision. “For me, this was far more than I thought I could achieve — an assistant manager in a restaurant,” he said. But he felt called to Caltech, and so became the first person in his family to graduate college. From there, Quackenbush earned a Ph.D. in physics and did research in theoretical and experimental physics before switching to genetics and starting his lab in computational biology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government and public investment into science supported that journey, something that Quackenbush said he’s grateful for every day. “As a scientist, I feel like I’m the luckiest person in the world. I’ve been able to do really interesting things, and I’ve been paid to do that by the American taxpayers,” he said. “Society has made this investment in me, and my responsibility is to provide a return on that investment.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s harder than ever now, with the lab a shadow of what it once was. Getting new large grants may not necessarily be a quick fix, as private foundation dollars are more in demand than ever, and public grant applications are an intensive and competitive process that may take a year or more. Much of the money he still has will run out in the spring, he said. “I have no idea what’s going to happen beyond that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, he said, the lab will continue working. “Every day we come in to fight through the current situation as much as possible. We want to continue research. We want to continue to make advances,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And they will, even if at a much slower pace, Quackenbush said, until they can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Scientists are examining how tattoos may affect the immune system and warn that what might seem a purely cosmetic procedure could influence the way the body fights disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study by the Institute for Research in Biomedicine at the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) in Switzerland investigated the toxicity of tattoo inks, focusing on the three most commonly used colours: black, red, and green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This work represents the most extensive study to date regarding the effect of tattoo ink on the immune response and raises serious health concerns associated with the tattooing practice,” researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in PNAS, found that tattoo ink not only remains in the skin but also travels through the body, accumulating in the immune system, where it can stay for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within these tissues, the ink triggers cell death, as macrophages — key immune cells — cannot digest the captured pigment, causing inflammation that may weaken the body’s defences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reaction appeared stronger in tattoos made with red and black ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tests with mice, scientists observed that pigments rapidly travelled to the animals’ lymph nodes, where they accumulated for two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following tattooing, the mice’s immune response to COVID-19 vaccines weakened, although the same inks appeared to enhance the response to a UV-inactivated flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Swiss researchers stated that these findings must be validated through human studies and across different vaccine types.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is also studying the potential long-term health effects of tattooing, particularly its links to immune response, lymphomas, and other cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the pigment particles are nanoparticle-sized and they can move beyond the dermis.Exposure to tattoo ink may be systemic rather than local, according to IARC’s research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tattoo prevalence is highest in Europe and the United States, reaching up to 40 per cent among adults under 40. “As this trend grows, the relevance of tattoo safety for public health is increasing proportionally,” the IARC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do tattoos alter theskin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tattooing involves injecting ink into the dermis — the deeper layer of skin — using needles that create tiny punctures. This process triggers an immune response, as the body recognises the ink particles as foreign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process induces localised inflammation as the immune system attempts to heal the skin injury caused by the needles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tattoo inks, composed of colour pigments diluted in a carrier liquid, may contain up to 100 chemicals. While black tattoos are typically done with carbon pigment, colored tattoos typically contain industrial organic pigments originally designed for plastics, varnishes, or paints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the ink has been regulated since 2022 by the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation, which intends to harmonise the legislation across member states. &lt;/p&gt;

When cognitive abilities start to fade even slightly, people naturally adjust their driving without always noticing why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Common factors that cause brain aging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12662389/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;on November 26, 2025, tracked nearly 300 older adults using GPS devices in their cars over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12662389/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Researchers from Washington University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;analyzed real-world driving patterns to see if they predicted mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an early stage of memory loss that often precedes dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study's start, drivers with normal cognition and those with subtle memory issues drove similarly. Over time, however, those who developed or already had MCI showed clear changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They drove fewer trips per month, avoided nighttime driving more often, stuck to shorter distances, repeated the same simple routes, explored fewer new places, and spent less time at higher speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes these shifts telling? Healthy older drivers often self-regulate wisely. They skip night drives or highways to feel safer. But the MCI group showed steeper, more consistent drops that went beyond caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an intriguing study, machine learning models that were exclusively trained on driving data, without the inclusion of memory assessments or brain imaging scans, were able to accurately identify drivers with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) with a remarkable precision of 80 to 87 percent. In certain instances, this innovative approach actually surpassed the effectiveness of traditional screening methodologies that rely solely on factors such as age or genetic predisposition. The lead researcher, Ganesh M. Babulal, observed that "Driving patterns serve as digital biomarkers that reflect brain health in our daily lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier research supports this. A 2022 Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience study found driving cessation predicts dementia risk up to six years ahead.

Plenty of sharp seniors avoid rush hour or bad weather for comfort. The difference lies in patterns over months or years. Sudden reliance on one short route, new anxiety about familiar roads, or family stepping in "just to be safe" warrant attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/125745789.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;amp;utm_medium=text&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cppst" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Gastroenterologist shares 4 signs of colon cancer in the 30s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have identified an intriguing overlap between the concepts of smart self-regulation and the phenomenon of unconscious compensation. For instance, an individual who is experiencing a decline in their planning skills might find themselves skipping errands without even realizing it. Early detection of such behaviors can pave the way for timely intervention and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red flags:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Family and friends often notice first.

They signal time for a doctor's visit and cognitive screening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A tool for early detection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research promises proactive screening.

No need for clinic visits until patterns flag risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/5298" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Academy of Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;highlighted this potential: "Driving data could transform how we catch cognitive decline early". For now, it reminds us driving reveals real-world brain performance better than paper tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Steps to protect brain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving changes are just one puzzle piece.

Tests like MoCA or driving simulations help clarify next steps. Early action beats crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your wheel time tells a story. Those routine choices might whisper about brain health long before words do.

Large cohort and meta‑analysis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12540132/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;link higher intake of red meat, organ meats, and seafood with higher uric acid and greater gout risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Top Dry Fruits to Lower Uric Acid Levels - A Healthy Snack Option&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, fructose, especially from sweetened beverages and desserts, has a unique ability to drive uric acid up by rapidly using ATP and increasing purine breakdown. Systematic &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7192665/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; show that higher fructose intake is consistently associated with hyperuricemia and gout in prospective cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why festivals are the “perfect storm”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Festive menus lean heavily on exactly the foods and drinks that push uric acid up: meat-heavy spreads, rich gravies, prawns or shellfish, sugary sweets, and free‑flowing alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224425003279" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; measuring purine content confirm that many meats, fish, and some shellfish easily cross the “high‑purine” threshold that’s considered risky for hyperuricemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, holidays usually mean bigger portions, late‑night eating, and less structured meals, so total purine and fructose load in a 24‑hour window can jump dramatically compared to usual routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even short periods of hypercaloric, high‑fat intake have been shown to raise serum uric acid, likely via changes in xanthine oxidase activity and reduced renal excretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol adds another layer. Ethanol metabolism burns through ATP and generates AMP, which then gets degraded into uric acid, so even “purine‑free” alcohol can raise serum uric acid quickly. Clinical and epidemiologic studies show alcohol intake roughly doubles the risk of hyperuricemia and gout compared with low or no intake, with stronger effects for beer and spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol also makes the kidneys less efficient at getting rid of uric acid, so you’re both making more and clearing less at the same time. When alcohol is combined with purine‑rich foods—the classic festival pattern—the hepatic and renal burden is even higher, which is why flares often show up the morning after a big celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sugar, snacks, and “holiday metabolism”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Festivals are a fructose festival, too: traditional sweets, packaged desserts, fruit juices, and soft drinks can deliver large, rapid hits of fructose. Experimental and mechanistic studies show that fructose acutely boosts purine synthesis and breakdown, driving uric acid up even in otherwise healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer on top the usual holiday pattern of less activity and more sitting, which promotes weight gain and insulin resistance, both of which are independently associated with higher serum uric acid. Adipose tissue itself can secrete more uric acid under obese and hypoxic conditions, further tightening the link between “holiday weight” and uric acid spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms of high uric acid level&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High uric acid doesn’t always show up with big, dramatic signs in the beginning, most people don’t even realise something’s wrong until the levels shoot up. But your body does drop small hints, and paying attention early can save you from a lot of pain later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most common symptoms is sudden, intense pain in the joints, especially the big toe. You might wake up in the middle of the night feeling like your toe is on fire or even too tender to touch. This is often called a gout attack, and it can last for days. Apart from the toe, uric acid pain can hit your ankles, knees, wrists or fingers too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another sign is swelling, stiffness, or redness around joints, making simple movements feel heavy and uncomfortable. Some people also experience a constant dull ache, like the joints are tired for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High uric acid can also show up as persistent fatigue, morning discomfort, or a feeling of heaviness in the body. If the kidneys are getting affected, you may notice lower back pain, or difficulty while urinating, sometimes even kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to enjoy festival without stressing about uric acid spike&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence is pretty clear: it’s the combination and concentration of triggers that matters most, not a single “bad” food. Helpful science‑backed tweaks include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting portions so meat and seafood are side players, not the main event, and emphasizing lower‑purine plant foods and dairy, which are associated with lower uric acid and gout risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swapping some sugary drinks and sweets for whole fruit, water, or unsweetened beverages to keep fructose load down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spacing alcohol, alternating with water, and keeping at least a few alcohol‑free days around the festival period to give the liver and kidneys a breather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You still get the joy and the food memories, but with far fewer post‑festival twinges from your joints and lab reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;This article is meant for general informational purposes only and should not be taken as professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart-healthy foods contain fiber, antioxidants, healthy fats, vitamins and minerals. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frozen foods retain their nutrients and offer an easy, nutritious option for your meals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make room in your freezer for berries, spinach, salmon and edamame.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You’re never too young to start focusing on heart health. This includes engaging in regular exercise, lowering your stress levels, getting plenty of quality sleep and eating a diet rich in heart-healthy nutrients—like omega-3s, fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you may naturally gravitate toward fresh produce and seafood, believing they’re nutritionally superior to their frozen counterparts, you may be surprised to learn that your freezer can be a true treasure trove when it comes to heart-healthy, nutritious foods. “Freezing preserves vitamins and minerals, and they’re incredibly convenient for busy days when fresh produce may not be available,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/krutika-nanavati/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Krutika Nanavati, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition researcher. “They also help reduce food waste and make it easier to maintain a consistent heart-healthy diet year-round.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By taking good care of your heart, you may lower your risk of heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure. “You’re also safeguarding your [other] organs, improving your energy levels, and reducing the risk of chronic conditions like diabetes and kidney disease,” says Nanavati.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We asked three nutrition and cardiovascular professionals to give us their top picks for heart-healthy frozen foods. While you clean out your freezer to make room for them, we’ll explain what makes them heart-healthy and give you a few delicious ideas for using them. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-berries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Berries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Raspberries, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-blueberries-11690014" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blueberries&lt;/a&gt;, strawberries, blackberries—choose your favorite and stock up. “Frozen berries are readily available, always in season, and they are packed with antioxidants that can reduce inflammation and lower your risk for heart disease,” says  &lt;a href="https://www.leonardpiankomd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Leonard Pianko, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a Florida-based cardiologist. “Berries retain their anthocyanins and phenolic compounds (antioxidants) when they are frozen, thereby reducing your risk for hypertension and atherosclerosis—aka hardening of the arteries.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Research suggests that berries contain several cardioprotective antioxidants, vitamins, and numerous phytochemicals, including the aforementioned phenolic compounds, which have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiplatelet properties—all important for maintaining healthy blood vessels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I love mixing [berries] into yogurt or oatmeal,” says Nanavati. “Very quickly, they soften and deliver an incredible burst of flavor that makes it very easy to get your nutrient-dense, heart-healthy boost first thing in the morning.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-spinach"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Spinach &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Popeye was onto something with his spinach. Spinach and other green leafy vegetables are high in nitrates, which have been shown to support heart health by reducing blood pressure, relaxing blood vessel walls and improving blood flow.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nanavati calls frozen spinach one of her kitchen lifesavers. On days when she’s short on either time or energy, she says it's helpful to have the greens already washed and chopped and ready to toss into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7899857/spinach-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, dals, soups and omelets. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-salmon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Salmon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frozen fatty fish, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8040993/is-salmon-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, is good for your heart because it is loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and low in saturated fat, says Pianko. “Fatty acids cannot be produced by your body, which is why it is essential to eat foods that are high in this nutrient,” says Pianko. “The proper freezing process locks in the nutrients, which can lower your triglycerides, reduce inflammation, improve your heart health, and can be as healthy as fresh fish.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Omega-3s&lt;/a&gt; are well-documented for heart-healthy benefits. For example, one systematic review and meta-analysis of 38 randomized controlled trials testing omega-3 fatty acids in nearly 150,000 participants found that these essential fats were associated with a lower risk of heart attack and other heart-related events, plus a reduced risk of dying from them.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-edamame"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Edamame &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Edamame are young soybeans that are picked before they’re fully ripened; they’re loaded with fiber, plant protein, potassium and antioxidants. “Frozen edamame is just so undervalued, and I always recommend them,” says Nanavati. “They're super rich in plant-based protein and fiber; both of these are very good for supporting healthy cholesterol levels. Sometimes I sprinkle a little salt or chili flakes on it, and other times I toss it into salads, grain bowls or stir-fries.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While research is mixed regarding its specific health benefits, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-high-protein-snack-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8786440" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;edamame’s heart-healthy benefits&lt;/a&gt; are partly attributed to its soluble fiber, known to help lower cholesterol, and potassium, which can help lower blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-easy-ways-to-add-frozen-foods-to-your-diet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Easy Ways to Add Frozen Foods to Your Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frozen foods are one of the fastest ways to add nutrition, reduce prep time and cut down on waste—if you use them strategically. Here are a few ideas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Add frozen vegetables directly to soups, stews, pastas or grain bowls for instant volume and nutrients without chopping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Toss frozen berries into smoothies or yogurt bowls, or use them in frozen desserts—like nice creams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use frozen fish for weeknight dinners. Frozen fish thaws quickly, cooks fast and offers a reliable source of lean protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swap in frozen edamame to boost the fiber, nutrients and protein in your meals, making them more filling and nutritious. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cardiologists and dietitians agree that your freezer is one of the easiest places to improve your heart health. Frozen produce, soy foods, whole grains and fatty fish all retain their nutrients, reduce food waste and make it simpler to build heart-healthy meals on busy days. Adding a few of these staples to your weekly routine may go a long way toward lowering LDL cholesterol, supporting healthy blood pressure and reducing inflammation. It’s a small shift that can add up to long-term cardiovascular benefits.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A shingles vaccination program that began in Wales in 2013 has led to two discoveries that give fresh hope to efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-dementia-pill-clears-first-major-safety-hurdle-trial-reports"&gt;treat dementia&lt;/a&gt;: The vaccine appears to reduce the risk of mild cognitive impairment, as well as slowing progression of dementia in those already diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shingles-vaccine-guards-against-dementia-study-reveals"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; on the discovery that the vaccine may help prevent dementia in April, after results were published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08800-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new follow-up study on the same data, this same vaccine has been linked to reduced cases of death by dementia in patients with an existing diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study, from an international team of scientists, adds to a growing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.3040"&gt;body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; that stopping  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="184143" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; that affect the nervous system – such as the varicella zoster  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="184143" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-shingles-myths-your-doctor-wants-you-to-stop-believing"&gt;causes shingles&lt;/a&gt; – could also protect against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/time-itself-could-be-a-crucial-element-in-preventing-dementia-study-finds"&gt;Time Itself Could Be a Crucial Element in Preventing Dementia, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because the vaccine is safe, affordable, and already widely available, this finding could have major implications for public health," &lt;a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/2985389-shingles-vaccine-may-help-prevent-and-slow-dementia,-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Haroon Ahmed, from Cardiff University in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More research is needed to test our work and understand more about the potential protective effect the vaccine offers against dementia, particularly how and why it works."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184146" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184146" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DementiaChart.jpg" alt="Vaccine dementia chart" class="wp-image-184146 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DementiaChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DementiaChart-600x601.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184146" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The vaccine protected against dementia and mild cognitive impairment. (Xie et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Welsh vaccination program rolled out more than a decade ago by the UK National Health Service gave researchers the opportunity to analyze a &lt;a href="https://www.mrcctu.ucl.ac.uk/patients-public/about-clinical-trials/what-is-a-randomised-clinical-trial/"&gt;randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, without actually running one: to ration vaccines, those aged 79 could get it, while those aged 80 couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That quirk meant that the effects of the vaccine could be studied in two very similar groups, with an age difference of just one year between them. It goes a long way to reducing the influence of other factors that play into dementia risk, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/learning-one-word-could-help-prevent-a-third-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;education level&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-health-in-middle-age-could-predict-your-later-dementia-risk"&gt;medical conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="docos-replyview-body docos-anchoredreplyview-body docos-replyview-body-emoji-reactable docos-replyview-body-emoji-reactable-background" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 14,350 people diagnosed &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-critical-thing-you-can-do-to-keep-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;with dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; prior to the start of the vaccine program, about half died of the condition within nine years. Being vaccinated against shingles made this nearly 30 percent less likely, according to the analysis, suggesting a significant level of protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the vaccinated participants were less likely or slower to develop mild cognitive impairment, a common precursor to dementia. Combined with the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shingles-vaccine-guards-against-dementia-study-reveals"&gt;earlier findings&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine reduced the risk of dementia starting at all, these are encouraging signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most exciting part is that this really suggests the shingles vaccine doesn't have only preventive, delaying benefits for dementia, but also therapeutic potential for those who already have dementia," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/shingles-vaccination-dementia.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Pascal Geldsetzer from Stanford University in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the serendipitous design of the Welsh vaccination program, the data isn't robust enough to show direct cause and effect – but it does show a significant connection that's worth investigating further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the next challenges is going to be figuring out why the shingles vaccine might be having this impact on dementia development and diagnosis. There might be nervous system or immune system mechanisms at play – viruses affecting the nervous system &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.06.030"&gt;have been linked&lt;/a&gt; in animal models to the toxic protein build-up seen with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="184143" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies could potentially look at larger groups of people across a wider range of ages, as well as investigating the latest shingles vaccine: the vaccine used in Wales in 2013 has since been retired for a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shingrix-vaccine-for-people-with-weakened-immune-systems/shingrix-vaccine-for-people-with-weakened-immune-systems"&gt;new and improved version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At least investing a subset of our resources into investigating these pathways could lead to breakthroughs in terms of treatment and prevention," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/shingles-vaccination-dementia.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Geldsetzer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.11.007"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While some people assume that shifting their bedtime on weekends or staying up late occasionally has little impact, the expert said the body responds almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Regular sleep times help maintain the body’s natural blood-pressure rhythm, which can be disrupted when bedtimes shift.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people trying to build a more consistent sleep routine, Lu recommends starting with the morning wake-up time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Start with a fixed wake time every day, including weekends, and anchor the schedule with morning light exposure — then set a consistent bedtime that gives you enough sleep before that wake time," he advised.

                &lt;p&gt;The same vaccine that keeps you safe from shingles could also do wonders for your brain, research out this week suggests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Stanford University and others examined what happened after shingles vaccination was introduced to the country of Wales over a decade ago. They found evidence the shingles vaccine not only reduced people’s risk of developing dementia but also lowered their odds of dying from dementia if they did have it. Boosting your immunity to shingles might offer a broad protective effect against cognitive decline, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This study suggests that [shingles] vaccination slows or prevents disease progression across the entire disease course of dementia,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01256-5"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in Cell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A natural experiment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several studies in recent years have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shingles-shots-dont-just-prevent-pain-they-might-save-your-life-2000674980"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that shingles vaccination has benefits beyond preventing the painful viral illness. But the researchers say their approach has allowed them to look at a natural experiment that occurred in Wales in 2013. That fall, the vaccination program officially began in the country, with clear age restrictions. People born on or after September 2, 1933 (80 years and under) were eligible for at least one year for the shingles vaccine, whereas people born before then were not.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These cut-offs (and the UK’s robust record-keeping) meant the researchers could easily track dementia rates among similar groups of older people right before and after the vaccine became available, with the non-eligible group acting as a sort of control. In a study &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/unique-study-is-latest-to-show-shingles-vaccine-can-prevent-dementia-2000583567"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this April, the researchers found that vaccinated people were 20% less likely to be diagnosed with dementia over a seven-year period.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This time, however, they were interested in seeing whether the vaccine was linked to better outcomes across the different stages of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using the same method, they found that vaccinated people were less likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the earliest potential stage of dementia (though many with dementia will first experience MCI, not everyone with MCI will go on to have full-blown dementia). And among diagnosed dementia cases, people vaccinated against shingles were also less likely to ultimately die as a result of their condition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“That means that the vaccine doesn’t just have a preventive potential, but actually a therapeutic potential as a treatment, because we see some benefits already among those who have dementia,” senior study author Pascal Geldsetzer, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/health/shingles-vaccine-dementia-progression-study-wellness"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; CNN. “To me, this was really exciting to see and unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;An already worthwhile vaccine&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These findings still can’t definitively prove that the shingles vaccine can affect dementia outcomes. That said, the team’s unique method does get around many of the limitations of observational studies. And taken as a whole, the evidence is mounting that the shingles vaccine has more health benefits than we initially realized.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just this past October, for instance, a study &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shingles-shots-dont-just-prevent-pain-they-might-save-your-life-2000674980"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that people vaccinated for shingles are also less likely to develop heart disease and stroke; they were also less likely to die earlier compared to non-vaccinated individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Shingles is one of the most painful experiences a person can have. And the vaccine is universally recommended for every American starting at age 50. So there’s already plenty of incentive to get your shots (it’s a two-dose vaccine). Lowering your risk of brain and heart disease just seems to be a great bonus, too.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

However, a diagnostic test exists. which detects cancer before any symptoms emerge. The Galleri multi-cancer early detection test provides family cancer patients with a valuable screening method, to identify various cancer types simultaneously which leads to better treatment results, and longer survival rates. Dr. Vass, M.D. tells us why the Galleri multi-cancer test can literally save your life!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What is the Galleri test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Galleri blood &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c205g21n1zzo" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; identifies more than 50 cancer types, by detecting tumor DNA fragments which appear in blood as cell-free DNA. The test uses artificial intelligence to detect cancer-specific chemical methylation signatures, which enable precise cancer location identification at a rate of 92%. The test results in more focused and time-efficient diagnostic procedures for patients. The test functions as a supplementary tool to standard cancer screening methods including mammograms, pap smears and colonoscopies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why early detection matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment success rate for cancer patients improves when doctors detect the disease during its initial stages, because symptoms emerge only when cancer reaches an advanced stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Galleri test identifies cancer at its initial stage in more than half of all detected cases (clinical trials showed early-stage cancer detection rates exceeding 50%). The discovery of cancer at an early stage enables medical professionals to initiate treatment procedures which minimize patient death rates. The PATHFINDER 2 study demonstrated that Galleri screening, increased cancer detection by more than seven times when used with standard cancer tests which led to the identification of pancreatic, liver, ovarian, bladder and stomach cancers without screening recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How effective is the Galleri test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Galleri test demonstrates 99.6% specificity which results in a 0.4% false-positive rate, that minimizes the need for additional medical &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2022/1000/diagnostic-tests-galleri-test-cancer.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. The positive predictive value of the test reaches 61.6% which means that 61.6% of people testing positive, will receive a cancer diagnosis. The test revealed cancer indicators in 0.93% of participants during research while confirming cancer in 0.57% of cases. The test detects cancers that standard screening methods fail to identify, which makes it an essential tool for early cancer detection and ongoing monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Who should consider this test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have cancer in their family history, should make Galleri and other MCED tests their top priority. Traditional cancer screening methods only check for a limited number of cancer types, but many cancers develop because of inherited genetic factors. The test enables patients to screen for various cancer types at once, which helps identify cancers that standard screening methods cannot detect. The test provides excellent benefits to people aged 50 and above, and those with additional risk factors who want to monitor their health actively. Patients need to consult their healthcare provider before adding this test to their cancer prevention strategy. The Galleri test functions as an additional screening tool, but patients should follow established screening recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Limitations and future outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Galleri test represents a breakthrough in medical science, although users need to understand its restricted capabilities. The test has not received complete approval from all regulatory organisations, and it does not guarantee complete cancer detection for all types and stages. Patients who receive positive test results need to undergo additional diagnostic procedures, which might include imaging tests and tissue sample examinations. The test continues to show promise through ongoing research, which aims to enhance its precision and medical benefits. The accumulation of additional research data will lead to worldwide cancer screening transformations which will enable doctors to detect diseases at earlier stages for better treatment results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical advice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>随着医院被感染淹没，中国正在与恐怖病毒爆发作斗争--《镜报》</title><link>https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/chinese-hospitals-battling-against-virus-36354116</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-body" class="ArticleBody_article__AwrJE" data-testid="body"&gt;&lt;h1 class="HeadingOne_heading-one__mmNWJ  __className_b5b325" publication="mirror"&gt;China fighting horror virus outbreak as hospitals overwhelmed by infection&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="LeadText_lead-text__wd_PA __className_8efb9b" data-testid="leadtext" publication="mirror"&gt;Hospitals across China are overwhelmed with patients battling an airborne virus across 17 provinces - with children among the hardest hit and the capital Beijing going through a peak flu period&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="Byline_byline-container__K_Owl" data-testid="byline"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-content" class="Byline_byline-content-wrapper__Imque"&gt;&lt;div class="Byline_author-badge-date-wrapper__Q7jj1"&gt;&lt;p class="Byline_dates-container__Rqzf2"&gt;&lt;span class="" data-testid="byline-publishedDate"&gt;18:49, 04 Dec 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Byline_updated-date__8vEV8 Byline_updated-date-with-published__ApG_G" data-testid="byline-updatedDate"&gt;Updated 21:00, 04 Dec 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="LightboxBtn_lightbox-btn__eoxYS" aria-label="Open image viewer" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-controls="image-lightbox"&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX ImageEmbed_image-lead__Ti3qQ" data-testid="leadimage" data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="36354153"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ImageEmbed_fig-caption__qotOK"&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_camera-style__Qjeby"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;g clip-path="url(#clip0_209_94274)"&gt;&lt;path opacity="0.16" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M14 4H2V10.6667C2 11.403 2.59695 12 3.33333 12H12.6667C13.403 12 14 11.403 14 10.6667V4ZM8 10C9.10457 10 10 9.10457 10 8C10 6.89543 9.10457 6 8 6C6.89543 6 6 6.89543 6 8C6 9.10457 6.89543 10 8 10Z" fill="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M2 3.33331H14V11.3333C14 12.0697 13.403 12.6666 12.6667 12.6666H3.33333C2.59695 12.6666 2 12.0697 2 11.3333V3.33331Z" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;circle cx="8" cy="8" r="2" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;path d="M11.3332 1.33331L12.6665 1.33331" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;defs&gt;&lt;clippath id="clip0_209_94274"&gt;&lt;rect fill="white"&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;/clippath&gt;&lt;/defs&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_caption-title__FSINC"&gt;Hospitals across China have been hit with waves of patients battling fever and influenza prompting fears of a viral outbreak across the country.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruou8n000o3b790ts5em6v@published"&gt;Over the past year, the agency has lost a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/health/cdc-kennedy.html"&gt;third&lt;/a&gt; of its staff. During the government shutdown, the administration &lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; to fire hundreds more. Scroll around and you’ll find &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/savehealthresearch/p/DRvuJrLDiby/"&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt; of the notes employees have allegedly been leaving behind. Some simply present data supporting their work, like “1.4 million children are living with HIV.” In the women’s bathroom, though, the messages are reportedly more pointed. They include &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/inside-rfk-jr-cdc-anti-vaccine-guidelines-policy-cuts-director-fired.html"&gt;Post-its&lt;/a&gt; reminding workers that “It’s okay to not be okay.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruoubn000p3b79nrh9imxb@published"&gt;But despite all this, this agency is still going about its business. On Thursday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is set to issue recommendations about the kinds of immunizations infants get, for instance. And there’s nothing any of us can do to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. have been around forever, arguably since the first vaccine, usually shouting from the sidelines, but now they’re not shouting from the sidelines anymore, they’re making policy,” says Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruouhp000r3b79z12tlybp@published"&gt;Former CDC directors, like Rochelle Walensky and Tom Frieden, have said they don’t trust the agency anymore, he notes, “so you can’t look to them, other than with your heart in your throat waiting for the next dangerous, misguided thing they say.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruoupj000u3b79grtkcnvo@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Harris: I want to break down exactly what this panel’s going to be talking about. The first day of the meeting, they will talk about the hepatitis B vaccine, which is given at birth to babies. I wonder if you can lay out why this vaccine has been so important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruousj000v3b79o72gjfzl@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Offit: &lt;/strong&gt;If your mother has hepatitis B and you then go through a birth canal that is invariably bloody that contains hepatitis B, and you’re then infected by passing through that birth canal, you need to be vaccinated at birth. And the reason is that if you’re not, you have an 85 percent chance of getting hepatitis B, passing through a birth canal that has the virus in it. And if you get it, you have a 90 percent chance of going on to develop chronic liver disease, which is to say cirrhosis or liver cancer, and it shortens your life. And if you get hepatitis B in the first five years of life, you have a 25 percent chance of going on to develop cirrhosis or liver cancer, which will shorten your life.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruouv5000w3b79ra0kihxm@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people would say, “Well, then just test the mother. See if the mother has hepatitis B. If she does, then you vaccinate the baby.” What would you say to that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruouyh000x3b79ga84kccw@published"&gt;Great, but it makes a few assumptions. There’s about a 5 percent false-negative rate, meaning falsely reassuring. Two, it assumes that you haven’t been infected in your second and third trimester. Three, it also assumes that when the child is between 1 and 5 years of age and goes to a day care center, everybody that person comes in contact with at that day care center is not chronically infected.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruov2q000y3b79nt9jnffv@published"&gt;Most people who are chronically infected with hepatitis B in this country, and there are millions, don’t know they’re infected, and they are highly contagious—50 to 100 times more contagious than human immunodeficiency virus, the cause of AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="36" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruov5l000z3b79xwnea7fc@published"&gt;The vaccine is as safe and as effective at birth as it is at two months of age. So why take that risk? Why would you ever take that risk? Because it’s a risk without benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruov8e00103b793u0zkjad@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I noticed that in the past year or so, you’ve been making a point to meet with people you disagree with, people who are leaders in the Make America Healthy Again movement. I wonder what you’ve learned from those conversations. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovbk00113b795je584yz@published"&gt;Generally, they don’t trust public health officials. They think that there’s a big conspiracy to hide the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovhk00133b79xh7qzsc8@published"&gt;I don’t think it matters. The conversations were collegial, but at the end of it, they don’t trust me, or they don’t trust people in public health, because they think that we’re lying to them. I don’t know how you get over that hump. There’s not a deep state. There are not forces working against you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovkh00143b79wkfgs0py@published"&gt;The people who are in public health want desperately to get it right. Know that we don’t know everything, and we have to be open-minded as we learn new things. But vaccines don’t cause autism. That’s not a thing to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovnq00153b794l4mny0a@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve said that you think the only thing that will break through to everyday Americans who may be feeling very strongly about vaccines or may have misinformation about vaccines is for kids to get sick, and even to die. I hear you saying something like that, and as a patient and a person, I feel kind of abandoned. I just feel like, &lt;em&gt;Hold it. Families I know are going to have to pay this horrible price?&lt;/em&gt; How would you respond to someone like me? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovqu00163b79u8o5pt1w@published"&gt;This tears me apart. I think that everybody in public health who’s watching what’s going on is horrified by what’s happening. And we’re not the establishment anymore. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the establishment. Anti-vaccine activists are the establishment. They’re the ones that are making policy, and no one’s pushing back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovts00173b79hbk8g9ce@published"&gt;And so what can we do? Seventy-five Nobel Prize winners decried the appointment or confirmation of RFK Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services. Thousands of doctors have written this. All the professional medical and scientific societies have decried this and written letters about this and had thousands and tens of thousands of signatures. A lot of people go on national television to decry how awful this is. I just feel like we’re screaming into the void.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="28" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovwj00183b79x1xnn21a@published"&gt;And it is such a defeat to think that these children are dying unnecessarily. And so I understand you’re feeling abandoned. I do. I feel the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovz800193b79yvegt7pa@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guess I wonder, given our whole conversation and what we’ve said, whether broader action is needed and how you feel about that. How do we mobilize together to create some kind of attentional event, whether it is a strike of health care workers or something else, that would make clear to the country exactly what’s on the line in this moment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruow22001a3b79fk81vyrc@published"&gt;I think what would have the most impact is a parents’ march, where parents all get together—Republican, Democrat, independent—and say, “We are worried about what’s happening to our children. We are worried that vaccines are becoming more expensive, less available, more feared. We’re worried about the future.” This is a fragile market. I don’t think people quite realize how fragile the vaccine market is. It’s something you get once or a few times in your lifetime. It’s never going to compete with drugs you’re taking every day. This is a weak stepchild for these pharmaceutical companies. They can drop vaccines they have. They did. In many ways that is RFK Jr.’s goal. Parents need to stand up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruow8a001c3b799a5benlj@published"&gt;I think there are a lot of different places one can look to get good advice. There’s our Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia, but there are other excellent sources. The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy in Minnesota has excellent information about this upcoming hepatitis B vaccine story.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruowbv001d3b79tpnonf1z@published"&gt;There are a number of places where you can educate yourself. And I do think that it’s still somewhat of a democracy here in this country, and you still can pretty much say what you want, although people seem to be more scared these days. But there’s still a lot of good information out there.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruoweg001e3b79ok23vrst@published"&gt;And a lot of people&lt;em&gt; are&lt;/em&gt; standing up. You see academic and professional societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics coming up with their own recommendations based on their own expert advisory groups. Same thing for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Disease Society of America. You can look to those sites to find accurate evidence-based information. And states are standing up. There are coalitions being formed in the Northeast and Northwest about how to have your own expert advisers. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro is looking into creating a vaccine for children program that can provide vaccines to uninsured or underinsured children, because they don’t trust the CDC.&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Participants recalled learned word-image pairs more accurately when reminder cues were presented during or just before inhalation, while the brain’s actual reconstruction of the memory occurred during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brainwave recordings revealed that successful remembering involved reduced alpha and beta activity alongside the reactivation of original learning patterns. These findings suggest that breathing acts as a natural timing mechanism that coordinates perception and memory inside the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breath-Linked Recall:&lt;/strong&gt; Memory cues are most effective when presented during or just before inhalation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhalation Retrieval:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain reconstructs memories primarily during exhalation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Signatures:&lt;/strong&gt; Successful recall involves suppressed alpha and beta waves and memory reactivation patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;LMU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First and foremost, we breathe in order to absorb oxygen – but this vital rhythm could also have other functions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, a range of studies have shown that respiration influences neural processes, including the processing of stimuli and memory processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LMU researchers led by Dr. Thomas Schreiner, leader of an Emmy Noether junior research group at the Department of Psychology, in collaboration with colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin and the University of Oxford, have analyzed how respiration influences the retrieval of previously learned materials and recorded what happens in the brain during this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the experiment, 18 participants learned to associate 120 images with certain words. The participants were then asked to recall these associations, and then asked to recall them again after a two-hour afternoon nap. While this was happening, the researchers recorded their breathing as well as their brain activity via EEG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respiratory rhythm helps with multi-stage remembering process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, the study results show that the participants were better able to recall the words and the corresponding images when the reminder cues were presented during or just before inhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the EEG, it becomes apparent, however, that the actual memory retrieval tends to happen during subsequent exhalation,” reports Schreiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our data thus points to a sort of functional bifurcation: Inhalation is a favorable moment to receive the reminder cue, while exhalation is a favorable moment for the actual reconstruction of the memory in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shows that respiratory rhythm shapes the temporal interplay of perception and effective remembering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the EEG recordings, the researchers found two characteristic signatures of successful remembering, which offer insights into the underlying neural patterns: One was the weakening of certain brainwaves – more specifically, alpha and beta activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the brain might activate a memory and focus more strongly on retrieval. The second signature consisted of so-called memory reactivations. In successful remembering, the same neural patterns resurfaced here as were active during learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the experiment, the participants concentrated wholly on the memory task while maintaining their natural respiratory rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To find out whether useful everyday strategies can be derived from our findings, we would need studies with targeted respiratory manipulation,” says first author Esteban Bullón Tarrasó. He also notes the need for more research into older memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, the underlying mechanisms suggest that respiration also plays a role there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual variations can exist in the extent to which memory-relevant brain processes are synchronized with respiration. The researchers found differences in degree between the participants, from which they conclude that respiration is linked more efficiently to neural processes in some people than in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if brain and respiration interact better, then presumably remembering works better accordingly: “Respiration is a natural pacemaker for memory processes, highlighting how closely our bodies and brains interact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764878903509"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Does breathing affect how well we remember things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.

Specifically, we found that both key neural signatures of successful remembering were co-modulated during exhalation, with the strength of the interaction between respiration and reactivation processes being associated with memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest that respiration may act as a scaffold for episodic memory retrieval in humans by coordinating the neural conditions that support effective remembering.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 20:12:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE85c1AzVnNEQ19vVjllOU9sTzdzRjhNamd5S3FxY3YyNkZVOW1LblV3MnpUbG94Wjh5QUh4STFIZkpfd2VlSVJYV1luSm53SlU2QlBZQTJnVWxMakp2T2t0dEZJelRFX2x5ZV83cERSRGlxWlE</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心顾问推迟对婴儿乙型肝炎疫苗的计划投票：疫苗-健康新闻- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/04/nx-s1-5629199/cdc-acip-hepatitis-b-vaccine-meeting</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unexpectedly postponed controversial votes Thursday on changes to the current recommendation of universally immunizing newborns against hepatitis B. Confusion and disagreement over the language of the votes led the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, to push them to Friday.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee meeting was marked by unusual conflict and chaos.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is the third version of the questions that we have received in 72 hours, and we're trying to evaluate a moving target," said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a psychiatrist and voting member of the committee. "I protest the description that the ACIP members have been consulted in developing these questions."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The vote was intended to focus on ending a longstanding recommendation to vaccinate all healthy newborns against hepatitis B, regardless of whether the mother tests positive or negative for the virus. But the language of the vote was changed between the time it was posted Friday morning to the early afternoon and some members of the group wanted more time to consider it in writing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The current recommendation is intended to make sure no at-risk infant falls through the cracks, and to confer lifelong protection for all U.S. children against the hepatitis B virus, which can cause serious, potentially fatal health problems. It is the cornerstone of a decades-long strategy &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841644" target="_blank"&gt;to eliminate hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B, which is often spread through sexual contact and drug use, can be transmitted from mothers to infants during childbirth, and in infancy through contact with an infected person's body fluids, such as their blood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The virus attacks the liver and chronic infection can lead to liver cancer, cirrhosis and death. The risks of these outcomes are much higher for people who get infected as infants. There's no cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Thursday's discussion, there was a pronounced split between some of the attendees who spoke in favor of changing the recommendation and others who were against a change.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tracy Beth Høeg, a representative for the Food and Drug Administration, questioned the need for the current universal policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Babies who are born without high risk factors, without a mother who is antigen positive, without a family member who has hepatitis B – for these babies, the potential for benefit is so low," said Høeg, who was named as acting director for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research on Thursday. "Why are we stating that it is absolutely necessary to give this dose at birth, when high income nations throughout the world are not?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine, defended the current policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This disease has gone down in the United States, thanks to the effectiveness of our current immunization program," said Meissner, who is the only current member that has served on the committee in the past. When challenged by another adviser, Robert Malone, a vaccinologist and biochemist, to caveat this statement as his "opinion," he replied: "These are facts, Robert."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nonvoting liaisons from medical professional groups spoke out against the process, which deviates from how ACIP usually works.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As physicians, your ethical obligation is to 'first, do no harm' and you are failing in that by promoting this anti-vaccine agenda without the data and evidence necessary to make those informed decisions," said Dr. Jason Goldman, a liaison for the American College of Physicians. "Your job as a committee is to look at the totality of the risks and benefits, the harms, the equity, which you have not done."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The postponement leads to a packed agenda on Friday. In addition to the vote to change the hepatitis B policy, the committee is scheduled to discuss how the U.S. vaccine schedule compares to that of other countries, and the links between aluminum – an ingredient used in more than a dozen vaccines to make them more effective – and asthma.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Most medical professionals say there's no good evidence that aluminum adjuvants are unsafe and ample evidence that they pose no real concern.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many public health experts are concerned that this week's moves are part of a concerted effort to undermine vaccine access in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's advisory committee wields enormous power because its recommendations influence how doctors vaccinate patients and dictate whether insurance companies pay for shots.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the committee has lost the trust of most mainstream medical groups since Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5438482/cdc-vaccine-committee-acip-meeting-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;replaced its members in June&lt;/a&gt; with his own slate. The committee has also abandoned longstanding collaborations with medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and draws less on the experience of CDC experts.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935" target="_blank"&gt;fired in June&lt;/a&gt; and replaced with a group that has largely expressed skepticism of vaccines — once again delayed an expected &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-advisers-reverse-newborn-hepatitis-b-vaccine-recommendations-rcna246812" target="_blank"&gt;vote on hepatitis B vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-50246d" class="body-graf"&gt;Because of disagreements and confusion over the voting language, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's panel, formally known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, decided to push the vote to Friday morning instead of holding it Thursday afternoon as scheduled. The committee had previously tabled a September vote on the hepatitis B vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2fa06d" class="body-graf"&gt;The meeting was, in numerous ways, a radical departure from past practices. Typically, the ACIP evaluates new vaccines or new indications for them, not shots that have been administered in the same way for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f8c24" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC has for 34 years recommended that all newborns get a first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. But the panel is considering whether to roll back that guidance and instead suggest that women who test negative for hepatitis B decide in consultation with a health care provider whether their baby should get the dose at birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a3d2b" class="body-graf"&gt;If adopted, that recommendation would go against widespread consensus among public health experts, who before the meeting issued loud pleas not to change the hepatitis B vaccination schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9cd393" class="body-graf"&gt;On Thursday, the advisory panel convened in the CDC’s broadcast studio, under bright lights and in front of large television cameras, instead of its typical conference room — giving the appearance of a televised show rather than a scientific discussion. When asked about the venue, Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said it was meant to “accommodate increased public interest in the committee.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-08f313" class="body-graf"&gt;The proceedings featured a barrage of misleading claims and cherry-picked data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2acbd5" class="body-graf"&gt;Several presenters and panel members claimed there was limited evidence of the hepatitis B vaccine’s safety or efficacy, ignoring decades of evidence to the contrary. At past meetings, the CDC’s medical experts have presented data on the risks of a given disease and the safety and efficacy of vaccines that target it. But the presentations Thursday were instead given by two anti-vaccine activists and a climate scientist who has written for an anti-vaccine publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8cf0bb" class="body-graf"&gt;The meeting was the most blatant example to date of how far the panel has strayed from its original mission to consider who should get vaccines — and when — based on a complete scientific analysis of the risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-05646b" class="body-graf"&gt;In a presentation on safety, anti-vaccine activist Mark Blaxill — a businessman and author with no medical credentials who was recently hired at the CDC — suggested that symptoms identified in babies who got the hepatitis B vaccine, such as fatigue, weakness, diarrhea or irritability were “possibly connected” to swelling of the brain, or encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bbe5af" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, the only ACIP member who has previously served on the committee, pushed back: “That is absolutely not encephalitis,” he said. “That’s not a statement that a physician would make. They are not related to encephalitis, and you can’t say that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f59be7" class="body-graf"&gt;By early afternoon, multiple members of the committee expressed confusion over what they were voting on and pointed to issues with the voting language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c58dc3" class="body-graf"&gt;“Perhaps this was written by the department of redundancy department,” quipped ACIP member Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc9a0b" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel’s chair, Dr. Kirk Milhoan, was not present for the decision to postpone the hepatitis B vote. Vice chair Dr. Robert Malone said Milhoan was “about to jump on a plane to go to Asia and would not be available, I believe, for [the discussion] tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-b049eb"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1666" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg" alt="US Vaccine Panel Poised To Delay Hepatitis B Shots For Newborns"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Committee member Dr. Robert Malone at Thursday's meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Megan Varner / Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-908310" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, commented during the meeting that the proceedings amounted to “political theater.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2f98f" class="body-graf"&gt;“You are wasting taxpayer dollars by not having scientific, rigorous discussion on issues that truly matter,” Goldman said. “The best thing you can do is adjourn the meeting and discuss vaccine issues that actually need to be taken up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad3349" class="body-graf"&gt;Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1996564037497491520" target="_blank"&gt;said on X&lt;/a&gt; before the meeting began that the advisory panel is “totally discredited” and “not protecting children.” Cassidy, a liver doctor who treated patients with hepatitis B, chairs the Senate’s health committee and cast a key vote in favor of confirming Kennedy as health secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8236c0" class="body-graf"&gt;Hepatitis B is an incurable infection that can lead to liver disease, cancer and death. The virus can be transmitted from mother to child during delivery, and not all pregnant women get tested for it. So public health experts say that delaying the shots could lead to more infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-470a71" class="body-graf"&gt;The prevailing medical consensus is that hepatitis B vaccines are overwhelmingly safe, based on decades of real-world data. A CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of children born from 1994 to 2023 estimated that hepatitis B vaccination prevented more than 6 million infections and nearly 1 million hospitalizations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-613d59" class="body-graf"&gt;In addition to its vote on hepatitis B vaccines Friday, the CDC advisory panel is also expected to discuss the entire childhood immunization schedule, as well as the presence of aluminum salts found in many childhood vaccines, which help boost the immune response and reduce the number of required doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74a245" class="body-graf"&gt;Both are hot-button topics among anti-vaccine activists, who often argue that children receive too many vaccines and that aluminum salts in them increases the risk of autoimmune conditions or neurodevelopmental disorders. Neither claim is supported by scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8077e" class="body-graf"&gt;Aaron Siri, an anti-vaccine lawyer who has represented Kennedy, is expected to give a presentation Friday. Siri has advocated for the Food and Drug Administration to revoke its approval of the polio vaccine.

&lt;p&gt;There’s new progress in the battle against Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;About 1 in 9 US seniors&lt;/a&gt; has Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia, which slowly impairs memory, thinking skills and the ability to perform even basic tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is no single, easy test to diagnose Alzheimer’s, but a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2842195" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt; of 18 scientific studies confirms that a simple blood test can detect early signs of the brain disorder before &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/12/health/4-warning-signs-that-may-indicate-early-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;cognitive symptoms&lt;/a&gt; appear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Alzheimer’s disease gradually destroys memory, thinking skills and the ability to perform even basic tasks. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;WavebreakMediaMicro – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The protein p-tau217 has become a reliable Alzheimer’s biomarker because its concentration in the blood is strongly linked to the presence of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, two hallmarks of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research out this week in JAMA Neurology supports the use of p-tau217 blood tests as a “minimally invasive tool” for early identification of Alzheimer’s, “particularly in settings where timely intervention with disease-modifying therapies may offer the greatest benefit in slowing or preventing disease progression.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/liron-sinvani-md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Liron Sinvani&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Geriatric Hospitalist Service at Northwell Health and director of research for hospital medicine, called the finding “a major breakthrough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Just a simple blood test to see if this protein, this p-tau217, is present can indicate that someone is at a very high risk of having dementia right before symptoms even start,” said Sinvani, who was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is definitely a big finding in terms of, ‘OK. Can we identify people before they even have symptoms of dementia?'”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Blood tests are an up-and-coming method for identifying Alzheimer’s. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Yakobchuk Olena – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dementia symptoms can include memory loss, difficulties with familiar tasks, communication troubles, disorientation, poor judgment and mood or personality changes.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;An assessment of symptoms is used to diagnose Alzheimer’s, along with a review of health history and physical and neurological exams. Brain imaging and a spinal fluid analysis can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blood tests are an up-and-coming method for identifying Alzheimer’s, with the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration recently approving&lt;/a&gt; new blood testing for people 55 and older experiencing symptoms like memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;P-tau217 blood tests typically require a doctor’s order, though &lt;a href="https://truehealthlabs.com/phosphorylated-tau-217-ptau217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one sells online for $229&lt;/a&gt; with the promise that “no doctor or insurance is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new JAMA review, which included data from over 7,800 people, found that p-tau217 levels were much higher in amyloid-positive people than in amyloid-negative people, even though these individuals had no cognitive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dementia symptoms can include memory loss, difficulties with familiar tasks, communication troubles, disorientation, poor judgment and mood or personality changes. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amyloid plaques are clumps of misfolded proteins in the brain that can disrupt brain function.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s a tell-tale sign of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there’s no cure for amyloid plaques in the brain, though there are treatments that can reduce them in the early stages of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“The question in my mind is, at this moment, how many people would want to know that they have this biomarker and have a high risk of dementia?” Sinvani mused.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The reason why this isn’t ready for primetime is because we don’t have medications right now that would be offered,” she continued, “but the goal is that if we can identify people early enough, before they even start having symptoms, then we can potentially, hopefully as medications develop, be able to introduce medications that can prevent or slow down the progression.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there is no cure for Alzheimer’s, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/28/health/alzheimers-risk-declines-sharply-with-one-daily-lifestyle-change-researchers-say/"&gt;lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt; can lower the risk or potentially slow progression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A healthy diet, exercise, increased socialization, making connections and keeping your brain active,” Sinvani said, “these are all things that can impact the trajectory of dementia, and so, knowing that you are at very high risk could be a nice way to sort of incentivize people to start doing something about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7e03b13f-6208-4cc5-92b5-78cd070142cd"&gt;Researchers think they may have found a way to reverse "lazy eye," even in adults who've typically had the condition since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique has so far been tested only in animals, though, so it needs further study before it can be used in human patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="7e03b13f-6208-4cc5-92b5-78cd070142cd-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;A lazy eye, or amblyopia, develops when the brain favors one eye over the other &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lazy-eye/symptoms-causes/syc-20352391" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lazy-eye/symptoms-causes/syc-20352391" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in early childhood&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, causing vision in the less-favored &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/what-are-eyes-made-of" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/what-are-eyes-made-of"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eye&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to decline. The standard treatment involves placing a patch over the stronger eye to force the brain to rely on the weaker one. However, this method is effective only during infancy and early childhood, when the neural connections that regulate vision are still being formed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2346838d-9866-4817-8d4f-c541c97aa02c"&gt;Now, a mouse study published Nov. 25 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)01338-5" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)01338-5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; introduces a method for temporarily shutting down the weak eye, which can lead to recovery from amblyopia, even after long-term vision issues. "Rebooting" the lazy eye seems to come from a burst of activity in neurons that pass visual signals from the retina to the visual cortex, a hub for processing visual information in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The finding that inactivation of the amblyopic eye enables vision recovery in a mouse model of amblyopia is encouraging," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/profile/b7thomps" target="_blank" data-url="https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/profile/b7thomps" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ben Thompson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and the director of the School of Optometry and Vision Science at the University of Waterloo in Canada, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more research is needed to see whether the method will be safe and effective in humans, too, Thompson told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://optometry.berkeley.edu/people/dennis-m-levi-od-phd/" target="_blank" data-url="https://optometry.berkeley.edu/people/dennis-m-levi-od-phd/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Dennis Levi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of optometry and vision science at the University of California, Berkeley who was not involved in the study, was also cautiously optimistic about the findings. Historically, scientists have tried various methods of reversing lazy eye in mice, but they "failed to produce significant improvements in humans with amblyopia," he told Live Science in an email. But this new technique seems to hold promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-cnKEhdo8WE3US9KxxTNetF" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-cnKEhdo8WE3US9KxxTNetF slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how might temporarily shutting down the weak eye help to restore its vision?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/70023" target="_blank" data-url="https://elifesciences.org/articles/70023" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Earlier work&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from MIT neuroscientist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bearlab.mit.edu/mark-bear/" target="_blank" data-url="https://bearlab.mit.edu/mark-bear/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mark Bear&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues showed that anesthetizing the non-lazy eye triggered visual recovery in the lazy eye in older animals, including cats and mice. Similar results have been &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2799527" target="_blank" data-url="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2799527" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;found&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2799528" target="_blank" data-url="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2799528" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in monkeys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which may spell good news for humans, Levi noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the team hypothesized that blocking input from one retina causes neurons to fire in synchronized bursts in the thalamus, a part of the brain that handles incoming sensory information. Specifically, these bursts are seen in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), part of the brain that relays information from the eyes to the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar bursts happen in the LGN before birth and help the visual system develop in the womb. That led the team to wonder whether re-creating this early activity pattern could help treat amblyopia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tried injecting a local &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/33731-anesthesia-work.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/33731-anesthesia-work.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anesthetic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; called tetrodotoxin (TTX) into the retinas of mice and then monitored the rodents' LGN neurons. TTX is a neurotoxin found in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507714/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507714/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;animals like pufferfish&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it also has &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8402337/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8402337/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;potential therapeutic uses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including anesthesia and the treatment of severe pain. Research into these uses in humans is ongoing, but in the context of this study, TTX was useful for rebooting the retinas of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that shutting down either eye triggered the same burst pattern in the LGN. In a second experiment, they genetically modified the mice so their LGN neurons couldn't produce this burst firing. The activity stopped, and the anesthetic treatment no longer improved amblyopia. That showed that the bursts themselves were crucial for recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the team tested whether they could treat amblyopia by inactivating only the weak eye. They ran an experiment in which some mice with amblyopia got an injection in their weak eye while others did not. The injection stopped the retina from sending signals for about two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="814b5813-4ed3-486e-b8a4-a9895cb72e39"&gt;A week after the injection, the scientists measured how much each eye influenced activity in the visual cortex and found that the treated mice had a much more balanced input from both eyes than the untreated mice did. This showed that shutting down the weak eye for a short time helped it "catch up" with the other eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson said this result is encouraging "because the fellow eye does not have to be exposed to any risks of the treatment." But he emphasized that "more work is needed to assess whether tetrodotoxin will be safe and effective in humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that the effects of TTX on amblyopia generalize to cats and monkeys, raising hope that the approach may one day help humans as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery that burst firing can help boost the brain's ability to rewire and form new networks is "extremely interesting," Thompson said. Noninvasive tools used to stimulate the brain might eventually be harnessed to trigger similar neural responses, without the need for TTX injections, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="049c6ea2-bde5-4d76-a0fd-05dd95744052"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick and easy breath test to detect the difficult-to-diagnose pancreatic cancer is being trialed nationally in the UK with huge expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer has a high mortality rate among cancers because of the tendency to discover it at later stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has never been a breath test authorized by a major regulatory body like the British NIH or US Food and Drug Administration, but the initiative has far bigger aspirations than simply setting milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analysis of pancreatic cancer across the UK found that over 60% of cases are detected at stage 4. At this point, there’s not much to be done, and indeed, the same analysis found only 22% of patients diagnosed at this stage survive even a month beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to diagnose in part because it manifests in vague symptoms like backpain and indigestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imperial College London and Pancreatic Cancer UK are teaming up to launch a major trial of a new breath testing device in 40 different locations across the Scotland, Wales, and England, with a target for 6,000 patients. The breath test will detect volatile organic compounds, or VOCs that are linked with pancreatic cancer; even in early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of these VOCs travel around the bloodstream and can be expelled in a single breath. An analysis of the entire collection can pinpoint to cancer from other potential infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCER TESTING IMPROVEMENTS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The breath test has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of pancreatic cancer. It is, undoubtedly, the most significant step toward a lifesaving breakthrough in 50 years,” &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/pancreatic-cancer-breath-test-nhs-b2854162.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Diana Jupp, chief executive of Pancreatic Cancer UK which is funding the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While more years of development are still needed before we can put this exciting new technology into the hands of GPs across the country, thousands of patients with an unknown diagnosis will now help refine it in the real-world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the first pancreatic cancer breath test to ever reach a national clinical trial of this scale. That in itself makes this a moment of real, tangible hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHARE This Fantastic Potential For Advancing An Undertreated Disease… &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
