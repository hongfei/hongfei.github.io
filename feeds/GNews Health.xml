But because it’s always exposed, it also gets hit with things like sunlight and UV rays, which can lead to sunburn, long-term skin damage, or even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve long believed that stepping out into the sun requires ample sunscreen slathering, shade-seeking, and hat-wearing, especially between the peak hours of 12 noon and 3 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.ku.dk/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanyang Technological University&lt;/a&gt; (NTU Singapore) have made surprising new strides in our understanding of sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the DNA damage we’ve always associated with sunburn might not be the complete story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dna-rna-and-sunburn-damage"&gt;DNA, RNA, and sunburn damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to sunburn, the prevailing wisdom suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-can-now-collect-human-dna-from-water-air-and-basically-everywhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; damage triggers inflammation and subsequent cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this recent research suggests that the real offender might be &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rna-world-unraveling-mysteries-life-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RNA&lt;/a&gt;, not DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sunburn damages the DNA, leading to cell death and inflammation. So the textbooks say,” stated assistant professor Anna Constance Vind from the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at the &lt;a href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/organisations/institut-for-cellul%C3%A6r-og-molekyl%C3%A6r-medicin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But in this study we were surprised to learn that this is a result of damage to the RNA, not the DNA that causes the acute effects of sunburn.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what’s the difference between DNA and RNA? While they share similarities, the two aren’t interchangeable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA is a more consistent molecule, whereas RNA is more transitory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particular type of RNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), carries information from DNA to create proteins – the fundamental building blocks of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-rna-the-basics"&gt;Understanding RNA — the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rna-world-unraveling-mysteries-life-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RNA, or ribonucleic acid&lt;/a&gt;, is like the cell’s versatile messenger, playing several key roles in keeping our bodies running smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike DNA, which holds the long-term genetic blueprint, RNA is more dynamic and can move around the cell to help build proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA essentially acts as the bridge between our genetic code and the actual production of the proteins that do all the work in our cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-we-fix-faulty-genes-before-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mRNA&lt;/a&gt;, or messenger RNA, is a special type of RNA that has gained a lot of attention, especially with the development of mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;mRNA carries the instructions from DNA out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, where proteins are made. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of mRNA as a temporary copy of a specific gene that tells the cell exactly which protein to produce and when. This makes mRNA incredibly important for everything from growth and repair to responding to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mrna-and-ultraviolet-rays"&gt;mRNA and ultraviolet rays&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The importance of mRNA in our body’s response to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-does-skin-become-leathery-after-too-much-uv-light-from-sun-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UV radiation&lt;/a&gt; can’t be understated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DNA damage is serious as the mutations will get passed down to progenies of the cells, RNA damage happens all the time and does not cause permanent mutations,” Vind explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, we used to believe that the RNA is less important, as long as the DNA is intact. But in fact, damages to the RNA are the first to trigger a response to UV radiation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigating more deeply into the matter was no small task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers embarked on a study involving both mice and human skin cells to better understand the consequences of UV radiation on the skin. They discovered a consistent response in both species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zak-alpha-and-sunburn-damage"&gt;ZAK-alpha and sunburn damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA damage activates a response in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-the-cellular-mortality-timer-that-dictates-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ribosomes&lt;/a&gt; (protein complexes that interpret the mRNA to assemble proteins).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process is managed by a protein known as ZAK-alpha, which triggers what is referred to as the “ribotoxic stress response.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it like a vigilant watchman, always on the lookout for RNA damage. When it detects any, it won’t hesitate to call for backup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the first thing the cells respond to after being exposed to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-sunbathing-help-you-lose-weight-uv-radiation-triggers-fat-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UV radiation&lt;/a&gt; is damage to the RNA, and that this is what triggers cell death and inflammation of the skin,” explained Professor Simon Bekker-Jensen, who was also from the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice exposed to UV radiation we found responses such as inflammation and cell death, but when we removed the ZAK gene, these responses disappeared, which means that ZAK plays a key role in the skin’s response to UV-induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So you could say that everything depends on this one response, which monitors all protein translations occurring,” Bekker-Jensen elaborated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cells respond to the RNA damage, realizing that something is wrong, and this is what leads to cell death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paradigm-shift"&gt;Paradigm shift&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings question our long-held beliefs about sunburn and how our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/skins-secret-strength-shields-against-puncture-damage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; safeguards itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It suggests that RNA damage sparks a quicker, more efficient response, which safeguards the skin from additional harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that the DNA does not control the skin’s initial response to UV radiation, but that something else does and that it does so more effectively and more quickly, is quite the paradigm shift,” reflected Vind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/01/24163120/sunburn-study_graphical-illustration_credit-Molecular-Cell-Journal_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/01/24163127/sunburn-study_graphical-illustration_credit-Molecular-Cell-Journal_1s.webp" alt="Using ZAK knockout mice, we here show that it is the RSR that is responsible for the early manifestation of UVB-induced skin inflammation and keratinocyte death and subsequent proliferation in vivo.

Credit: Molecular Cell Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing how our skin reacts to UV damage at a cellular level could potentially transform prevention and treatment approaches to sunburn and other inflammatory skin conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many inflammatory skin diseases are worsened by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/many-parents-are-not-using-sunscreen-properly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sun exposure&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, understanding how our skin responds at the cellular level to UV damage opens the door to innovative treatments for certain chronic skin conditions,” explained Dr. Franklin Zhong, Nanyang assistant professor at NTU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine and a co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rewriting-the-textbooks"&gt;Rewriting the textbooks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In closing, it seems now is the time to revise our textbooks and rethink how we perceive the effects of UV radiation on our skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new knowledge turns things upside down. I think most people associate sunburn with DNA damage; it is established knowledge,” Professor Simon Bekker-Jensen concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But now we need to rewrite the textbooks, and it will affect future research on the effects of UV radiation on the skin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1097276524008840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Molecular Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 21:13:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPc2MyMVB2SW9NQkZSWGpvOFJPaTQ3eldXRmVEY3NFaHFhNHhraFlQQmQzNjBicy1CQ1BmRGtNemJHVmRZYUN3ekxuRy1aX0c0ai1yQVFkQk9oRkhqeWxBX3NDVHJuNEppeWhYOUpueWhudDE4Y3JuNnk1OUdLd1JFX0pPX2dkZE1MX2RLRTlMVVo</guid></item><item><title>由于疫苗接种率低，科罗拉多州部分地区的麻疹风险与西德克萨斯州一样高-《丹佛邮报》 | Parts of Colorado face measles risk as high as West Texas due to low vaccination rates - The Denver Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxOc0ppX1NVWkJDRk5heFFZbnN2VldjLW0zWHAzYzNHMmNNbFI3OEtDS2hnVDI0OHFRNzg5b2xPdW5sMWpaZl82Tlk1TFhCX3FPVWpjbFQ5T0UwSElJUklnUWxTbjlKeEF4cGktM0NFRzhzcWRtVHZQQm9KMFo0UVZVV0RQOHM4U01ieW5UN9IBkgFBVV95cUxQbS1wamZHeldCUHlIaklscDVtWUUzNFo2Z3lSdjhMYkYzRzQ2aTJES1ppeGhuejRTM3RkOXZqanpQUkQ1ak4wZTFuMl9FekFLLVYxZDRsMTlQeGVCQ2ROdjFpMGxySVNpTzk2QUE3WkxSUk1CV3hxUk90RDVFTWVxQlhYMF9FMzBzS2xzTGFBaHBIdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parts of Colorado are as vulnerable to measles as West Texas, where the highly contagious virus has infected hundreds of people and killed two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has recorded more confirmed measles cases so far this year than it has in almost two decades. Rural pockets of the state are undervaccinated, and large counties have seen their protection erode since the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country as a whole has more than three times as many measles cases already this year as it did in all of 2024, and federal health officials are pushing vitamins as an alternative to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think what’s clear is, we’re going backwards,” said Beth Carlton, chair of environmental and occupational health at the &lt;a href="https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/"&gt;Colorado School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re creating conditions where we have the right ingredients for measles to spread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statewide, about 94% of Colorado students in preschool through 12th grade were up-to-date on their measles shots in the 2023-2024 school year, creating an imperfect but relatively solid wall around people with compromised immune systems and babies too young for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that average conceals more-vulnerable pockets in the state: in two counties, one-quarter of children didn’t have their shots, and in eight schools, less than half did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 25 years, communities typically didn’t see any consequences from those low rates. Measles no longer circulated in the United States, and outbreaks popped up only when travelers brought the virus back. While public health officials warned that declining vaccination rates could set the stage for the virus to start circulating widely again, Colorado reported only six people who had measles &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/measles"&gt;between 2014 and 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those days may be over. As of Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;measles had infected 1,046 people&lt;/a&gt; across the United States, and public health officials have started to worry that the outbreak could last into 2026.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has confirmed five measles cases since January, making this the first time since 1996 that the state had more than two in a single year. Those infected include an &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/31/colorado-measles-pueblo-outbreak-public-health-mmr-vaccine/"&gt;adult in Pueblo County&lt;/a&gt;; a Denver baby and &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/23/denver-measles-case-colorado/"&gt;an unidentified person&lt;/a&gt; who lives in the same household; a &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/25/colorado-measles-denver-lakewood-exposure/"&gt;Denver adult&lt;/a&gt;; and an adult in Archuleta County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials also warned the public last week about two infected and contagious travelers who recently visited Colorado: a person from another state who &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/05/21/measles-pueblo-hotel-holiday-inn/"&gt;stayed at a Pueblo hotel on May 9 and 10&lt;/a&gt;, and an international traveler who &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/05/22/denver-measles-dia-colorado-quality-inn-airport/"&gt;passed through Denver International Airport and stayed at a nearby hotel&lt;/a&gt; on May 13 and 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the state’s confirmed measles patients got sick after visiting Mexico, though the &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/08/denver-health-measles-emergency-room/"&gt;Archuleta County adult hadn’t traveled&lt;/a&gt;, which raises concerns about missed cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, uptake of routine vaccines &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/155/4/e2024068244/201312/COVID-19-and-Completion-of-Select-Routine"&gt;still hadn’t rebounded from a pandemic dip&lt;/a&gt; as of 2023, and resistance to COVID-19 vaccines led to increased skepticism of shots that once had bipartisan support. State legislatures have considered expanding exemptions to school vaccination requirements or &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/state-lawmakers-see-new-opportunities-to-pass-vaccine-exemptions-after-trumps-return"&gt;forbidding “discrimination” based on being unvaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, and a bill in Minnesota would have classified one type of vaccine technology as a &lt;a href="https://www.twincities.com/2025/04/24/umn-disease-research-center-to-launch-vaccine-integrity-project/"&gt;“weapon of mass destruction.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials in the Trump administration have been lukewarm in endorsing the shots as a way to stem the current outbreak. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promoted misinformation that vaccines cause autism and falsely claimed that vitamin A could prevent measles, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/kennedy-vaccines-research.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Dk8.NeR6.HBiMh-SBxZlz&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;framed vaccination as a personal choice, with no clear correct answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two shots of the measles vaccine are about 97% effective in preventing infection and virtually eliminate the risk of serious complications, such as pneumonia and neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At current vaccination rates, a series of simulations published by the Journal of the American Medical Association gave measles an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833361?guestAccessKey=5d34848e-bd4f-4cba-ac24-685fadb45a1c&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=postup_jn&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_alert-jama&amp;amp;utm_content=olf&amp;amp;utm_term=042425&amp;amp;utm_adv="&gt;83% chance of reestablishing a permanent presence&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, with an estimated 850,000 cases and 2,500 deaths projected over the next 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rates would only have to rise about 5% to prevent reestablishment and knock cases down to a few thousand in the next quarter century, the scientists running the simulation said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models never reflect reality perfectly, but seeing such a high risk from a simulation that used relatively conservative estimates is worrisome, Carlton said. As outbreaks continue to spread in other states, and possibly in countries that have lost American aid for their health systems, Colorado communities will face an increased risk of imported cases that could turn into outbreaks if they land among undervaccinated people, she said. Essentially, they’ll roll the dice more often, and their luck could eventually run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, parents who weren’t sure about measles shots may opt for them when the virus no longer seems like a far-off risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lauren Brave, a pediatrician in Boulder County, said a few already are starting to make that calculation. Two families in her practice who’d decided not to vaccinate their children against measles recently changed their minds, and others have said they’ll come in for the shots if cases start popping up closer to home, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All parents are just trying to protect their kids, so when people hear scary things online, it plays to their natural parental fears,” she said. “It’s a long game” to get children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Striving for herd immunity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health officials cite 95% vaccine coverage as the threshold for herd immunity — the point where a virus can’t find new hosts to allow it to jump from one susceptible person to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most things in nature, however, herd immunity isn’t quite that clear-cut, said Dr. David Higgins, a pediatrician and preventive medicine specialist on the &lt;a href="https://www.cuanschutz.edu/"&gt;University of Colorado’s Anschutz Medical Campus&lt;/a&gt;. A community where 90% of children are up-to-date on their measles shots isn’t as protected as one where 95% are, but it is safer than a community where 80% are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a light switch, on or off. It’s more of a dimmer,” he said of vaccination levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 23 large and small counties scattered around Colorado, K-12 students met the herd immunity threshold in the 2023-2024 school year, which was the most recent with data. In the Denver area, Broomfield, Adams and Douglas counties had at least 95% of their students vaccinated against measles, while Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe counties fell between 93% and 95%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the opposite end, in 13 counties, at least one in 10 K-12 students didn’t have full protection against measles, and in Hinsdale and Dolores counties in the state’s southwest corner, more than one in four didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual rates may be lower, because states collect vaccination data through their public schools, and rates tend to be lower for kids attending private schools or who are homeschooled, said Dr. Michelle Fiscus, chief medical officer at the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/"&gt;Association of Immunization Managers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracy Beanland, director of &lt;a href="https://dolocnty.colorado.gov/public-health"&gt;Dolores County Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, said last year’s rates don’t reflect progress the county has made since 2023. In the current school year, all children were up to date on their measles shots, she said. The county has about 600 children attending public schools, which makes large swings in the vaccination rate more likely than in urban areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Hinsdale County didn’t respond to questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even county and district averages can conceal unprotected pockets. In Saguache County in the San Luis Valley, about 88% of students were up-to-date on their measles shots, but only 60% were in tiny &lt;a href="https://www.moffatschools.org/"&gt;Moffat School District C-2&lt;/a&gt; — and only 20% were in the district’s &lt;a href="https://www.crestone-charter-school.org/"&gt;Crestone Charter School&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulnerable pockets don’t only appear in rural areas. While almost 96% of K-12 students in Adams County had their measles shots, at &lt;a href="https://ebabrighton.org/"&gt;Elmwood Baptist Academy&lt;/a&gt; in Brighton, only 30% did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern existed in Texas. In Gaines County — the epicenter of the current outbreak — about 90% of public school students were up-to-date on their measles vaccine by middle school, but fewer than half of students had their shots in a few individual schools. (Texas only publishes vaccination rates for kindergarteners and seventh graders.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communities can nudge people who don’t have strong feelings about vaccines in either direction, Higgins said. People who send their children to the same school or child care center tend to have similar media diets, meaning that interacting with other parents can reinforce either facts or misinformation, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that social norms within communities are strong motivators for health behavior,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Rates drop in large counties&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have fallen in Colorado’s larger counties since the 2017-2018 school year, with most of the decline happening since the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 16 counties with at least 50,000 residents, eight saw a statistically significant drop in their K-12 measles vaccination rate. Six remained stable, and Boulder and Garfield counties increased their vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boulder County started working with neighboring counties and the &lt;a href="https://www.bvsd.org/"&gt;Boulder Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.svvsd.org/"&gt;St. Vrain Valley&lt;/a&gt; school districts on measles back in 2019, which was the last time the United States had major outbreaks, said Stephanie Faren, manager of the communicable disease and emergency management division at &lt;a href="https://bouldercounty.gov/departments/public-health/"&gt;Boulder County Public Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 90.7% of students across Boulder County had their measles shots during the 2017-2018 school year, but in the most recent year, 94.9% did, putting herd immunity in reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the improvement was on paper, as the department got a more accurate count of children who’d received their shots, but part represented a real change, Faren said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminding parents when their children were due for shots was an effective measure, because measles just wasn’t top of mind for everyone, Faren said. The health departments also worked with health care providers so they’d feel prepared to field their patients’ questions and concerns, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Boulder was one of the first areas where vaccine hesitancy and sort of a natural health movement started,” she said. “But it’s also a highly educated community with a lot of health-minded people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arapahoe and El Paso counties had the steepest drops in vaccination rates among the large Colorado counties, to about 93% and 90%, respectively. (Rural counties see more fluctuation because of their small populations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristi Durbin, immunization and travel division manager at &lt;a href="https://www.elpasocountyhealth.org/"&gt;El Paso County Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, said parents delayed routine health care during the pandemic. The department has been sending reminders to families that are behind on shots and offering vaccine clinics at schools and community organizations, to make it easier to catch up, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“EPCPH saw many 13-year-olds coming in for vaccines they should have received around 11, or 6- and 7-year-olds who missed their kindergarten routine immunizations, which includes the (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine,” she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;“Make it as convenient as possible”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some families fell behind on shots because they have difficulty finding a provider who stocks all the vaccines their children need, said Kaitlin Wolff, immunization nurse manager for &lt;a href="https://www.arapahoeco.gov/your_county/county_departments/public_health_department/index.php"&gt;Arapahoe County Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve also seen an increase in parents who aren’t opposed to vaccines, but want to set their own schedule — though that trend may be reversing now that they’re hearing about children hospitalized because of measles, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we don’t have a disease circulating, a slight delay presents no problem,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arapahoe County’s health department has worked with schools for years to bring the shots to children whose parents don’t have the time or transportation to take them to a doctor, Wolff said. They’ve also reached out to religious communities and partnered with community health workers, who help people in specific populations to navigate the health system, to reach immigrants who speak a language other than English or Spanish, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As humans, we are most impacted (in our decisions) by people close to us,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines may not be a family’s top priority, so some of the most successful efforts bring the shots to places that are already meeting their other needs, said Sarah Waraniak, program director of &lt;a href="https://www.immunizecolorado.org/"&gt;Immunize Colorado&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the group and its partners gave out about 7,300 shots at more than 70 clinics around the Denver area, including a food box distribution site off Colfax Avenue and “community baby showers” where low-income mothers-to-be can pick up gear, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to make it as convenient as possible,” Waraniak said. “We find that does tend to drive rates up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right strategies to boost vaccination rates will depend on families’ reasons for not getting their children vaccinated, said Fiscus, with the Association of Immunization Managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outreach geared toward specific religious groups, such as Orthodox Jews in New York or the Amish community in Pennsylvania, has helped persuade members to accept the vaccine during outbreaks. In other places, such as Chicago, offering vaccine clinics during the school day helped catch kids up, because parents didn’t have to worry about taking time off work or finding transportation, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You really have to be using micro-level data and planning,” Fiscus said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal funding cuts to public health will limit state and local agencies’ ability to do that sort of work, though, said Carlton, with the Colorado School of Public Health. So will the &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/19/cu-anschutz-colorado-research-nih-grants-vaccines-alzheimers/"&gt;Trump administration’s decision to end federal support&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/05/05/denver-vaccine-hesitancy-study-stopped-trump/"&gt;research on vaccine hesitancy and trust&lt;/a&gt;, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel like it is the elephant in the room,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man in his 30s from the United Kingdom experienced an unusual and medically rare complication after attempting to suppress a sneeze while behind the wheel.  Struggling with hay fever symptoms, he pinched his nose and closed his mouth to contain the reflex, an action that appeared harmless but resulted in a serious internal injury. According to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/diagnostic-dilemma-a-man-held-in-a-sneeze-and-it-punctured-his-windpipe" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.livescience.com/health/diagnostic-dilemma-a-man-held-in-a-sneeze-and-it-punctured-his-windpipe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Live Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, this maneuver led to a spontaneous rupture of his &lt;em&gt;windpipe&lt;/em&gt;, an outcome rarely observed without external trauma. The event initiated a cascade of clinical investigations and raised concerns among doctors about the hidden dangers of interfering with such a natural reflex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Symptoms and Initial Findings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patient arrived at the emergency department with &lt;em&gt;severe neck pain&lt;/em&gt;, a visibly &lt;em&gt;swollen neck&lt;/em&gt;, and he reported he could &lt;em&gt;barely move his neck&lt;/em&gt; due to discomfort. Despite these symptoms, he was able to &lt;em&gt;breathe, swallow, and speak normally&lt;/em&gt;. Upon physical examination, physicians noted a &lt;em&gt;faint crackling sound&lt;/em&gt;—a clinical sign indicating that &lt;em&gt;air had escaped into soft tissues&lt;/em&gt;. Initial &lt;em&gt;X-rays&lt;/em&gt; revealed &lt;em&gt;surgical emphysema&lt;/em&gt;, a condition where air is trapped under the skin’s deepest tissue layers.

&lt;p&gt;This tear allowed air to escape from the trachea into the surrounding tissues and into the mediastinum. According to the physicians’ report, the rupture was caused by a “rapid build-up of pressure in the &lt;em&gt;trachea&lt;/em&gt; while sneezing with a pinched nose and closed mouth.” This intense pressure likely caused a tear in the &lt;em&gt;windpipe&lt;/em&gt;, allowing air to escape into surrounding tissues. Estimates suggest this action can create pressures more than 20 times higher than those generated during a typical “achoo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Hospital Treatment and Follow-Up&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors opted against surgery, instead placing the patient under close observation for &lt;em&gt;two days&lt;/em&gt;. During this period, he was &lt;em&gt;not permitted to eat or drink&lt;/em&gt; for the first 24 hours and was monitored for vital signs and oxygen saturation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was later discharged with &lt;em&gt;pain relief&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;hay fever medications&lt;/em&gt;, and advised to &lt;em&gt;avoid strenuous physical activity for two weeks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;five-week follow-up CT scan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; confirmed that the tear had &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;completely healed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Sneeze That Led to an Unexpected Medical Emergency&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous tracheal tears are &lt;em&gt;rarely reported in &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/after-a-knee-surgery-this-teenager-wakes-up-speaking-a-foreign-language-and-has-forgotten-his-mother-tongue/" data-type="post" data-id="77052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;medical literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Previous documented cases were typically linked to &lt;em&gt;external trauma&lt;/em&gt;, or occurred as &lt;em&gt;complications from medical interventions&lt;/em&gt; such as &lt;em&gt;thyroidectomy&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;intubation&lt;/em&gt;.  To the authors’ knowledge, no prior cases have involved tracheal rupture solely due to stifling a sneeze. In their report, the doctors issued a direct warning, stating: “&lt;em&gt;Everyone should be advised not to stifle sneezes by pinching the nose while keeping the mouth closed as it can result in tracheal perforation.&lt;/em&gt;” This case illustrates how everyday actions, when done improperly, can lead to unexpected and medically significant consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

When he emerged in a disoriented fog, he realized that his perception of time had unraveled way more than he had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The curious results from his subterranean stay turned into a whole new chapter in the study of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/chronobiology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronobiology&lt;/a&gt;, which examines how living creatures keep time within their bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michel found himself at the center of a movement that would later connect to everything from jet lag to space travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-surprising-pursuit"&gt;A surprising pursuit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1963, Siffre planned to stay underground for 15 days to study a glacier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He soon realized that this time would not be enough, so he decided to push past normal limits and live beneath the surface for more than two months, relying on basic supplies and no timekeeping devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to understand, I was a geologist by training,” said Siffre. He stripped away external markers of day and night, and was content to note his daily activities while losing track of how the outside world ticked along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unlocking-an-internal-clock"&gt;Unlocking an internal clock&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;His most astonishing takeaway was that people have a personal timer that keeps ticking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separated from sunrise, standard schedules, and everyday routines, he uncovered an internal clock that slowly drifted beyond the standard 24-hour day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without knowing it, I […] created the field of human chronobiology,” explained Siffre. Free from external prompts, his &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519507/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt; slid into a longer pattern, suggesting that our bodies don’t always stick to the planet’s day-night spin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-body-s-clock-works-differently-in-isolation"&gt;The body’s clock works differently in isolation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-are-falling-in-love-with-ai-companions-and-it-could-be-dangerous/"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who followed Siffre’s method – and sometimes worked alongside him – saw similar results. Their sleep-wake cycles bent and stretched, sometimes reaching absurd lengths, including instances of 33 hours of sleep and 72 hours of wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One subject even wore a microphone, prompting panic when he didn’t stir for more than a day. Researchers initially feared he had died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These unpredictable shifts proved that the body’s timing system operates independently and erratically when left to its own devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unexpected-interest-in-internal-clock-findings"&gt;Unexpected interest in internal clock findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cold War era was in full swing, and NASA wanted to understand how astronauts might cope with time shifts away from Earth’s regular day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military programs also became curious about best practices for submariners, who spent lengthy intervals away from natural light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research teams observed that these extended hours of wakefulness and rest could pose unique challenges, and support arrived swiftly to probe deeper into what happens when people are removed from typical time cues. &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/Investigation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;’s backing highlighted the immediate value of Siffre’s discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-relevance-in-modern-science"&gt;Relevance in modern science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, scientists continue exploring how disrupted sleep patterns can throw off hormone levels, mood, and even immune function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shift workers benefit from an understanding of these natural cycles, and knowledge gleaned from cave experiments helps guide strategies to minimize fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts also link out-of-sync body clocks with heightened health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2017/press-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; recognized further breakthroughs on the genetics behind internal clocks, also known as circadian cycles. This gave a nod to the foundations laid by bold adventurers like Siffre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-criticism-and-caution"&gt;Criticism and caution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From day one, his work stirred a lot of chatter. Some observers argued that his approach seemed reckless or theatrical, while others worried that placing people in such extreme isolation might bring undue stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions were also raised about the potential effect of human presence on delicate underground life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the push to clarify how biology maintains &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/physicists-confirm-the-incredible-existence-of-time-mirrors/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; overshadowed those doubts, and Siffre’s name became associated with gritty persistence and unexpected scientific impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-siffre-s-legacy-of-timing"&gt;Siffre’s legacy of timing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;His method won supporters who saw its practical side. There was particular excitement over data on how the body adapts when divorced from external time prompts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This offered a window into biological machinery that touches nearly every corner of health and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He showed that patterns of rest and activity can stray far from the familiar 24-hour day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, he demonstrated how resilient people can be when conventional signals are stripped away, sparking conversations among physiologists, psychologists, and government agencies alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reflections-on-exploration"&gt;Reflections on exploration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siffre’s work revealed that stepping away from clocks goes beyond missing a few appointments. It underscored how powerfully our inner timer enforces its own schedule, even when we don’t realize what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These revelations opened the door to studies on how rhythms shift during space missions or across hectic flight schedules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They offered practical solutions to reduce the strain of unusual work shifts, prevent mental fog, and potentially lower disease risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He never expected a geological side-trip to ignite a deeper understanding of how the human system handles &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/negative-time-observed-measured-tangible-in-new-quantum-experiments/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the power of curiosity – and a willingness to live alone in absolute darkness – proved that we can learn much by trading daylight for the faint glow of a single lamp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 15:06:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxOZ2ZQS3ZWS1JwalZyV0NRVzRBalpvakU2UTJ3ZTJ3TmtmbU8tN3E0QWl5cDhFNlFlTkRxWXdweDJOdldwdklxMndWOHp1ekgzaU1lVDd5M2h6blZDV1FGS2FtM3lUUXc0Y1Q2QjRzNGJZcEJTMWdnQ0VtVGkyOW0xR3F5ZWFJYTdOcDdKQ1gyYkpsNUp4cnhVamJhVUdCTTBYNDRLaHMxd0VuUGh4eXRkcHlUMkxmSEdxOGdSQ0VSZlM5anNqbmc</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，减少炎症的最佳高蛋白早餐- EatingWell | The Best High-Protein Breakfast to Reduce Inflammation, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNcDBKVXBNT3hyTm9uNmtMN1ktMEdsZ29qMmZGbGpROVdCU0dxZ1FzTEFsWTM2aC1INkFiMXJEMVo2b1NhVGxsSjJkY3RnUUx2eFBNZTdSU0J6dE1oTUQ5RUNXR3dGTDNTekdoRV9HSm9qX1RGeUhYcGdPbTJaeExzYUV1ajU5YUJmYUhMRmZzYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A nourishing breakfast is a great way to set the tone for your day. And one of our faves is this five-star &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/roasted-vegetable-breakfast-grain-bowl-8742347" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;High-Protein Anti-Inflammatory Breakfast Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to packing 21 grams of protein for energy and satiety, this colorful recipe is loaded with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292071/the-best-foods-to-eat-to-fight-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;anti-inflammatory nutrients&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why does inflammation matter? In the short term, inflammation is a normal response to harmful things like infections or injuries, as it’s your body's natural way of healing itself. However, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7908104/understanding-acute-vs-chronic-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic, long-term inflammation&lt;/a&gt; can cause harm over time, potentially leading to cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, joint issues and more.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This bowl is packed with a winning combo of protein plus inflammation-fighting nutrients to keep you strong, healthy and energized for the short and long term.  So, whip one up and get ready to seize the day!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-we-love-this-anti-inflammatory-breakfast-bowl"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why We Love This Anti-Inflammatory Breakfast Bowl &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This plant-forward breakfast bowl features a blend of roasted acorn squash and broccoli, black beans, beets, fluffy quinoa and a perfectly cooked egg. To round things all out, it’s drizzled with a creamy tahini sauce. Here are a few more reasons we’re such big fans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting enough protein helps stabilize your blood sugar and keeps mid-morning hunger at bay. Each serving of this recipe provides 21 grams of protein, thanks to the egg, black beans and quinoa. Both the eggs and quinoa offer &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;complete protein&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids your body needs.  “High quality sources of protein provide essential amino acids, like leucine, isoleucine and valine, needed to build and repair tissues, regulate immune responses and produce anti-inflammatory compounds in the body,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirbie-daily/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Kirbie Daily, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the protein in black beans is incomplete, don’t underestimate them. These healthy legumes provide &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant protein&lt;/a&gt;, shown to provide a long list of health benefits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Rich in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows fiber plays a key role in reducing inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It also keeps you full and satisfied and can help kick-start your digestive system to get things going in the morning. Yet, few of us get the recommended 25 to 38 grams we need per day. And talk about a recipe that’s jam-packed with it! Each of these breakfast bowls touts an impressive 16 grams worth. Ingredients like acorn squash, broccoli, beans and quinoa contribute a mix of both &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble and insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; for multiple health benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Packed with Anti-Inflammatory Veggies &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recipe delivers a hefty dose of colorful vegetables that are rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047144/best-anti-inflammatory-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation-fighting nutrients&lt;/a&gt; and plant compounds. Let’s start with acorn squash. It’s filled with vitamin A and vitamin C, two antioxidants that help combat oxidative stress and support the immune system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Then there are beets. Their vibrant, dark hue comes from plant pigments called betalains that act as antioxidants to protect cells from damage. “Not only are beets a fantastic source of antioxidants like vitamins C and A, but they are also rich in dietary nitrates,” says Daily. “Our body naturally converts dietary nitrates to nitric oxide, a molecule that improves blood flow and helps lower inflammation.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And let’s not forget broccoli. This anti-inflammatory powerhouse is rich in sulforaphane, a plant chemical that may tame inflammation by encouraging the growth of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/#:~:text=Probiotics%20are%20the%20beneficial%20bacteria,good%20bacteria%20to%20your%20gut." class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;good gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Make-Ahead Friendly &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This breakfast bowl is super meal-prep friendly. You can roast the vegetables and cook the quinoa in advance, then quickly reheat and top with a freshly fried or poached egg in the morning. To save even more time, you can also batch-cook the eggs and tahini up to two days in advance. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Feel free to switch things up, too! You can swap the quinoa for farro or brown rice, add avocado for even more healthy fats, or top it with a dollop of plain Greek yogurt instead of the tahini sauce for extra protein. If you prefer a vegan version, simply replace the egg with a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/tofu-scramble-8559643" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tofu scramble.&lt;/a&gt;

Gin has its origins in Europe centuries ago and is produced by distilling neutral grain spirit with juniper and other botanicals such as coriander, angelica root, and citrus peel. Gin exists in various styles, including London Dry, Old Tom, and Plymouth gin. Traditionally, gin contains between 37.5% and 47% ABV of alcohol, making it a very good all-around base spirit for most classic cocktails, such as the Martini and Gin &amp;amp; Tonic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>慢性压力悄然增加您的中风风险-神经科学新闻 | Chronic Stress Quietly Raises Your Stroke Risk - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5JOUctNU9JOEJjN0k3TTQyVHh0Nmo0OVdCNW1PYV9vcm1TaDNrcE5fTnB6bUJRSXUzWllHSGpyanAxQXc4SHZFbWZ2ZGRKUW5MR3h3aEt4YWpUTEtOQUpNQzVRVEJUUGc3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Chronic stress is increasingly recognized as a contributor to stroke risk by intensifying conditions like high blood pressure, inflammation, and unhealthy lifestyle habits. While stress isn’t as easily measured as cholesterol or blood pressure, long-term exposure to it can set the stage for vascular damage and increase both ischemic and, less commonly, hemorrhagic stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals in lower socioeconomic groups often face compounded stressors, making them especially vulnerable. Managing stress through daily habits, mindfulness, and professional support may play a key role in reducing stroke risk and supporting overall cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indirect Risk Factor:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress raises stroke risk by worsening blood pressure, inflammation, and lifestyle habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disparity in Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; People in lower socioeconomic conditions are more vulnerable to stress-related health consequences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventive Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Simple stress-management strategies may support stroke prevention efforts alongside traditional risk factor control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Rochester&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the U.S. And while we often hear about risk factors like high blood pressure , elevated cholesterol levels, and smoking, there’s another that often flies under the radar: stress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to draw a straight line between a stressful event and a stroke,” says Dr. Curtis Benesch, Medical Director of UR Medicine’s Comprehensive Stroke Center since its start in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110386"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee.jpg" alt="This shows a stressed woman." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/stress-stroke-neurosicncee-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While chronic stress is more strongly linked to ischemic stroke, there is evidence that extreme acute stress—like experiencing violence, a car accident, or a natural disaster—may increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding in the brain). Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But when you look at large populations, there is a clear, statistically significant association between chronic stress and stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how something as intangible as stress might affect something as serious as a stroke—and what steps you can take to protect your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can Long-Term Stress Raise Your Risk of Stroke?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, chronic stress can increase your risk of stroke, but not in a direct way. Dr. Benesch explains that long-term stress contributes to common stroke risk factors like high blood pressure, poor sleep, unhealthy habits, and systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this can lead to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), which raises your risk for an ischemic stroke, the most common type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have a ‘stress meter’ like we have a blood pressure cuff, but what we do know is that high levels of chronic stress correlate with higher rates of stroke and cardiovascular disease,” says Dr. Benesch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Happens To Your Body When You’re Stressed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re under stress, your body releases stress hormones like epinephrine (better known as adrenaline) and cortisol. These hormones are helpful in short bursts—they help us react to danger—but when they’re constantly elevated, they can:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raise your blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elevate blood sugar levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promote inflammation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Encourage blood clot formation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these factors contribute to vascular damage and, ultimately, higher stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can a Scary or Traumatic Event Cause a Stroke?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chronic stress is more strongly linked to ischemic stroke, there is evidence that extreme acute stress—like experiencing violence, a car accident, or a natural disaster—may increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding in the brain).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see these extreme acute responses more often in cardiac events, like heart attacks or ‘broken heart syndrome,’” Dr. Benesch says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In stroke, it’s less common, but if a person has very high blood pressure and a vulnerable blood vessel, severe stress could trigger a hemorrhagic event.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are Some People More Vulnerable to Stress-Related Health Risks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Research shows that people in lower socioeconomic groups may be more vulnerable to stress-related stroke. Factors like financial instability, unsafe housing, or lack of access to healthcare can contribute to chronic stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For someone who doesn’t worry about the cost of eggs, that stressor might not register. But for someone on a tight budget, that daily worry adds up,” says Dr. Benesch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are systemic factors that contribute to chronic stress and, in turn, increase health risks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Does Stress Affect Your Risk for Stroke?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress can sneak into every part of your life, making it more likely you will trade healthy habits for those that raise your risk of stroke, like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor diet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of exercise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking or drinking more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skipping medications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding doctor visits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These habits create a ripple effect, worsening major stroke risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can Managing Stress Help Prevent Stroke?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While stress alone isn’t typically listed as a stroke risk factor in clinical guidelines, managing it is essential for overall cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But if you’re not sleeping, not eating well, and not taking care of yourself, that stress is clearly affecting your health,” says Dr. Benesch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends simple strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find an activity that brings you joy, like reading, gardening, or spending time with family.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try mindfulness techniques if that appeals to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talk to a doctor or mental health provider if stress feels unmanageable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Include Stress Management in Your Stroke Prevention Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Benesch encourages patients to take stress seriously—but not to let it overwhelm them. “You can’t control everything, but you can take control of small, daily decisions that support your health,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s going for a walk, getting enough sleep, or talking to someone about what’s on your mind, stress management is a vital part of caring for your heart, brain, and body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Are the Warning Signs of a Stroke?

Globally, more than 150 million people are projected to develop dementia by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, this growing burden will increasingly strain families, caregivers, and the healthcare system—especially in underserved communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from more than 25 million traditional Medicare beneficiaries between 2015 and 2021, focusing on trends in dementia incidence and prevalence across age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They made the following key findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age- and sex-adjusted incidence of dementia fell from 3.5% in 2015 to 2.8% in 2021.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the same time, prevalence rose from 10.5% to 11.8%, with nearly 2.9 million beneficiaries—about 12% of traditional Medicare enrollees—living with a dementia diagnosis by 2021.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dementia incidence was highest among Black beneficiaries (3.1%), followed by White (2.8%) and Hispanic (2.6%) beneficiaries in 2021.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher rates of dementia were consistently found in women, racial and ethnic minorities, and people living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was funded by the Duke-UNC Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) under award P30AG072958 from the National Institute on Aging.

The overall age and sex standardized incidence decreased between 2015 and 2021 from 3.5% to 2.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-7"&gt;Prevalence increased during this time from 10.5% to 11.8%. Male beneficiaries had a higher age standardized incidence than did female beneficiaries in 2015 (3.5% &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt; 3.4%), a difference that widened by 2021 (2.9% &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt; 2.6%; estimated difference-in-difference 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 0.95; P&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-7"&gt;Incidence was highest in 2015 for black beneficiaries (4.2%), followed by Hispanic beneficiaries (3.7%) and white beneficiaries (3.4%), and in 2021 for black beneficiaries (3.1%) followed by white beneficiaries (2.8%) and Hispanic beneficiaries (2.6%); the difference between white and black beneficiaries narrowed from 2015 to 2021 (difference-in-difference 0.92, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.93; P&amp;lt;0.001) as did the difference between white and Hispanic beneficiaries (difference-in-difference 0.88, 0.87 to 0.89; P&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-8"&gt;The incidence of dementia decreased from 2015 to 2021, but the prevalence increased.

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I don't like?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels.

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! Feel free to eat the same breakfast and lunch every day if it’s easier for your routine. We chose recipes that provide a good mix of fiber and protein, so opting to choose the same meal most days should be fine for most people. If you’re closely monitoring calories, protein, fiber or other nutrients, you may want to adjust a snack or two to fit your goals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What is the Mediterranean diet?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet is a way of eating that focuses on fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds, fish, healthy fats, whole grains and proteins while limiting ultra-processed foods, refined grains and added sugars. It emphasizes cooking more meals at home and enjoying meals with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_724-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s no secret that healthy aging is a priority for most people—and following the Mediterranean diet can help. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is continuously linked with improved health outcomes. Research links the Mediterranean diet with reduced inflammation and improved metabolic and cognitive function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition to its impressive &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8050356/brain-benefits-mediterranean-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;benefits for the brain&lt;/a&gt;, the Mediterranean diet is associated with reduced incidence of frailty in older adults, which helps support good physical function, balance and bone health.

Maybe some flowers or a teddy bear. It would have been a thoughtful gesture. After all, this was going to be our final farewell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was making a house call to see my favorite 93-year-old patient living in a seniors residence in Toronto. We had bonded over the last few years, and it felt more like a close-knit friendship than a professional relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We enjoyed joking around and talking about the beauty of life and all the wonderful places on our lovely planet, and the beautiful people. We also spent a lot of time talking about Nova Scotia, where we both used to live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a cherished dog or cat is old, sick and suffering, we “put them down.” The technical term is euthanasia, which comes from the Greek word “euthanatos,” literally meaning “a good death.” We euthanize our beloved pets because we don’t want them to suffer, and we want them to die with dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the Parliament of Canada passed federal legislation allowing eligible adults to request medical assistance in dying, essentially legalizing euthanasia for human beings to allow for “a good death.” It was decided that, like our precious animal friends, we should have the right to avoid suffering and die with dignity when there is no chance of reasonable alleviation of a disease or condition, or of sustaining one’s quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation effectively acknowledged that death is a part of life that should be discussed and even tenderly embraced at the appropriate time. It gives adults of sound mind the option to dismiss the notion of “raging against the dying of the light” as depicted in Dylan Thomas’ famous poem “Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. MacNeil was a proud and independent woman who wanted to remain in control of her body, her health and her life. It was her wish to exit this world on her own terms. She was intelligent and competent, and she understood her medical condition precisely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her health was deteriorating due to several debilitating and incurable diseases, including cancer. She knew her health would soon worsen dramatically. Sadly, she had been feeling especially unwell for over a year, and it became impossible to sufficiently lessen her suffering. So, she had had enough. Her health care providers, including myself as her primary physician, her friends and her relatives all supported her carefully measured decision to end her life with comfort and with dignity. After all, it was all about her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“She had no regrets whatsoever and was ready to disembark from her fantastic journey on this earth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. MacNeil told me she had lived a long and meaningful life. She traveled all around the world. She made many friends. She lived life to the fullest. Her husband had passed away years ago and they had no children, but there were nieces and nephews who loved her dearly. She had no regrets whatsoever and was ready to disembark from her fantastic journey on this earth. She clearly demonstrated that she had the capacity to make such a monumental decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous time I had seen her, she sat down and paused for a few seconds, and then looked at me earnestly and asked, “Will you be there to hold my hand?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could I refuse such a request?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt it would be a great honor and privilege, but I wondered if I would need someone to hold my hand as well. I was a little scared. I had never been present at such an occasion, partly because of scheduling issues, and partly because I worried about my own discomfort. Perhaps mainly because of cowardice. But Mrs. MacNeil was a special lady. Above all, I wanted to respect her wish and make her happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I entered the seniors residence and nervously walked into Mrs. MacNeil’s suite, I took a deep breath. There she was, standing in the middle of her living room, dressed impeccably and wearing some makeup. She was in her element. Seeing my terminally ill patient looking so majestic gave me goosebumps. As she noticed me enter, a warm smile spread across her face, and her eyes sparkled. I immediately realized my participation in this momentous event was most appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. MacNeil looked so happy — triumphant, even. We hugged, and she thanked me for being there. There were already others in the room, including family members and the doctor who would be performing the MAID procedure. I introduced myself to each of them and was relieved that everyone was both composed and compassionate. It certainly helped soothe my apprehension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. MacNeil cheerfully stated that she had a gift for me, and she gently handed me a souvenir from Nova Scotia. It was a seagull wearing rubber boots carved out of wood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve had this for many years!” she exclaimed. “I thought about it and decided you’re the one I’d like to give this to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The wooden duck that Mrs. MacNeil gave the author before her death.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Herag Hamboyan"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Herag Hamboyan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was deeply moved as I embraced the seagull and then gave her another hug. I felt another wave of guilt and shame for not bringing her a farewell gift. Despite feeling blindsided by her thoughtfulness, I accepted the gift with a lump in my throat and told her I would always keep it and always remember her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the MAID physician prepared the medications, I wondered how Mrs. MacNeil would feel in her final moments of life. She already had an intravenous line in place and I sensed that she was feeling nervous, excited and relieved all at the same time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Everyone gathered in her bedroom, and she lay down on her bed for the last time. There was a sense of calm. Were we prepared for what was about to transpire? I felt like a wide-eyed child full of wonder about to experience something completely new.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The MAID process was thoroughly explained again for the umpteenth and last time. Then Mrs MacNeil was asked one final question: “Are you certain you want to go through with this? There is no turning back.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Yes,” she responded clearly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She was prepared and content with her decision. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I sat down beside her and held her hand. I looked into her eyes, which were clear and focused. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I whispered into her ear, “I have a gift for you, but it’s not a physical gift. I think you will recognize this...”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I began singing “Farewell to Nova Scotia,” a well-known traditional song from our province.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The sun was setting in the west&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The birds were singing on every tree&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;All nature seemed inclined for rest&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But still there was no rest for me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So farewell to Nova Scotia, the seabound coast&lt;br&gt;Let your mountains dark and dreary be&lt;br&gt;For when I’m far away on the briny ocean tossed&lt;br&gt;Will you ever heave a sigh or a wish for me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A radiant smile slowly appeared on Mrs. MacNeil’s face, and she kept her eyes on me the entire time I was singing to her. I felt this was quite possibly the most befitting farewell gift I could have given her. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The medications were slowly introduced into her IV. She closed her eyes, and with that lovely smile still on her lips, she went gently into that good night. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The room was quiet as everyone processed the sublime event that had just taken place. I had to reach for a tissue to wipe the tears welling up in my eyes. Although it felt odd, it also felt right. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are many who feel it is wrong for health care professionals to “play God” — to decide who lives and who dies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But one could argue that such circumstances go beyond “wrong” and “right.” It’s about acknowledging the individual’s autonomy and &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; decision about what is appropriate for themselves. What is “right” or “wrong” depends on perspective, and when it comes to the health and body of a human being, the most important perspective is that of the person who is facing their own mortality. It is a sacred perspective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mrs. MacNeil was in tune with what was happening to her body and what was going to happen to it. She made an autonomous decision of sound mind. She knew what she wanted — and what she didn’t want. Furthermore, she was able to feel the enormous satisfaction of regaining control of her body, which was full of aggressive and unappeasable afflictions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It made me wonder about my own eventual exit from this world. Would I rage against the dying of the light? For how long? I would hope to be kept comfortable. If that were not possible, would I decide to take the reins of my departure from life into my own hands? I’m certainly more comfortable with that idea after watching Mrs. MacNeil die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a result of my first experience witnessing MAID, I received not only a wooden seagull from a special lady, but also another precious gift: a firsthand understanding of a good death. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mrs MacNeil had a dignified end to her long life, surrounded by loved ones. It was her decision. And it was a beautiful final farewell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Some names and details have been changed to protect the privacy of individuals mentioned in this essay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Herag Hamboyan grew up in Nova Scotia, Canada, and is the medical director of 20 senior homes in the greater Toronto area.

The treatment uses antisense technology to silence the FUS gene, reducing toxic protein buildup in motor neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two patients in a recent case series showed remarkable responses—one regained the ability to walk and breathe unassisted, while another has remained symptom-free for three years. The therapy also significantly reduced neurofilament light levels, a biomarker of nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Therapy:&lt;/strong&gt; The treatment uses antisense oligonucleotides to silence the FUS gene and reduce toxic proteins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected Recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Some patients showed functional improvement, a rare outcome in ALS research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biomarker Drop:&lt;/strong&gt; Treated patients had up to an 83% reduction in neurofilament light, indicating reduced nerve damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Columbia University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Columbia neurologist and scientist Neil Shneider speaks to his ALS patients who volunteer for experimental therapies, he’s unwaveringly honest. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients always ask me, “What can I hope to get out of this?” Shneider says. “And I always say, in most clinical trials, our hope is that we can slow the disease or maybe even halt progression.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it was a big surprise when some of the patients treated with an experimental drug—a therapy that emerged from Shneider’s research efforts—showed improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110378"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person walking and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results suggested that reducing levels of toxic FUS proteins could prevent or delay onset and progression of ALS. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When testing new drugs for ALS, we do not expect to see clinical improvement,” Shneider says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve seen in one patient is really unprecedented functional recovery. It’s surprising and deeply motivating for us, the ALS research community, but also the community of ALS patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remarkable success stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from 12 patients—all treated with the novel therapy for a rare form of ALS caused by a genetic mutation in a gene called &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt;—were presented in a case series published by Shneider online in &lt;em&gt;the Lancet. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though these gene mutations are responsible for only 1% to 2% of ALS cases, they cause some of the most aggressive forms of ALS that begin in adolescents and young adults. In patients with these mutations, toxic FUS proteins accumulate in the motor neurons that control the patient’s muscles, eventually killing the neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the patients in the published case series showed a remarkable response to the experimental therapy, ulefnersen (previously known as jacifusen), developed by Shneider in collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One young woman, who has received injections of the therapy since late 2020, recovered the ability to walk unaided and to breathe without the use of a ventilator, both previously lost to ALS. She has lived longer with this disease than any other known patient with this juvenile-onset form of FUS ALS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second patient, a man in his mid-30s, was asymptomatic when he began treatment, but tests of electrical activity in his muscles indicated that symptoms would likely emerge soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In three years of continuous treatment with the experimental drug, the man has yet to develop any symptoms of FUS-ALS and the abnormal electrical activity in his muscles has improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, after six months of treatment, patients in the series experienced up to 83% decrease in a protein called neurofilament light, a biomarker of nerve damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These responses show that if we intervene early enough and go after the right target at the right time in the course of disease, it’s possible to not only slow disease progression, but actually reverse some of the functional losses,” Shneider says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also a wonderful example of precision medicine and therapeutic development based on science and an understanding of the biology of disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though most of the other symptomatic patients in the series did not survive their aggressive disease, Shneider says “several apparently benefited from the treatment. The progression of their disease slowed, and they lived a longer life as a consequence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case series also showed that the drug is safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events related to the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seeing results from the first of these patients, Ionis Pharmaceuticals committed to sponsoring a global clinical trial of the drug, led by Shneider, which is now in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Now we are eagerly awaiting those results, which we hope will lead to the approval of ulefnersen,” Shneider said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The story behind ulefnersen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of ulefnersen began as an effort to help a single patient and has grown into a full-scale clinical trial that could help many patients with this aggressive form of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shneider first tested the therapy six years ago in a patient from Iowa, Jaci Hermstad, whose identical twin had died from the disease years earlier. Shneider worked with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to develop a drug, never tested in people, that might slow the progression of Jaci’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had good reason to believe the drug might work. Just a few years earlier, his research in mice revealed that the FUS mutations cause cells to make proteins that are toxic to motor neurons. The results suggested that reducing levels of toxic FUS proteins could prevent or delay onset and progression of ALS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shneider believed the drug might be a powerful way to reduce FUS proteins. The drug belongs to an emerging and highly promising class that uses short pieces of DNA, called antisense oligonucleotides, or ASOs, to silence specific genes and halt the production of the proteins they encode. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ulefnersen was designed to silence the FUS gene and reduce production of toxic and normal FUS proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because we also found that mature neurons tolerate a reduction of normal FUS protein, our studies provided the rationale for treating FUS-ALS patients with this drug,” Shneider says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Shneider requested permission from the FDA to administer ulefnersen to Jaci through its expanded access program, sometimes called “compassionate use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, at least 25 patients have been treated with ulefnersen (originally named jacifusen for Jaci Hermstad) around the world in expanded access programs, including the dozen patients described in the Lancet article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, ‘Antisense oligonucleotide jacifusen for &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt;-ALS: an investigator-initiated, multicentre, open-label case series,” was published online in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; on May 22, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All authors (from Columbia University except where noted): Neil A Shneider, Matthew B Harms, Vlad A Korobeynikov, Olivia M Rifai, Benjamin N Hoover, Elizabeth A Harrington, Sonia Aziz-Zaman, Jessica Singleton, Arish Jamil, Vikram R Madan, Ikjae Lee, Jinsy A Andrews, Richard M Smiley, Mahabub M Alam, Lauren E Black (Charles River Laboratories), Minwook Shin (Sookmyung Women’s University, Korea), Jonathan K Watts (University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School), David Walk (University of Minnesota Medical School), Daniel Newman (Henry Ford Hospital), Robert M Pascuzzi (Indiana University School of Medicine), Markus Weber (Kantonsspital St. Gallen, , Switzerland), Christopher Neuwirth (Kantonsspital), Sandrine Da Cruz (Leuven Brain InstituteBelgium), Armand Soriano (Ionis Pharmaceuticals), Roger Lane (Ionis), Scott Henry (Ionis), Joel Matthews (Ionis), Paymaan Jafar-Nejad (Ionis), Dan Norris (Ionis), Frank Rigo (Ionis), Robert H Brown (Ionis), Stephan Miller (Ionis), Rebecca Crean (Ionis), and C Frank Bennett (Ionis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by grants from the ALS Association (ALSA CU20-1073), Project ALS, and Ionis Pharmaceuticals and with support from the Tow Foundation and the Nancy D Perlman and Thomas D Klingenstein Innovation Fund for Neurodegenerative Disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The study was also funded in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01NS106236, TL1TR001875, R01NS111990, UL1TR001873), the American Academy of Neurology, the American Brain Foundation, and the CReATe Consortium, the Angel Fund for ALS Research, Cellucci Fund for ALS Research, Max Rosenfeld ALS Fund, the University of Minnesota, and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neil Shneider has received research funding from Ionis Pharmaceuticals in support of this investigator-initiated study.

Jacifusen is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt; pre-mRNA, previously shown to delay neurodegeneration in a mouse model and potentially slow functional decline in a first-in-human study. Here, we sought to further evaluate use of jacifusen as a treatment for &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt;-ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This expanded access programme was conducted through a series of single-patient investigational new drug applications at five sites (four hospitals in the USA and one in Switzerland). Participants carried a &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt; variant and had clinical evidence of motor neuron disease onset or electrophysiological abnormalities, if not a diagnosis of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were ineligible if chronically ventilated with tracheostomy. Enrolled sequentially, participants received serial intrathecal injections of jacifusen over 2·8–33·9 months. Based on multiple ascending doses of jacifusen (from 20 mg to 120 mg), successive protocols were modified as safety and other data were acquired, with the last participants enrolled receiving 120 mg doses monthly from the start of their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 and standard cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metrics. Concentration of neurofilament light chain (NfL) in CSF was used as a biomarker of axonal injury and neurodegeneration, and the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score was used as an overall measure of motor function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biochemical analysis and immunohistochemical staining were done on post-mortem CNS tissues to quantify FUS protein expression and assess the burden of FUS pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between June 11, 2019, and June 2, 2023, we recruited 12 participants (median age 26 years [range 16–45]; seven [58%] were female and five [42%] were male) into the expanded access programme. Transient elevations in cell counts or total protein concentration in CSF (six [50%] participants) were unrelated to treatment duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common adverse events were back pain (six [50%]), headache (four [33%]), nausea (three [25%]), and post-lumbar puncture headache (three [25%]). Two participant deaths were recorded during the programme, both thought to be unrelated to the investigational drug. The concentration of NfL in CSF was reduced by up to 82·8% after 6 months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most participants had continued functional decline (as measured by ALSFRS-R) after starting treatment with jacifusen, one showed unprecedented, objective functional recovery after 10 months, and another remained asymptomatic, with documented improvement in electromyographic abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis of CNS tissue samples from four participants showed reduced FUS protein levels and an apparent decrease in the burden of FUS pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest the safety and possible efficacy of jacifusen for treating &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt;-ALS.

crisis as the number of new babies born each year continued to decline as women are waiting later than ever to have children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of 2024, the total fertility rate is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14639873/america-baby-bust-fall-mothers-graphs-trump-pregnancy-boom.html"&gt;1.6 children per woman in the US &lt;/a&gt;or 1,626.5 births per 1,000 women - a sharp decline from 66.3 live births per 1,000 women in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parents-to-be are also having more trouble getting pregnant as experts say that an increasing number of people are looking at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ivf/index.html" id="mol-6f00e150-3816-11f0-a0f6-1718ee6ddbc4"&gt;IVF&lt;/a&gt; solutions and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/surrogacy/index.html" id="mol-8a35fa20-3814-11f0-8e68-cd64d119bf90"&gt;surrogacy&lt;/a&gt; to have children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Globally, approximately 17.5 percent of adults of all genders or roughly one in six people, experience infertility, according to the World Health Organization. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, about nine percent of men and about 11 percent of women of reproductive age in the US have experienced fertility problems. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from women deciding to have children later in life, experts also believe that worsening mental health, exposure to toxins in the environment and hormonal imbalances are also contributing to the declining birth rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, fertility experts have told DailyMail.com what women can do to improve their reproductive health, as the NIH projects 7million women are expected to experience infertility in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The National Institute of Health estimates that over seven million American women are expected to experience infertility this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Jessica Sharratt, an expert in Oriental Medicine and founder of Heal Los Angeles, an increase in chemicals in the environment, as well as worsening lifestyle habits may be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She told DailyMail.com&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; '&lt;span&gt;While there are so many factors contributing to rising infertility in women, the ones that feel most significant - and most overlooked - are toxic exposures and chronic nervous system dysregulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Jamie Stanhiser&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We’ve made huge strides in raising awareness about environmental toxins, but the impact on fertility is still wildly underestimated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We’re swimming in a sea of synthetic chemicals — pesticides on our food, plastics in our water, hormone-disrupting ingredients in our skincare and "clean" beauty products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These exposures don’t cause an immediate twinge, which is part of the problem. You don’t feel it when you swipe on deodorant or eat produce sprayed with glyphosate — but that doesn’t mean your body isn’t responding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These chemicals build up quietly over time, especially in fatty tissues and reproductive organs, and they interfere with the delicate hormonal symphony required for ovulation, implantation, and full-term pregnancy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2017 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found women who consume more than two servings of high-pesticide fruits or vegetables - which include strawberries, grapes and kale - each day were 18 percent less likely to become pregnant and 26 percent less likely to have a live birth than women with the lowest exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers asked 325 women undergoing infertility treatment as part of the Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) study to answer questions about their regular diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then compared the information with US government data on average pesticide residues on fresh fruits and vegetables in order to &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-13669201/cancer-study-chemicals-fruits-vegetables-dangerous-smoking.html"&gt;estimate the women’s diet-related exposure to pesticides&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Dr Jamie Stanhiser, a fertility expert at the Reproductive Partners Fertility Center in San Diego, believes reproductive conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), stress and anxiety may also be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the website: 'Health conditions such as obesity, PCOS, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases are increasing. All of these disorders are associated with an increased risk of infertility.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PCOS is a hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age and causes the ovaries to produce higher than normal levels of androgens, leading to hormonal imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can often lead to irregular periods and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Stanhiser added: 'People are experiencing increased stress without also increasing their healthy stress management techniques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Health disorders including anxiety and depression are increasing significantly in the United States and can increase the risk of infertility while also interfering with an individual or couple’s ability to seek fertility treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The relationship between mental health and fertility is bidirectional, meaning that infertility is very hard to experience and therefore can also increase the risk of anxiety and depression.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous studies have shown a link between mental issues such as depression, anxiety and severe stress and infertility in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/271326/1-s2.0-S0015028224X00023/1-s2.0-S0015028224000165/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjECAaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQDIFQqf5%2FYSRBgobPDepw7iBZXXNnW4m75gIniFFSa7OAIgfwrOdL03rypiYu0Ape6gpZQf9j1iNOGLDUPrGpsnOdcqvAUI2f%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARAFGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDFVAUI2HdVuiIWQv0CqQBYZ%2Fo2IFqWzZNd1XfAynH3kL4ICSCDgZe2NP7hiUW6ADkZjfVI92CoYSWsdaNQdTqobtkT4f%2F2oz68e0%2FQUXrEf8LQo%2FL%2FGXaWIXeputOOb7n6Z%2FzPmDL0GII%2F4hqsPV0TOvHv02id6IzBesjr%2BMsrAbB10j8jPj2O7wlgNZ2tvcF1ZlKDs7RB85cvObDTQutuQWckFXkRIklcLkcR6ZXpKC2RFYQ%2FofCNkKoYH6HhNCdGef4sqosvCc38y2n6xz6cviVpVi80FqEnelrY1ggchR%2BJZmTs4%2FKAw7xh7UF7Y6LFq5UDIneH52jUd2LDVMJSNAhSW%2FP9ZpyOXJD5t0YEaRKoKegSyBMcj7XnG4op%2FqucRiWFzUXBHp9XbMeDAE9Pu8FEzqxtYOTyvv7oB5k5ATDa9gpC%2FTyDJPOdblbF4zUcEvbb%2B65rOMQe7DpEnvg7vadl91cFSVU7EgteWuxhrv3MS9hZ%2B4zFxvuUeCVWKPyFk8u5LNzK8oZqgvgycjVf1P9lO35Ys7sY6l%2FEkkkfkh8CFo5w5oU2DNBqLRIWq4G5Hf2EhB35%2F3SmYiHstmuYRqzrgrFcqIHzL9PXoGU%2BmoFkfxyZrVRLyk7eP9dUdKlu68b"&gt;literature review&lt;/a&gt; that analyzed over 3,000 studies noted that out of 100 infertile and 100 fertile women in Pakistan, 29 percent with infertility had severe stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review also found there was a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety in women with infertility compared with fertile control groups in Hungary and Pakistan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Male infertility has also been on the rise as studies show it affects about 10 to 15 percent of American men who are trying to conceive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can be due to a variety of reasons including grief, depression, low sperm count, swollen veins in the testicles, genetic disorders and chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the US facing a fertility 'crisis,' doctors also revealed their recommendations to improve fertility in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Jamie Knopman, a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist and director of fertility preservation at CCRM Fertility of New York, following a Mediterranean diet - &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5327459/Mediterranean-diet-raises-IVF-success-rate-70.html"&gt;filled with fruits, grains, nuts and fish&lt;/a&gt; - as well as exercising regularly can make a big difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors have also revealed their best recommended ways to improve fertility in women &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'For food, I recommend a balanced, healthy diet - a plate that is colorful and has foods from all different groups. I don’t like fad diets and think they are not helpful for the body or one’s fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am a fan of the Mediterranean diet because it has been demonstrated to lower inflammation, and inflammation can contribute to infertility.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Mediterranean diet emphasizes plant-based foods and healthy fats &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11860147/Mediterranean-diet-rich-nuts-oils-leafy-veg-slashes-risk-early-death-women.html"&gt;including vegetables, fruit, beans, lentils, whole grains, fish, extra virgin olive oil and nuts&lt;/a&gt;. It can help maintain health, as well as keep the body well nourished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For exercise, I am a big fan of moving your body – movement really is medicine. That is why I never tell patients to stop exercising while going through fertility treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr. Jaime Knopman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I always tell patients you can strength train, ride the stationary bike, walk on a treadmill on an incline, and more while undergoing fertility treatments.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, Dr Elizabeth King, a certified fertility expert at her namesake clinic in Irvine, California, recommends eating an anti-inflammatory diet and learning how to regulate your nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'Eat an anti-inflammatory diet. Do a food sensitivity test to know what you need to avoid that may be causing inflammation, as well as following a traditional anti-inflammatory diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Organic fruits and vegetables combined with lean proteins and healthy fats can fight oxidative stress by providing essential nutrients and antioxidants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Learn to regulate your nervous system by figuring out a practice that works for you, like meditation, yoga, prayer, exercise, or dance, and make sure you are getting good sleep.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Additionally, about nine percent of of men and about 11 percent of women of reproductive age in the US have experienced fertility problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, for those looking to seek consults with fertility experts and opt for the fertility treatment in-vitro fertilization, Dr Iris Insogna of the Columbia University Fertility Center suggests: 'For heterosexual couples, if the female partner is under the age of 35, it is important to seek an evaluation with a fertility specialist if you have not conceived on your own within 12 months of trying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If the female partner is 35 or older, it is important to seek an evaluation with a fertility specialist if you have not conceived within six months of trying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For same sex couples, single parents by choice, or women over 40, it is reasonable to consult a fertility specialist at any time.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Knopman added: 'Throughout any fertility journey it’s important to be kind to yourself. A lot of people take these recommendations and think, "I am not getting pregnant because I had a glass of rosé or ate French fries." Not only is that attitude unhelpful, it’s also wrong.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 12:41:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPS0pwcWxKOWE2TDJyQ3dfMHhTNGNpRHhRWHo5eGVYc0QtUlY0b2U2VWpXWlhwUlV1eEV3cFQ3R24xREFPV1dPT0M2MjQ1S3N4cFlhbkFxdUNfaUxjQXNBdU10dVI0VVZxcVU5dldKUWJIZ0pTd0NZYmZOaUlEclRjeHpYZUctcWlVS3NRY0VkUVlZMUtvWm9STW1IRm9QQ2FmNWw0ZGtxY3lQaWlB0gGyAUFVX3lxTFBIcWFnZzRWSVU5eV9qOG4tQVFWWGJOY3Y4YkJGWjR0WXdOUWE5SkRvdkEtMlNld1B2ZFozZktTM0gxM3MzYS1nd2E1RkdYcGpOUzlsblBOYmd6OUVjY2hQUk1fUnktUlJNNVBHSUtvYnoxSlh1dDFUbUlEMkZCT3kzQlAyVlBvS3VpY1hDUjdZbFd6UTlSNXpOYWFSZWk1d2xWV0VicTZQT19KRXNOcjVDeFE</guid></item><item><title>在医生说我将终身残疾之后，我用简单的伎俩治愈了我的慢性疼痛……以下是你可以做到的-每日邮报 | I cured my chronic pain with simple trick after doctors said I'd be disabled for life... here's how you can to - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At just 19 years old, Nicole Sachs was told she would be wheelchair-bound by the time she was 40, unable to travel or have children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sachs had been suffering from debilitating lower back pain for years and was told by her doctor it was caused by spondylolisthesis, a spinal condition where a vertebra slips out of place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors insisted her pain was tied to the chronic spine condition, saying spinal fusion surgery was her best option, without guaranteeing it would put a stop to her pain for good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But before she went through with it, she discovered the practice of mind-body work and something clicked: her pain stemmed not from a physical malady but repressed trauma and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, 30 years later not only is she pain-free, she’s a globe-trotting mother of three, defying the limitations once imposed on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In her book, &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Mind Your Body&lt;/span&gt;, Sachs, a social worker, reveals how she bridged the gap between traditional Western medicine and a radical new &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14561821/chronic-pain-diet-Carla-Veith-Carter.html"&gt;understanding of chronic pain&lt;/a&gt;: Her mind needed healing, not her spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her journey challenges everything she thought she knew about pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sachs writes it all started with a life-altering realization: doctors don’t always have all the answers.

In fact, Sachs recommends deleting or discarding it, because the purpose isn’t to reflect but to release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Follow with a Meditation or Self-Compassion Practice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;After journaling, give yourself a few minutes to calm your nervous system — through deep breathing, a quick meditation, or some soothing music. This signals to your brain that it’s safe to feel and let go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mind-body medicine, pain isn't random — it's the nervous system’s way of distracting from repressed emotions like rage or heartbreak by converting them into physical symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fix, Sachs says, is to stop fighting one’s feelings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She herself dealt with deep loneliness, rage and injustices as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As an adult, this triggered physical pain and she learned through mind-body science that her back pain was a response to that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By confronting repressed emotions, patients can ‘switch off’ the body’s primal alarm system, stopping pain in its tracks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As part of her practice, she created JournalSpeak — a raw, unfiltered journaling practice to release buried emotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;JournalSpeak instructs people to choose a topic that is emotionally triggering to them and write about it for 20 minutes without worrying about spelling or grammar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When completed, the person can burn, discard or delete the writings as the purpose is to purge, not reflect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After writing, Sachs then instructs people to meditate or do grounding breathwork.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She wrote: ‘When the impolite, unthinkable truths are exhumed and safely felt, the nervous system no longer reacts by flying into protective mode and sending pain signals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have been wrestling with the idea that chronic pain is connected to emotional turmoil, and could even be a response to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2012 report in the journal&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1084208X13000608"&gt; Techniques in Regional Anesthesia and Pain Management&lt;/a&gt; concluded that chronic pain and emotional trauma are physiologically intertwined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found 35 percent of chronic pain patients meet the criteria of a PTSD diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both conditions trigger hyperarousal in the amygdala and flood the body with stress hormones like cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022, researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, posited in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763422000471"&gt;Neuroscience &amp;amp; Biobehavioral Reviews&lt;/a&gt; that repressed anger rewires the brain, activating the amygdala and flipping the ‘pain switch’ on to cause conditions like fibromyalgia and unexplained back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pent-up rage, they found, disrupts key brain regions, turning emotional stress into physical pain. Unprocessed trauma and anger keep that pain switch turned on and continuously weaken the prefrontal cortex, which regulates emotions, decision-making, and pain signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sachs maintains the brain can learn to recognize that difficult emotions pose no real danger, reducing unnecessary pain signals, and t&lt;/span&gt;echniques like JournalSpeak and mindfulness help recalibrate the nervous system, demonstrating that stress does not require a painful survival response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976251335578" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that well-being and cognitive health are closely linked in later life, with each influencing the other in a dynamic and reciprocal relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the global population ages, the burden of cognitive decline and dementia is expected to increase dramatically. Efforts to identify modifiable factors that can help maintain cognitive function into older age have become a top priority. One area of growing interest is the role of psychological well-being. While earlier research has shown links between well-being and cognition, most studies could not determine whether changes in well-being led to changes in cognition or the reverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study, led by &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gabriellepfund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gabrielle Pfund&lt;/a&gt; of Auburn University and colleagues from Rush University and Washington University in St. Louis, aimed to clarify these relationships by using advanced statistical techniques to track both well-being and cognitive function in the same individuals over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have been interested in the construct of sense of purpose since early in my graduate school experience,” said Pfund, an assistant professor of human development and family science. “As I continued throughout graduate school, I came across more and more research that highlighted the predictive power of purpose, particularly for healthy aging. Like many, I’ve personally experienced the pain of losing a loved one to dementia. With pharmacological interventions still nascent, establishing nonpharmacological opportunities to combat the development of dementia and slow cognitive decline is imperative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data from 1,702 adults over the age of 65 who participated in two large studies based in the Chicago area: the Memory and Aging Project and the Minority Aging Research Study. Participants were racially diverse, with about three-quarters identifying as White and nearly a quarter identifying as Black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant completed annual assessments of their cognitive abilities and self-reported levels of well-being for up to 10 years. Cognitive function was measured using a comprehensive battery of 19 tests covering memory, processing speed, verbal ability, and spatial reasoning. Well-being was assessed using several measures, including the Psychological Well-Being Scale (which reflects eudaimonic well-being, such as autonomy and personal growth), a separate measure of sense of purpose, and the Satisfaction With Life Scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study focuses on the reciprocal relationship between cognitive function with three domains of well-being: (1) sense of purpose (the extent to which one feels they have personally meaningful goals and activities), (2) eudaimonic well-being (one’s sense of autonomy, personal growth, purpose, and connection to others), and (3) life satisfaction (one’s sense of contentment with their life),” Pfund explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the long-term patterns between well-being and cognition, the researchers used bivariate latent growth curve models. These models showed that people who started out with higher levels of well-being also tended to have higher levels of cognitive function. More importantly, participants who experienced steeper declines in well-being also tended to show steeper cognitive declines. These findings held even after accounting for factors such as age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also applied a second type of statistical model, known as random-intercept cross-lagged panel models, which allowed them to examine how changes in one variable predicted changes in the other over time. These analyses revealed that changes in well-being predicted subsequent changes in cognition—and vice versa. In other words, having a better-than-usual year in terms of well-being was followed by a better-than-usual year in cognitive performance. Similarly, declines in cognition predicted future declines in well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that as cognition function declined, so did participants’ levels of well-being,” Pfund told PsyPost. “We also found that declines in well-being at one time point predicted times in cognitive function at the next (and vice versa). These patterns remained when accounting for age, sex, race, APoE genotype (i.e., gene for Alzheimer’s risk), education, depressive symptoms, and neuroticism. This means that intervention efforts focused on the development, maintenance, and promotion of well-being could be a promising pathway to support healthy cognitive aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that these effects were not equally strong across all forms of well-being. Eudaimonic well-being and sense of purpose had a stronger and more consistent relationship with cognitive health than life satisfaction did. People with a strong sense of purpose were more likely to maintain their cognitive abilities, and cognitive declines had a more pronounced impact on this form of well-being than on general life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of my main interests in the current work was to see whether these different elements of well-being were all associated with cognitive decline equally,” Pfund said. “I expected the findings to be stronger for sense of purpose than life satisfaction, and that ended up being the case. This means this finding was not a surprise for me, but sometimes psychologists outside of the well-being research field consider these different domains of well-being consider them fairly synonymous, so I think this finding will likely be a surprise to others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s large sample size, long follow-up period, and racially diverse cohort strengthen the reliability of the findings. The researchers also took steps to control for many factors that might influence the results. However, as with any observational study, the results cannot prove causality. It is still possible that other unmeasured factors influence both well-being and cognition, or that some of the observed links are due to shared lifestyle or health-related variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also note that their findings may not apply equally across all populations. For instance, participants were primarily drawn from an urban region with relatively high access to health care and community resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the current study was quite well-suited to the current question given the large number of assessments and racially diverse sample,” Pfund said. “However, one question I have growing interest in is whether these findings would extend to more rural populations, who are at higher risk for cognitive decline, its risk factors (e.g., diabetes), and protective factors (e.g., access to medical care). Understanding whether these associations are consistent, stronger, or weaker in higher risk populations with less access to other medical support provides context for the generalizability of these findings and future intervention efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My main goal is to understand daily processes and mechanisms that link these long-term relationships,” Pfund continued. “Why is sense of purpose associated with cognitive function? Is it because purposeful people have better social relationships, engage in more cognitive activities, are more physically active, or is there something unique about feeling purposeful? This approach is necessary for establishing what factors are most necessary to intervene upon in daily life to promote healthy cognitive aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976251335578" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Bidirectional Relationships Between Well-Being and Cognitive Function&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Gabrielle N.

    &lt;p&gt;However for those now concerned about the calorie and saturated fat content of their meat, its fairly easy to make beef healthier. One gram of fat is worth nine calories which means that diligently trimming just 50g off your cut of beef could save you up to 450 calories. Plus – leaner cuts of beef (such as sirloin) tend to be less fatty anyway, so they’re ideal for those concerned about calories or saturated fat content, but not great for those hoping to harvest some dripping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, there are ways beef fat can be considered healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Three ways beef dripping is good for you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. It doesn’t contain any artificial trans fats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is because artificial trans fats are created through processing”, explains Nichola Ludlam-Raine, a registered specialist dietitian and the author of &lt;em&gt;How Not To Eat Ultra-Processed – &lt;/em&gt;and beef fat, quite clearly, comes straight from its source.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“It’s quite similar to butter in this respect,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial trans fats pose significant health risks, with &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33945244/#full-view-affiliation-1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;one wide-ranging review&lt;/a&gt; finding they can cause a significant increase in LDL (“bad”) cholesterol with a corresponding decrease in HDL (“good”) cholesterol, which can increase heart disease risk. Therefore, the fact that beef dripping doesn’t contain these artificial fats is a big health plus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It contains some useful vitamins and minerals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beef dripping contains some fat-soluble vitamins, like vitamin E, which helps to maintain healthy skin and eyes and vitamin K, which supports blood clotting. However, the amount of these vitamins found in beef dripping are low and, as Ludlam-Raine points out, “if you’re getting a lot of these vitamins from saturated fats, then there’s probably something very wrong with your diet”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also contains choline and omega-3 – two essential nutrients which the body cannot make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;3. It has benefits for the skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, people have used beef dripping on their skin for its supposed healing power. More recently &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/gabby-logan-match-of-the-day-health-tips/"&gt;some celebrities have claimed that by smearing it on their skins it gives them a more youthful appearance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sharon Wong, consultant dermatologist and hair specialist, describes it as a thick occlusive product, similar to Vaseline which “acts as a sealant, preventing water loss from the skin and supporting the skin barrier”. People with dry scaly skin conditions may therefore find it useful as a moisturiser, she explains, with one &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11193910/"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine concluding that it may help skin conditions such as dermatitis, psoriasis, dry skin and wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as it is pure fat, Dr Wong advises those with oily skin and acne avoid it, as it may worsen conditions or cause breakouts. Indeed, the 2024 study also found that topical application of beef fat may increase fatty acid concentration in the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many believe dripping has anti-ageing powers as it contains fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A which &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6791161/"&gt;stimulates collagen production&lt;/a&gt; – a protein that gives skin its firmness and elasticity. However Dr Wong says “this has not been substantiated and beef dripping is unlikely to deliver the same results as a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/skin/everything-you-need-to-know-about-using-retinol/"&gt;retinol&lt;/a&gt;”, which has been specifically formulated for skincare purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Wong says those who use it should apply it once or twice daily, to patches of dry skin, and to choose products from reputable brands which “have clear information regarding the ingredients, sourcing of tallow, and shelf life”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How does beef dripping compare to other cooking oils?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it’s a saturated fat, both Prof Berry and Ludlam-Raine agree that beef dripping is not a healthy option for cooking. Sadly even organic beef dripping is unlikely to be much healthier than the standard variations. “It may have an improved omega-3 to omega-6 ratio but that’s likely to be really minimal, so there aren’t any major nutritional benefits,” Ludlam-Raine says. Prof Berry goes as far to say to the claim that beef dripping is healthier than seed oils is&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;based on “vast quantities of nonsense” and “misinformation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has the advantage of having a high smoke point, which means “it doesn’t go rancid or literally doesn’t smoke at high temperatures,” Ludlam-Raine explains. However, our experts agree that beef dripping should be enjoyed as an occasional treat. Whilst cooking oils that are higher in healthy fats and antioxidants are better for regular cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The healthiest alternatives to beef fat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Extra virgin olive oil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra virgin olive oil takes the top spot when it comes to the healthiest oils to cook with as almost three-quarters of its fat is monounsaturated, which has a range of health benefits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. Protects the heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monounsaturated fats are vital for lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This “bad” cholesterol raises the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke when concentrations in the blood are too high. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9623257/"&gt;A 2022 study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition &lt;/em&gt;found regular consumption of olive oil was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Supports gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Berry says extra virgin olive oil contains healthy bioactive plant compounds, like polyphenols, which support the gut microbiome. These act as a prebiotic and encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria while inhibiting harmful ones, providing a boost to the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;3. Boosts the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109721081481?via%3Dihub"&gt;A 2022 study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at Harvard University found that half a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil each day slashed the risk of dying from Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s by 29 per cent and dementia by 28 per cent. Scientists have linked healthy fats to improved cognition as the brain needs these fatty acids for neurotransmitter production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Rapeseed oil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapeseed oil may be better for those on a budget, Ludlam-Raine says, as it’s cheaper than extra virgin olive oil but is still a healthier choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really high in unsaturated fatty acids and has a good ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fats,” Ludlam-Raine says. These fatty acids are essential, meaning the body can’t make them so we must get them from our diet. Whilst omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory, omega-6 fats tend to promote inflammation which means maintaining a balanced ratio in the body is important for overall health and to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The expert verdict: is beef dripping good for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although dripping can add delicious flavour to food, it’s something you should enjoy just once in a while as it has no health benefits,” Prof Berry concludes. Ludlam-Raine agrees, and says that those who enjoy it should continue to eat it, but in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a big proponent of the 80-20 rule where 80 per cent of the time you eat wholefoods, then 20 per cent of the time you eat your soul foods ie ‘treats’”, Ludlam-Raine says. “If beef dripping is your treat, then that’s fine, but it shouldn’t be an everyday thing and you shouldn’t be convinced into thinking it’s the ‘elixir of life’. The bottom line is that I would never buy it or give it to my family.”&lt;/p&gt;

They also monitored levels of creatine in the patients’ blood at the start, four weeks, and eight weeks later, along with levels of creatine in their brains. They also tested the patients' cognition at the start of the study and after eight weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The researchers found that 19 of the 20 participants were more than 80 percent compliant with taking the creatine during the study. They also found that creatine levels went up in their blood after four and eight weeks, and that creatine in the brain increased by 11 percent. And here's the really interesting part: The researchers discovered that the patients had better improvements in cognitive tests, including sorting and reading, along with tests to measure attention and response, after eight weeks of creatine supplementation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The researchers concluded that the findings provide “preliminary evidence” for more research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“We decided to do this study because there were a couple of recent studies in mice suggesting that, in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s, creatine monohydrate supplementation may be beneficial,” says study co-author &lt;a href="https://www.kumc.edu/mtaylor3.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.kumc.edu/mtaylor3.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Matthew Taylor" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Matthew Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, RD, assistant professor and director of the KU Brain Nutrition Laboratory at University of Kansas Medical Center. “Prior to this study, no work had been done in humans with Alzheimer’s, so it was the right time to start looking at it as a potentially beneficial supplement for Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-might-creatine-supplements-help-people-with-alzheimers-disease" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Why might creatine supplements help people with Alzheimer’s disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The study didn’t look into this, but there are some theories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“The brain requires a lot of energy, but in Alzheimer’s, brain energy metabolism drastically declines,” Taylor explains. “Creatine is a very important substance for transporting energy produced by our mitochondria and increasing creatine levels may even encourage mitochondria to produce more energy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS, co-founder of &lt;a href="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SoHo Strength Lab" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;SoHo Strength Lab&lt;/a&gt;, co-signs that theory. Creatine helps to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), “and ATP is the brain’s primary energy source,” he says. Adding more creatine to the body could, in theory, help support cognition in people with Alzheimer's disease, Matheny adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Creatine may also have other roles, like decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress in the body, which could potentially help with symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, Taylor says. “Each of these roles could help with cognitive function in Alzheimer’s, but we still have so much to learn about the roles of this molecule in the brain,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="should-people-with-alzheimers-disease-take-creatine-supplements" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;Should people with Alzheimer’s disease take creatine supplements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;We’re not there yet. Again, this was a pilot study and it simply found that people who have Alzheimer’s disease may be able to regularly take creatine supplements and might have a boost in cognition as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But this doesn’t mean that people with Alzheimer’s disease should take creatine, says &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amit Sachdev," data-node-id="24.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. “I would not advise the use of creatine with the goal of improving cognition,” he says, noting that there’s not yet “well-established data to support this use.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clifford Segil," data-node-id="25.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, agrees.

While both treatments led to improvements in mood, only escitalopram was linked to a reduction in brain activity in response to emotional faces. Psilocybin, on the other hand, appeared to preserve or slightly enhance emotional responsiveness, especially to neutral expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms. In recent years, it has attracted growing attention as a potential treatment for depression, particularly for individuals who do not respond to standard antidepressants. Unlike traditional medications, which typically take several weeks to show results, psilocybin often leads to rapid and lasting improvements after just one or two sessions, especially when paired with psychological support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional antidepressants like escitalopram work by increasing levels of serotonin, a brain chemical involved in mood regulation. However, these drugs are often only moderately effective and may come with side effects such as emotional blunting and sexual dysfunction. Emotional blunting refers to a general reduction in emotional intensity or responsiveness and has been reported by nearly half of patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind this study wanted to find out whether these two treatments—psilocybin and escitalopram—have different effects on how the brain responds to emotional information, especially facial expressions, which are central to social and emotional communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is part of a long &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/psychedelic-research-centre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;program of research at Imperial College London&lt;/a&gt;, which I’ve been very lucky and honored to be a part of, which is investigating the effects of psychedelic therapy. The inspiration for this particular study was to compare psychedelic therapy with a standard depression treatment (escitalopram) and investigate the possible mechanisms behind both,” explained study author &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1qhqgiYAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Matt Wall&lt;/a&gt;, the director of translational MRI at &lt;a href="https://www.perceptive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Perceptive Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/matthew.wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;honorary senior lecturer&lt;/a&gt; at Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, the researchers conducted a randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing psilocybin-assisted therapy with a standard course of escitalopram. The study included 46 individuals with moderate to severe depression. Twenty-five participants received two high-dose psilocybin sessions spaced three weeks apart, along with daily placebo capsules. Twenty-one others received daily escitalopram, beginning with 10 milligrams per day for the first three weeks and increasing to 20 milligrams for the final three weeks, along with two placebo psilocybin sessions involving a nonpsychoactive 1-milligram dose. All participants received the same psychological support throughout the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before starting treatment and again six weeks later, participants underwent functional MRI scans while viewing emotional facial expressions—fearful, happy, and neutral. This allowed the researchers to observe how the brain’s response to emotional information changed over time and differed between the two treatment groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed clear differences between the groups. In the escitalopram group, brain activity in response to emotional faces decreased across a wide range of cortical regions after treatment. The amygdala, a brain structure involved in processing emotions like fear, also showed reduced responses to fearful faces in this group. These findings are consistent with earlier studies linking SSRIs to dampened emotional responses, which may help patients feel less overwhelmed by negative emotions but can also blunt positive feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, psilocybin did not lead to the same kind of neural dampening. In fact, responses to emotional faces were mostly unchanged or slightly increased, especially in response to neutral expressions. Activity in the amygdala showed minimal change following psilocybin treatment. The differences in brain responses between the two groups were significant and involved areas linked to attention, emotion, and social understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible reason for the absence of strong neural changes in the psilocybin group may be the timing of the post-treatment scans. “Some of our previous work actually showed an increase in emotional brain function after psychedelic therapy, which we didn’t see this time; we think this is probably due to the timings of the after-treatment scans in this study which was quite a long time after the psychedelic therapy sessions (three weeks),” Wall told PsyPost. “These effects we saw before may have worn off by then.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these neural differences, both treatments were effective in reducing depressive symptoms. Participants in the psilocybin group reported larger improvements in well-being, pleasure, and emotional intensity compared to those in the escitalopram group. Notably, those treated with escitalopram showed greater reductions in emotional intensity, consistent with emotional blunting. Sexual function scores also declined more in the escitalopram group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional analyses explored how changes in brain activity and emotional function were related to clinical outcomes. In the escitalopram group, reductions in brain responses to emotional stimuli were associated with improved mood—particularly among participants who also experienced emotional blunting. In contrast, in the psilocybin group, improvements in depression were more closely tied to increases in emotional intensity rather than changes in brain activation. This suggests that while SSRIs may work by dampening emotional reactivity, psilocybin may help people reconnect with their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate “that psychedelic therapy and escitalopram were both effective treatments for depression, but the mechanisms behind how they produce these clinical effects may be quite different,” Wall said. “Escitalopram seems to reduce brain responses to all emotions, and we think this may relate to a common side effect of standard antidepressants called emotional blunting where patients report that they feel emotionally flat or numb. On the other hand, psychedelic therapy was as good as (or perhaps even better) at treating depression symptoms, but without the change in emotional brain function. Psychedelic therapy may be a good antidepressant treatment for patients who find the emotional blunting side-effects of standard antidepressants problematic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are some caveats to consider. Although the study was randomized and blinded, the strong effects of psilocybin likely made it easy for participants to guess their treatment group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s still a pretty small study with roughly 20 subjects in each group, so bigger studies of this type would be useful,” Wall noted. “Also, there are the standard issues with psychedelic research where it’s very difficult to keep subjects blinded to which treatment they’re having; it’s usually very clear to the patient if they’re in the psychedelic treatment group!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research with larger samples and different timing may help clarify how psilocybin influences emotional brain function over time. Studies that include more diverse populations, varied imaging tasks, and direct measures of brain plasticity could also offer new clues about how this therapy works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long-term the aim is really to have psychedelic therapy available as a mainstream treatment in a range of possible psychiatric disorders, but unfortunately we’re still quite a long way from that goal, and there a huge number of scientific, legal, and political hurdles to get over on the way,” Wall said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.20230751" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Reduced Brain Responsiveness to Emotional Stimuli With Escitalopram But Not Psilocybin Therapy for Depression&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Matthew B.

&lt;p&gt;It’s normal for everyday life and tasks to feel more difficult as you get older. Simple things that you probably didn’t have to think about at one point, like getting up off the couch or carrying grocery bags, might now feel like a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t have to be the case—not if you have a strength training programme in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training is an effective way to future-proof your body, and keep your joints and muscles healthy as you age, offsetting the natural effects of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Martin is a personal trainer who recently shared a look at how she trains her parents, who are in their late 50s and 60s, to help them maintain their independence as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These exercises are great for those who are looking to build muscle, improve balance and improve mobility,” Martin tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin designed this workout with everyday life in mind. “These exercises will help you get up off the floor with ease, push things above your head without shoulder pain, get up and down out of your chair, pick things up off the ground without lower-back pain, and feel more stable on your feet day to day,” says Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2

Kneel to stand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;2 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 6 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This exercise will help you get off the floor with more ease,” says Martin. It targets the quads, hamstrings, glutes and core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-squat-on-balance-ball"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Squat on balance ball&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 10-12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can be done on a balance ball or the ground,” says Martin, although she recommends investing in a balance ball if you’re able to. “The balance ball is great because it will help strengthen your core and improve your balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Holding onto a resistance band will allow you to get lower in your squat,” says Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-hamstring-curl"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Hamstring curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 6-8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the best exercises to help alleviate lower-back pain and increase hip flexibility,” says Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-push-press"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Push press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 10-12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This exercise will allow you to feel more confident pressing things up over your head day to day,” says Martin. “A push and press is a powerful movement that will also help improve shoulder mobility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-standing-march"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Standing march&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 20-24 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This exercise helps build core strength and stability, and will also help improve balance and coordination, as well as improve flexibility in the hip flexors,” says Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-6-split-squat-with-twist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Split squat with twist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;2 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 8-10 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This move helps improve balance and proprioception [your sense of where your body is in space], which will help you feel more stable in everyday activities,” says Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can do this without weights at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-7-bent-over-row"&gt;&lt;span&gt;7. Bent-over row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 10-12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/benefits-of-unilateral-training" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/benefits-of-unilateral-training"&gt;Unilateral exercises&lt;/a&gt; [where you work one side of your body at a time] help improve muscle imbalances and improve core strength,” says Martin. “This unilateral row will help you more effectively throw, pull or push things in real life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this version of the move, you rest one hand on an exercise ball while doing the row, which adds another benefit. “Pressing the opposite hand into the workout ball will help strengthen your pelvic floor,” says Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-8-bird-dog"&gt;&lt;span&gt;8. Bird dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;1 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 12-16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the best exercises to improve balance and mobility, and alleviate or prevent back pain,” says Martin.&lt;/p&gt;

Digestive issues often disrupt daily life, from uncomfortable bloating to stubborn constipation. Scheduling a doctor’s appointment for small ailments isn’t often possible.In such cases, one turns to home remedies that are effective. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a California-based gastroenterologist trained at Harvard and Stanford, with a million Instagram followers, has shared some home remedies one can try to eliminate common digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Yogurt for gut health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider yogurt as the bestie of gut health. Packed with probiotics, yogurt introduces beneficial bacteria that balance the gut microbiome. Yogurt aids digestion and boosts immunity. Yogurt is good for overall gut health. Choose plain, unsweetened yogurt with live cultures for maximum benefits. Regular consumption of yogurt can enhance gut flora, reduce inflammation, and improve overall digestive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Kiwi to relieve constipation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those struggling with constipation, Dr. Sethi suggests kiwi. This small, nutrient-dense fruit is rich in fiber and contains actinidin, an enzyme that promotes bowel regularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwi can get things flowing! Eating one or two kiwis daily can help alleviate constipation. Kiwi can increase stool frequency and improve consistency without the side effects of laxatives. Its high vitamin C content also supports overall digestive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people struggle with bloating. But a simple remedy can help relieve the uncomfortable gut issue. Ginger! Bloating can be uncomfortable and disruptive, and Dr. Sethi says ginger is a natural solution. Known for its anti-inflammatory and carminative properties, ginger helps relax the digestive tract and reduce gas buildup. One can consume ginger in a tea, grated into meals, or taken as a supplement. Ginger can soothe the stomach and improve digestion.Incorporating small amounts of ginger in your daily diet is good for your gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Bananas to combat diarrhea and acid reflux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas are great for digestive health. Dr. Sethi recommends bananas to stop diarrhea. Bananas have pectin, a soluble fiber that absorbs excess water in the intestines and firms up stools. They’re gentle and easy to digest, making them ideal when the digestive system is upset. Bananas can also help with acid reflux, as they act as a natural antacid, coating the stomach lining and neutralizing acid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat gut inflammation, Dr. Sethi recommends turmeric, a spice celebrated for its active compound, curcumin. Turmeric is a powerful anti-inflammatory that can calm an irritated gut. Curcumin has been shown to reduce symptoms of inflammatory bowel conditions and support gut healing. Consider adding turmeric to meals or taking it as a supplement with black pepper to enhance absorption. Beyond the gut, turmeric is also beneficial for overall immune health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Easy and effective home remedies for constipation relief&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Papaya to boost digestive enzymes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papaya is like a natural digestive aid. People who require digestive enzyme support, papaya is Dr. Sethi’s top pick. Rich in papain, an enzyme that aids protein digestion, papaya helps break down food and reduce digestive strain. Regular consumption of papaya can ease symptoms of indigestion and improve nutrient absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>生甜菜与水煮甜菜根：哪种形式能保证更多营养-印度时报 | Raw vs Boiled Beetroot: Which form guarantees more nutrition - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxNUzYzRnA5LUlMb29vVGJXQ0paU0s5b1ZZZ2lRaWtpZWxmWXdtMndCdzJnZ184UHF1QlZjeE1lbWVlcy1ZWU92a19wU19wOTNveHFDeERNQklrekphM05SZjMyVEU0blE2LWxNRS1RcDM0eTVCWVRRWVRSNUFQd2UtMHRqMG5zX0o5U2FqYXh3cFRsd0pWdmw2XzdGazIySk1vcXd1dHlwbWRzLWQ4N3lNWEwwU0p0WHBjS0hLemVtQ2pQYzYxS0poU0JGSWVfMEtQRmxKclpOd1A?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From boosting immunity to improving blood flow and pressure, beetroot is said to possess many health benefits. It is often referred to as a vibrant, nutrient-dense root vegetable known for its deep red color and impressive health benefits. Rich in folate, iron, potassium, and vitamin C, it supports blood health, boosts immunity, and enhances energy levels. A study published in 2021 by the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34222085/"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; investigated the effects of daily consumption of raw red beetroot on metabolic markers and cognitive function in individuals with type 2 diabetes. And it was found that regular consumption of raw beetroot for  8 weeks helped in reduction of fasting blood sugar levels, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), apolipoprotein B100, liver enzymes (AST and ALT), homocysteine levels, and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Additionally, there was a notable increase in total antioxidant capacity and improvements in cognitive function tests. It also suggested that consumption of raw beetroot can help in managing type 2 diabetes. However, there is a section of experts who feel that boiled beetroot is healthy too. So, let us find out which form guarantees more nutrition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 03:26:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2AFBVV95cUxNUzYzRnA5LUlMb29vVGJXQ0paU0s5b1ZZZ2lRaWtpZWxmWXdtMndCdzJnZ184UHF1QlZjeE1lbWVlcy1ZWU92a19wU19wOTNveHFDeERNQklrekphM05SZjMyVEU0blE2LWxNRS1RcDM0eTVCWVRRWVRSNUFQd2UtMHRqMG5zX0o5U2FqYXh3cFRsd0pWdmw2XzdGazIySk1vcXd1dHlwbWRzLWQ4N3lNWEwwU0p0WHBjS0hLemVtQ2pQYzYxS0poU0JGSWVfMEtQRmxKclpOd1A</guid></item><item><title>这5种工作习惯很常见，但它们可能是抑郁症的微妙迹象- BuzzFeed | These 5 Work Habits Are Pretty Common, But They Could Be Subtle Signs Of Depression - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOa3pHNTlNWGZCV1lQUXZfOHVkNHBEa0NsVWdmYjFjVFZsWUhPR3p0aVNmRlcxaUpqd2h6dXF5OGhNZjRnVHhJOGk1b3VVZU9iQ19iVzlxcU0wY2ZiX2h3SkNNa1phV0VHNlBLZVpWNWcwbXV5R2FIR1p4VVIwVnJHbDNJazh4WHJCYWtJWVlTUVJnMDRxMU5xZmpB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;There’s a difference between a one-time boring assignment and a worrisome pattern of apathy. Notice changes about how you feel regarding work that you used to take satisfaction in doing, Garcia said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You might notice yourself just staring at your screen, pretending to be busy, or doing anything but tackling the big stuff,” Garcia said. “That loss of interest that depression can cause may have you thinking ‘I just don’t care’ about your work.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do next if you suspect you have depression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these signs are resonating with your experience at work, know that you do not have to deal with depression on your own. There are steps you can take immediately to address how you are feeling and get better: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to what your body is telling you about your health. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your depression shows up as you hyper-functioning at work, it helps to check in with your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can be easy to miss depressive symptoms when work is tricking you into feeling competent and self-efficacious,” Velez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why Velez suggests asking yourself questions that can help you notice changes in your physical health like: Are you feeling more tired than usual? What’s your relationship with alcohol or marijuana? Are you getting too little or too much sleep? How is your relationship with exercise and movement? Are there points of nagging tension anywhere in your body? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physical signs and signals can alert you that it may be time to acknowledge those uncomfortable feelings,” Velez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to loved ones and trusted peers about how you’re feeling. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are depressed, you might not want anyone to know and may feel unworthy of your friends’ support. But in fact, talking to a few trusted peers and loved ones can be just what you need to help you against withdrawing and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best way to start managing depression is to talk with someone about it,” Howes said. He said you could open up to a friend or loved one, and let them know what you’re experiencing and how it’s impacting you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velez said it can also help for employees experiencing depression to ask trusted colleagues to stop by their desk for a quick coffee chat a couple times a week or to check in with them via text. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek professional help. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Know that depression is very common and often responds well to treatment,” Howes said. “If it seems like this is depression, talking with a physician or a mental health professional is crucial. They will be able to assess your symptoms and recommend a course of treatment that may include therapy, medication or both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With written documentation of your depression by a medical professional, you may also qualify for reasonable accommodations at your job under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. Examples of these accommodations can include permission to work from home or an altered schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/depression-boss-work_l_64a5846ae4b0dcb22c48cb1a" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795"&gt;you choose to share your condition with HR or your manager&lt;/a&gt;, they may be able to help you get company-sponsored resources and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many workplaces offer EAPs [Employee Assistance Programs] which have counselors on staff to provide short-term therapy or can also give the employee referrals for other services that may be needed such as child care, food and housing assistance, and therapists in the community,” Velez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess whether your job is making your depression worse. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing psychiatrist Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9667129/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Aaron T. Beck&lt;/a&gt;’s research on cognitive behavioral therapy, Velez said it is also important to learn if your job is providing you with the ability to feel pleasure, or a sense of enjoyment, and mastery, or a sense of achievement, because those are factors people need in order to combat depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To monitor if your job is exacerbating symptoms or is the source of them, Velez said an employee can keep track of work activities for one or two weeks in a spreadsheet, with one column for “pleasure” and another column for “mastery.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having visual evidence can be a great way to confirm or deny our feelings,” Velez said. “Taking an inventory can let you know if you are getting pleasure and mastery from your job or if it’s time to start looking for a new job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand that tiny wins do make a difference. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression often pushes you to isolate, do nothing, and be unkind to yourself. Doing the opposite, even in tiny ways, can really help,” Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Garcia said that if you’re struggling to get out of bed and are showing up late to work, you can try sitting up when you wake instead of staying horizontal. And if projects feel overwhelming, Garcia recommended breaking them down into smaller steps or committing to just five minutes of focused effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it helps to understand that you are more than your depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“See depression as something separate from who you are and practice resisting its urges,” Garcia recommended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is to remember that depression can be a tough mental health condition that affects &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7224a1.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;millions of people every day&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a manageable one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/depression-job-signs_l_65dcc2cde4b005b858310eac" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nami.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Alliance on Mental Illness&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helpline is 1-888-950-6264 (NAMI) and provides information and referral services; &lt;a href="http://www.goodtherapy.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GoodTherapy.org&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an association of mental health professionals from more than 25 countries who support efforts to reduce harm in therapy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

See if these work behaviors resonate:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You are working harder than ever to avoid going home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Tempura / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Depression can look different from person to person. Some co-workers may never guess that you are coping with depression because you are still functioning as a hardworking, reliable employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“For successful working professionals who have made a career out of achievement and getting validation from work, depression might look more active,” said &lt;a href="https://www.aliciaveleztherapy.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alicia Velez;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Alicia Velez&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed clinical social worker based in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She gave the example of an employee going through a divorce or taking care of a sick family member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You might have someone working more hours than usual, maybe raising their hand to go on that long business trip, or wanting to be the one to tackle challenging cases or problems,” Velez said. “Validation and recognition at work tend to feel better than having to confront that a marriage may be over or that a family member may be at the end of his/her life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. You were once a social butterfly but now you avoid co-workers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; VioletaStoimenova / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;How you interact with co-workers at work can help you understand if you are dealing with just a bad day or something deeper. Withdrawing from colleagues and isolating yourself are two common signs of depression, Velez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This may look like someone who used to actively participate in meetings is [now] quieter, sits in the back of the room, or even misses the meeting altogether,” she said. “Perhaps the employee no longer takes part in off-sites or after work happy hours. He or she might find ways to evade interactions with colleagues or managers. The worker may let their calls go to voicemail, or be slow to respond to emails or even not respond at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In extreme examples, a person who is exhibiting these behaviors can get in trouble at work and be at risk of losing their job, which can also result in a cycle of shame and guilt, Velez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. You are continuously missing deadlines and meetings. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; PeopleImages / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If handing in work on time or even showing up to work is becoming a daily struggle, it could also be a symptom of depression, Howes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I knew someone who enjoyed his work, was actively engaged in his projects, and had a lot of contact with his coworkers. When he became depressed, he started sleeping through his alarm and showed up late to work. He was falling behind on deadlines, stopped going to lunch with colleagues, and became highly critical of his [own] and his co-workers’ performance,” Howes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“All of these changes were noticed by colleagues and bosses, who reached out to him and encouraged him to seek help,” Howes continued. “Fortunately, he did, and through a combination of changing diet and sleep hygiene, beginning therapy, and receiving a prescription for an antidepressant, he was feeling better within a few months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. You are having angry outbursts at work.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Skynesher / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Depression isn’t just feeling down in the dumps ― it can make you super irritable too,” Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If every little annoyance is setting you off at work, it could be a signal to look deeper at the cause. People with depression deal with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3959025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptoms of overt or suppressed anger;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;symptoms of overt or suppressed anger&lt;/a&gt;, and can make their colleagues the target of their ire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“At work, you may find yourself easily annoyed by everyone and everything. Your fuse is short with your co-workers, customers, and even your inbox,” Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. You lose motivation or interest in the work you used to enjoy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Vm / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s a difference between a one-time boring assignment and a worrisome pattern of apathy. Notice changes about how you feel regarding work that you used to take satisfaction in doing, Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You might notice yourself just staring at your screen, pretending to be busy, or doing anything but tackling the big stuff,” Garcia said. “That loss of interest that depression can cause may have you thinking ‘I just don’t care’ about your work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do next if you suspect you have depression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If these signs are resonating with your experience at work, know that you do not have to deal with depression on your own.

Are there points of nagging tension anywhere in your body?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Physical signs and signals can alert you that it may be time to acknowledge those uncomfortable feelings,” Velez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to loved ones and trusted peers about how you’re feeling. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When you are depressed, you might not want anyone to know and may feel unworthy of your friends’ support. But in fact, talking to a few trusted peers and loved ones can be just what you need to help you against withdrawing and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The best way to start managing depression is to talk with someone about it,” Howes said. He said you could open up to a friend or loved one, and let them know what you’re experiencing and how it’s impacting you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Velez said it can also help for employees experiencing depression to ask trusted colleagues to stop by their desk for a quick coffee chat a couple times a week or to check in with them via text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek professional help. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Know that depression is very common and often responds well to treatment,” Howes said. “If it seems like this is depression, talking with a physician or a mental health professional is crucial. They will be able to assess your symptoms and recommend a course of treatment that may include therapy, medication or both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With written documentation of your depression by a medical professional, you may also qualify for reasonable accommodations at your job under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. Examples of these accommodations can include permission to work from home or an altered schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/depression-boss-work_l_64a5846ae4b0dcb22c48cb1a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:you choose to share your condition with HR or your manager;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;you choose to share your condition with HR or your manager&lt;/a&gt;, they may be able to help you get company-sponsored resources and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Many workplaces offer EAPs [Employee Assistance Programs] which have counselors on staff to provide short-term therapy or can also give the employee referrals for other services that may be needed such as child care, food and housing assistance, and therapists in the community,” Velez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess whether your job is making your depression worse. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Citing psychiatrist Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9667129/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Aaron T. Beck;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Aaron T. Beck&lt;/a&gt;’s research on cognitive behavioral therapy, Velez said it is also important to learn if your job is providing you with the ability to feel pleasure, or a sense of enjoyment, and mastery, or a sense of achievement, because those are factors people need in order to combat depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To monitor if your job is exacerbating symptoms or is the source of them, Velez said an employee can keep track of work activities for one or two weeks in a spreadsheet, with one column for “pleasure” and another column for “mastery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Having visual evidence can be a great way to confirm or deny our feelings,” Velez said. “Taking an inventory can let you know if you are getting pleasure and mastery from your job or if it’s time to start looking for a new job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand that tiny wins do make a difference. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Depression often pushes you to isolate, do nothing, and be unkind to yourself. Doing the opposite, even in tiny ways, can really help,” Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For instance, Garcia said that if you’re struggling to get out of bed and are showing up late to work, you can try sitting up when you wake instead of staying horizontal. And if projects feel overwhelming, Garcia recommended breaking them down into smaller steps or committing to just five minutes of focused effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultimately, it helps to understand that you are more than your depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“See depression as something separate from who you are and practice resisting its urges,” Garcia recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The point is to remember that depression can be a tough mental health condition that affects &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7224a1.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:millions of people every day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;millions of people every day&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a manageable one. &lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/depression-job-signs_l_65dcc2cde4b005b858310eac" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nami.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Alliance on Mental Illness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Alliance on Mental Illness&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helpline is 1-888-950-6264 (NAMI) and provides information and referral services; &lt;a href="http://www.goodtherapy.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoodTherapy.org;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;GoodTherapy.org&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an association of mental health professionals from more than 25 countries who support efforts to reduce harm in therapy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 00:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPSGlPMUloX0ZnRWhpNTJ3cmJ4MEttQnZpQmFlRXFFZ3lSOVRBdnNIWmNKQmJhR2lDY0t5cG5XUE05dFV1UGpSTjlGVzZUajdscGVBai0wRWk0cXhwNWxOQmN0Q3gyOERxbkRGMm5qR0ZBSUFlSkF2Z3lEMU5BenpLZw</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，随着年龄的增长，大脑健康的头号营养素- EatingWell | The #1 Nutrient for Brain Health as You Age, According to a Dietitian - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxQdGtqeW1wRjRwVVNkUk9haW5KMXRoNGFBcy1DclhRVE5uektla1RlNkczY0FhYnNMaVpBZ3oxOVc4YmVCcFc5YUdyRGhGNzR0cGlsVkpWbkdUekU5elNXR2R2eEFXamxuTVZYRWZOTzlXVUR3N2VEenI0MU5yWkJOQWZ3Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Are you looking for ways to stay sharp as you get older? Maybe you've watched a loved one struggle with cognitive decline and want to avoid that. Or perhaps you simply want to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944120/best-exercises-for-brain-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;be proactive&lt;/a&gt; for your brain health. No matter what the reason, we see you. And one of the best ways to do so is by incorporating more omega-3 fatty acids into your diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here's everything you need to know about omega-3s and brain health as you age.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;polyunsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; found in three main forms: Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). You need to consume these fats in your diet, as your body cannot make them in sufficient quantities on its own. Thankfully, seafood sources like salmon, fish oil and krill oil contain the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, while &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291962/8-best-vegan-omega-3-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant-based sources&lt;/a&gt; like walnuts, flaxseed and chia seeds contain ALA.
&lt;/p&gt;

From promoting heart health to reducing inflammation, improving mental health, cognition and more, the benefits of these necessary fats are far-reaching.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to one study, two in three Americans will experience some level of cognitive decline by the age of 70.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Given the benefits omega-3s have shown so far regarding cognitive health, researchers are beginning to dive further into the effects this fat has on the aging brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before we dive into the science, here's a biology refresher. The omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA are critical components of cell membranes—meaning they play an important role in keeping the brain functioning and facilitating communication between cells. Simply put, they are a big deal when it comes to cognitive health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to &lt;a href="https://facultyprofiles.tufts.edu/taylor-wallace" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Taylor Wallace, Ph.D., CFS, FACN,&lt;/a&gt; your body can produce around 10% of the amount of EPA and DHA you need from ALA that's consumed in your diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In other words, your body can convert ALA to EPA and DHA. However, as we age and with the onset of cognitive decline, this conversion rate starts to decline to less than 10%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "In both animal and human studies, when the diet is void of omega-3 fatty acids, the levels of DHA, in particular, in the brain decrease, accelerating aging and affecting memory," says Wallace.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But don't let this scare you, says &lt;a href="https://nomadistanutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mascha Davis, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. By incorporating omega-3s into your diet—yes, even starting today—you can begin to reap the benefits well into your future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Omega-3s act as a powerful anti-inflammatory agent. When we experience chronic inflammation in the body, cognitive health may decline, and age-related chronic disease conditions may increase. Adequate daily intakes of omega-3s have been shown to help to reduce inflammation in the body and thus protect against some age- and inflammatory-related conditions," says Davis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After evaluating the available data focusing on the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on diet-related disorders, one report concluded that EPA and DHA supplementation has a beneficial impact on inflammatory markers, oxidative stress and brain health outcomes, among other positive effects.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Another review had similar results, finding a link between omega-3 supplement intake and improvements in learning, memory, overall cognitive health and blood flow to the brain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In terms of disease prevention, one study found that higher blood DHA levels were associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's and all-cause dementia. Genetic factors also seemed to influence the benefits of DHA supplementation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans advise consuming fatty fish, like salmon, at least twice a week. However, given that 90% of Americans don't come close to meeting their recommended intakes every week, it's important to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consider a fish oil supplement&lt;/a&gt; to help fill in the gaps.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Those following a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026238/plant-based-vs-vegan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vegetarian or vegan diet&lt;/a&gt; can get EPA and DHA from algal oil supplements, which are derived from marine microalgae—the food source that fish use to store up EPA and DHA omega-3s in themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's worth noting, though, that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;most supplements are underregulated&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to choose one that has independent verification to ensure label accuracy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both Wallace and Davis recommend a food-first approach for getting omega-3s but will recommend supplements when dietary intake is lacking as a practical way for people to meet their daily needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adequate intake recommendations for omega-3s haven't been updated in over 20 years. Keeping that in mind, the current guidelines recommend omega-3 intakes of 1.6 grams per day for men and 1.1 grams per day for women—but these numbers are reflective of ALA recommendations only. There are currently no U.S. government dietary recommendations for EPA and DHA.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that said, the American Heart Association recommends at least 250 mg per day of DHA and EPA to prevent heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, are critical for healthy aging and cognition. While more research is needed on the recommended amounts for optimum brain health benefits, no matter how old you are, you should consider upping your intake of DHA and EPA omega-3 fatty acids. It's never too late—or too early—to start!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can increase your intake by eating fatty fish such as salmon, sardines and herring at least twice a week and incorporating plant-based sources like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-8628392" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, walnuts and flaxseeds on a daily basis.

&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;According to health news website &lt;em&gt;Healthshots&lt;/em&gt;, fatty liver disease occurs when excess fat accumulates in the liver, hindering its ability to function properly. A small amount of fat in the liver is normal, but when fat content exceeds 5% of the liver’s weight, it can lead to conditions such as cirrhosis, non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Those who are overweight or obese are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Fortunately, fatty liver disease is a reversible condition. Adopting a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, can help manage and reduce the condition. Below are five fruits that may aid in combating fatty liver disease:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Grapefruit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/5-fruits-that-support-liver-detoxification-4888511.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;grapefruit&lt;/a&gt; may help repair liver damage caused by fatty liver disease and assist in detoxifying the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Additionally, rich in antioxidants like naringin and naringenin, grapefruit helps reduce inflammation and protect the liver, benefiting overall liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/red-green-or-yellow-which-apple-color-is-best-for-you-4880449.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;Apples&lt;/a&gt; are high in soluble fiber, which aids in reducing liver fat and facilitates detoxification. The polyphenols found in apples also help reduce fat accumulation in the liver, promoting better liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tplCaption" data-widget="obj"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img alt="Red and green apples.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Avocado&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/is-freezing-avocados-a-good-way-to-preserve-them-4863703.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;Avocados&lt;/a&gt; are rich in healthy fats and contain phenols, which may help lower blood lipids and prevent liver damage, particularly in those with NAFLD. A 2015 study published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine reported that avocados might help lower the risk of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Papaya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Papayas are packed with enzymes and vitamins that aid digestion and reduce the liver’s workload. By improving digestion, papaya allows the liver to function more efficiently and may help alleviate NAFLD, according to studies conducted on rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Kiwi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Kiwi is nutrient-dense and supports liver health with its powerful antioxidants. These antioxidants help prevent fatty liver diseases and protect the liver from damage, boosting overall liver function and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="true" data-component-type="tin_xemthem" data-component-value="4888511,4888603,4887058,4889628,4889637,4890060" data-thumb="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A PROCLAMATION&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-left"&gt;During National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, we celebrate the foundational role that physical fitness and sports play in helping us to live longer, healthier, and more fulfilling lives.  Through sports, fitness routines, and staying active, we have the opportunity to improve our health, strengthen our communities, and build a brighter future for our country. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For far too long, our Nation has failed to prioritize the health and well-being of the American people.  This negligence has come at a devastating cost.  As a result, the United States lags behind other developed countries in life expectancy, chronic disease prevention, and overall public health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This era of indifference ended when I took office.  I was proud to appoint Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as the Secretary of Health and Human Services to urgently confront and stop this crisis.  I also established the Make America Healthy Again Commission, tasked with ensuring Americans have access to nutritious food choices, while addressing the root causes of childhood chronic diseases.  With public health as a cornerstone of my Administration, we are forging a future where the American people are healthier and stronger than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Engagement and active participation in sports, especially among our youth, is vital to fostering a culture of health and physical fitness.  My Administration is committed to ensuring that our sports and competitive spaces remain safe, free, and accessible for future generations of Americans.  In my first term, I signed an Executive Order to nationally expand children’s participation in sports, promoting physical activity, fitness, and the academic and social benefits of healthy lifestyles.  I was also proud to recently sign an Executive Order to keep biological men out of women’s sports, ensuring our female athletes are free to compete and excel on a level and fair playing field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, we are building a healthier and more flourishing Nation, one that champions physical fitness and well-being, empowering every citizen to reach their full potential and excel in all aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2025 as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month.  I call upon the people of the United States to incorporate physical fitness and sports participation into their everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;DONALD J. TRUMP&lt;/p&gt;

I was sideswiped by a car, then ran over by the truck behind while cycling to work. I was essentially impaled by my right femur, which shattered my pelvis and shoved bone fragments into my guts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last thing I remember before I got knocked out for surgery, was the surgeon telling me everything was going to be fine, and it was all routine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I didn't wake up for a month. When I did, I was missing the entire left leg, and most of the muscle tissue in the right. I was too weak to move much, couldn't talk because I had a tube through my neck, and I was very uncertain about reality due to what I went through in my coma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Parades of doctors came to tell me how I should be dead, and it's crazy that I lived. I was told over and over that my survival was very much against all odds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; My surgeon on the other hand, never said anything like that. He always maintained that he was going to get me through. His attitude honestly helped when I had to go back to his table a few more times before I was done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For 4 years, I kind of blew off the people who made a big deal about my survival. I adopted my orthopedic doctors attitude. Then I met a woman who's in the medical field. I fell in love, and eventually trusted her enough to let her read my medical records. I had never read them, because it's a massive pile of paperwork.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; She broke down crying and couldn't read anymore. She told me that the beginning of my time in the hospital was full of the type of write-ups you find in the morgue. She told me that when they opened me up, bits of my pelvis fell out. I asked her to stop there. She won't read anymore, and I don't want to know anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I now know my doctor has one hell of a pokerface.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efayetj/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/usa-california-hawthorne-U73kZ5kDGCQ" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-5/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="desktop-in-content-ad post-ads "&gt; &lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt; &lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722455"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722455" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-1-682d98db2d69c-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker examining an X-ray with a focused expression while reviewing an unbelievable medical image." title="Medical worker examining an X-ray with a focused expression while reviewing an unbelievable medical image."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Years ago my then 11 year old shattered both femurs and her hip. At the time, her Orthopaedic specialist was so reassuring and confident that we had no doubts about her recovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year later, we went back for a review and he asked me if I'd like to see her trauma x-rays. Not having any idea of the reality I said yes. What I saw looked like her leg bones had exploded. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After my freaked out reaction I commented on how cool and calm he was, and how certain that she'd be fine.

It was at a soccer game, she crawled on top of a big dog called a borzoi, which startled it, it rolled over and bit her in the face. This was the late 80's, smaller town. There were no pediatric surgeons available, no plastic surgeons, she was in the ER with her face ripped open.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyways, our general pediatrician (who is now my kids pediatrician, 30 years later), who had only graduated maybe 10 years prior, sewed her face back together. It was 30 stitches on the inside of her mouth, and 30 or so on the outside. She had a massive scar down the whole side of her face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anway, fast forward 15 years. She grew normally, her face is fine, her smile is fine, no long term damage. Apparently, a face is full of nerves and muscles, and thats why only plastic surgeons work on faces. Particularly with children, having nerve and muscle damage can make their face grow crooked as they age, it is a highly specialized field. But in this case, there was nobody else, just a general pediatrician, and he managed to save her face, with no long term nerve or muscle damage, or even scarring now that shes an adult.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We found out 25 years later from our pediatrician's wife, that he spent an hour or so crunching his old med school books in the seat of his Plymouth Reliant in the hospital parking lot, studying facial anatomy, nerves and cheek structure, etc. He walked into the hospital and performed a multiple hour surgery, on her face, sewed it back together, perfectly. You would think a plastic surgeon did it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His wife told us he came home that night, just flopped down on the couch, and sat that there, amazed that he'd done it. Proud, but cautious. A new general pediatrician, sews a toddlers face back together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it worked. Now, you would never know it happened. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...and he has never, ever, done another surgery like that again lol&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;edit: if the tenses seem odd, it is because he was MY pediatrician then, and now that I am old and have a child, he is our daughters' pediatrician again. And he still calls my by my full first name which still drives me nuts. We chose him for his excellent medicine skills, not his personality. Thank you all for the gold and stories, I will share this with my sister and probably not him next time we see him, though I can promise you he doesn't know or care what reddit is. He doesn't even have a computer except the one he is forced to have at his clinic, and he calls it "henry", to spite the man who made all the doctors in his pediatrics group carry tablet pcs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efap6fb/" target="_blank"&gt; ikilledtupac &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/brown-long-coated-large-dog-_Hzg9rquaIM" target="_blank"&gt; Karolina Wv / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-2/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722467"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722467" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-9-682d9e29e4d4a-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical workers in surgical scrubs performing an operation, staying calm while handling medical tools and instruments." title="Medical workers in surgical scrubs performing an operation, staying calm while handling medical tools and instruments."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;In 2011 I had a saddle pulmonary embolism two weeks before my scheduled wedding.

It was shattered, just flattened, with splinters of bone coming out. I stared at it. He stared at it.

As I was getting him into the gown and into hospital socks, I noticed very old, yellowing bandaging around his foot. I inquired to its purpose and he told me it was a large wound on the back of his heel that wasn't getting better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I asked him if I could unwrap it to inspect it/possibly re-wrap it (basic wound care is one of my duties), and it was a literal hole in his heel about 4cm in diameter, skin necrotic around the edges, with a large flap of skin covering the middle. I wasn't terribly shocked...until I swore I saw the skin flap writhe a little bit. I got the patient's consent to look under the skin flap and sweet galactic Jesus, there were 3 sizeable maggots just chilling. I've read about it before but I have never seen it in person. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My brain went "what in the solar f*ck" and despite my attempt at a poker face, the gentleman read my reaction and asked, "Is it that bad?" I was straight up with him and told him that the wound had maggots and needed immediate treatment and the poor guy started apologizing for "bringing something disgusting." I told him, "I see this more often than you think. Maggots are actually great at cleaning out dead tissue and are used as treatment sometimes." He seemed relieved by that but it was definitely my first time ever seeing a maggot infected wound. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efathfj/" target="_blank"&gt; lilrei160 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-bunch-of-bugs-that-are-laying-on-the-ground-4OqvD8Qr4Q8" target="_blank"&gt; Bernd / unsplash (not the actual photo)Dittrich &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-9/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722466"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722466" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-11-682d9f0b69280-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical workers in surgical gowns and masks performing an operation, staying calm while facing an unbelievable situation." title="Medical workers in surgical gowns and masks performing an operation, staying calm while facing an unbelievable situation."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Lots of stories, many already covered by others. I will share this particular story with my legs crossed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Motorcyclist came in after some one left turned without checking. He had gone over the hood, slid and somehow somersaulted landing on his a*s sitting up. He slid across intersection mostly on his a*s, getting serious road rash. Luckily he was only a block from hospital and ambulance. They pack him and bring him to the ER.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We end up cutting off his chaps and jeans and begin the cleanup of gravel and sand embedded in his thighs and a*s when all of a sudden, his testicles fall out of his s*****m. He had basically sandpapered a hole in his s*****m while skidding on his a*s. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The attending pauses, grabs the saline, irrigates s*****m and nuts, fondles them back into place while humming. I handed him some gauze to pack the wound and smiled at the patient who was under a local.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then I went on break, went fetal and dry heaved. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efau9d4/" target="_blank"&gt; Assaulted_Fish &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-group-of-doctors-performing-surgery-in-a-hospital-a-g3xxk_t7s" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-12/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722477"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722477" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-19-682db04c6cdcd-png__700.jpg" alt="A medical worker wearing surgical cap, mask, and glasses, maintaining calm focus during a critical moment in the operating room." title="A medical worker wearing surgical cap, mask, and glasses, maintaining calm focus during a critical moment in the operating room."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I had to have my leg rebuilt after a car accident and was eventually sent to Duke university for my surgery. My surgeon was supposed to be like the best orthopedic surgeon in the country, I think he used to work for the Baltimore ravens. Anyway all the doctors from my hospital at home were very unsure if I would even have a functioning leg let alone walk normal again. The first appointment at Duke that dude told me it was really not a big deal and he would have me fixed almost good as new. I honestly thought he was just trying to be nice and optimistic but he was very serious. 5 months later I was walking and learning how to run again. He said I was one of the most complicated surgeries he has had to do and a group of surgeons flew in to observe him do it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efasxzv/" target="_blank"&gt; burtrenolds &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/man-wearing-medical-mask-and-robe-UIp163xCV6w" target="_blank"&gt; JC Gellidon / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-23/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722498"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722498" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not the doctor, but the patient. In 6th grade, i contracted so many different forms of dysentery that I was placed into CDC quarantine while they tried to figure out where I got it. I was barely conscious throughout the whole time but all I remember is my doctor in my room with me, having hooked up my Wii and playing Brawl as I recovered. I had no clue that my parents were being investigated for child abuse or that I was in quarantine until a few months later, or that I had passed out and had been covered in vomit and s**t for hours before my mom found me and took me to the hospital. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I ended up getting it from someone not washing their hands after handling a snake and then cooking dinner at my science camp. Wash your d**n hands people!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EDIT: I do work in the medical field, but I'm not a doctor so technically I am a medical professional.

A patient was admitted through the emergency room and told me that he hadn't been to dialysis in 4 weeks. He had HIV, kidney failure, had lost custody of his kids after a messy divorce, and had no will to live. He planned to just stay in his home until he died. He probably wasn't far from it, but a neighbor, who hadn't seen him for a few weeks, peeked in the window and saw him sitting, unresponsive on the couch. They called 911 and he was brought to my hospital. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three weeks is an insanely long time to go without dialysis. Dialysis removes toxins and excess fluid from your blood. Missing a session can leave you feeling sick and swollen. Missing 12 sessions can k**l you. This guy was SO swollen. I've never seen a person who was so full of fluid. He looked like that girl from W***y Wonka that turned into a blueberry. His feet and ankles were particularly massive. I wasn't sure that he'd live. Miraculously, after several dialysis sessions, he'd fully deflated. However, he was left with lots of loose skin afterwards, which had the fragile texture of an old balloon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night, he called me to his room and said, "I think my foot is bleeding". He was right. He'd slid down towards the bottom of his bed and used his legs to push himself back up towards the top. In doing so, the fragile skin on the bottoms of his feet and been totally sheared away, leaving only tissue and bone and so much blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had no idea what to do, so I just called a Code Blue. The patient wasn't dead or dying, but no part of nursing school or practice had prepared me for an HIV+ patient who had ripped the soles of his feet off and was currently laying in a 3ft wide, rapidlu expanding, puddle of blood. I just needed to get a whole bunch of people to the room as quickly as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I threw on a waterproof gown and some gloves and held pressure on the bottoms of his feet with a towel until help arrived. They didn't know what to do either. We called in the general surgeon, who seemed to think we might be exaggerating the extent of the damage and blood loss. He told us he'd be there in an hour and just to hold pressure until it stopped bleeding. We soaked towel after towel until, finally, the surgeon shows up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He breezes into the room, moves my towel away, and says, "hmph". Then he reaches towards the patients foot, and pulls off a a HUGE, softball sized, blood clot. In that moment, time stopped. He held out his hand, holding the huge clot, and I, without really thinking about what I was doing, held my hand out too. He plopped the clot right into my outstretched hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the next moments, several things happened all at once. I realized I was holding a big, coagulated mass of blood. I started dry heaving. I dropped it on the floor. It splattered. The surgeon exclaims, "OH JESUS F**K", not in response to my gags or the fact that he was just splattered by the clot I dropped, but because the patient's foot is now profusely bleeding again. He darts off and tells us to get the patient down to the OR immediately. We get him down there and, on the way back, realize that he'd left a trail of blood down the hallways, into the elevator, and to the operating theater.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I saw the patient during my next shift and he jokes, "I thought you were going to pass out when the doctor handed you that mess!" to which I replied, "Sir, I was positive that you were about to bleed to death".&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efb160t/" target="_blank"&gt; NurseSarahBitch &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-51/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722461"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722461" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-5-682d9b2aaa6e4-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical workers wearing masks examining X-ray scans while pretending to stay calm in a clinical setting." title="Medical workers wearing masks examining X-ray scans while pretending to stay calm in a clinical setting."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Lady came in with possible stroke symptoms (numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, gail abnormalities).

No, I didn't... I said, 'This isn't the first time someone has told me this.' This wasn't true. Turns out that he knew it was wrong, that mother had initiated it, he was trying to extricate himself, and he was desperate for help. But the thought that someone else had been in his position meant to him that he hadn't been judged, that he wasn't doomed or would go to hell, and that there was hope. But he didn't know what to do because the person to whom he should've looked for advice was actually his a****r.

My daughter, who was 3 at the time, had to have a cavity filled. As we were leaving, the dentist told me just to watch my daughter because sometimes kids chew their gums because it's numb and feels weird. So the drive home took 30 minutes and I had been talking to my daughter the entire time to keep her busy. I park my car in my drive way, opened the passenger seat to get my daughter out, and her entire lower lip on the left side is gone. She had chewed it off down to her chin. She ended up in emergency surgery, but the surgeon kept telling us it would be fine and he sees this stuff all the time. She ended up having multiple surgeries, and when she was finally healed, the surgeon told us that it was the worst injury like that he had ever seen. He wasn't sure how she would heal, but you can hardly tell it happened now.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efav67r/" target="_blank"&gt; imcloudnine &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/female-dentist-examining-teeth-of-little-girl-at-dental-clinic-mother-supporting-her-little-daughter-at-dentists-office-healthcare-2ni8EfJ9Bfg" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-38/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722462"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722462" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-6-682d9c4038ea0-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker wearing blue gloves handling medical tubing, showing calmness while seeing something unbelievable" title="Medical worker wearing blue gloves handling medical tubing, showing calmness while seeing something unbelievable"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Posted this before:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4th year med student here. On my ER rotation a couple months back, I walked in to the ED and was immediately asked to help a nurse and resident put a catheter in a patient. Now a catheter placement is usually a one person job so I was pretty confused as to why they needed my help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I walk into the patient room, and I’m immediately greeted by a disgusting rotting flesh smell. Worst thing I’ve smelled in my life. The patient has to be pushing 400 lbs and has the worst edema (soft tissue swelling) from congestive heart failure I’ve ever seen. His s*****m and p***s f******n are about the size if a small watermelon, and the f******n had swollen completely over the tip of his p***s. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The nurse had a speculum (tool OBGYNs use to look inside vaginas) inserted into the man’s f******n while the resident took the catheter in a hemostat (pliers type thing) and jammed it into the man’s pee hole for 20 minutes. They finally got the catheter in and took the speculum out. It was covered in a thick brown discharge that looked like fermented p**s-s**t. I still don’t know how he let his s*****m and p***s swell that much. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: We comforted the patient the whole time and kept telling him we had done it like this before. Total lie. No one in the ED had ever done or seen anything like it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaqetq/" target="_blank"&gt; Trisomy__21 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/close-up-of-medical-worker-with-drop-bottle-and-catheter-professional-female-doctor-in-uniform-at-hospital-diagnostic-and-clinic-support-healthcare-and-modern-medicine-concept-k5T21KKuDes" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-8/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722476"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722476" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-18-682daf81d0d05-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker with curly hair drying face with towel, pretending to be calm after seeing something unbelievable." title="Medical worker with curly hair drying face with towel, pretending to be calm after seeing something unbelievable."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;A little late to the party—&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not the worst, but I had a patient once with a stomach bleed and a small bowel obstruction. We had to put in an NG tube (tube that goes in your nose and down to your stomach) to drain/decompress his stomach, which was pretty distended and hard. &lt;br&gt;I’m inserting the tube and has soon as it hits this guy’s gag reflex he projectile vomits and SPRAYS very dark, half digested blood all over himself, the bed, the wall, and the floor. It’s basically a scene from the exorcist. I had to dive out of the way and somehow was unscathed. He couldn’t stop for almost ten minutes as we’re trying to get this thing down to where it needs to go. Finally finish placement and it immediately suctions out ~3 liters of this black sludge that is old, digested blood. Pt was mortified and we had to play it off like “oh no no it’s fine, it’s really common to vomit during the procedure. We’ll just go get some towels and clean you up!”&lt;br&gt;My coworker and I left the room and just stared at each other in silent shock.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efatxzv/" target="_blank"&gt; oh_haay &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-man-wiping-his-face-in-front-of-a-mirror-C09E-8WkjFE" target="_blank"&gt; Natalia Blauth / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-22/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722471"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722471" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-14-682da308b3bc9-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker pretending to be calm while comforting an elderly patient in a hospital room setting." title="Medical worker pretending to be calm while comforting an elderly patient in a hospital room setting."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I used to do psychiatric evaluations in an emergency room setting. One time, I'm evaluating this 60 year old woman who is lying in the hospital bed. I'm asking her questions, and she stops me and says, "Excuse me, but I need to pass some gas." I let her know that this is a medical setting and that is a completely normal body function and not to be embarrassed. People pass gas all the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was not prepared for what came next. She let it rip, and out came the loudest, wettest, and longest sounding fart I have ever heard. It was bubbly and juicy, hitting all the deep notes while ending on a squeaker. I don't think Satan could have made a noise like that with his a**s. It sounded so relieving, but then the smell hit me. It was bad enough that I started to gag and had to excuse myself from the room. When I came back I politely asked if she needed a nurse for anything in case she needed to be cleaned up after that, but she declined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obviously I've witnessed people farting before, but I've never heard or smelled anything like that before. That was something else.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efao1uo/" target="_blank"&gt; AimlessPeacock &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/an-elderly-patient-at-the-hospital-NNdO9o1qMN0" target="_blank"&gt; Curated Lifestyle / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-17/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722472"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722472" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-15-682da3965240e-png__700.jpg" alt="Person wearing a black hoodie holding a smartphone with a charging cable, illustrating medical workers pretending to be calm." title="Person wearing a black hoodie holding a smartphone with a charging cable, illustrating medical workers pretending to be calm."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Nurse in corrections here. Had an inmate/patient come in with complaints about severe lower abdominal pain. He told me that he had something stuck in his "prison pocket." Before i could ask him what he stuck up his a**s, he bends over and shows me a cord sticking out. I told him, "Don't trip, I'm sure the doctor can help you out with that. You'll be alright." Come to find out, the prong of the phone charger got caught up into something and it was stuck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As i was trying to comfort him, I started to hear this vibrating sound. So i asked him if he heard it do. He said, "It's the phone inside me that stuck with the charger."

Unfortunately, the first thing that comes out of a shotgun when it is fired is a gust of air... which changed where the gun barrel was pointed when the shot came out. The shot pellets ended up hitting everything but his heart - lungs, ribs, spleen, stomach, liver, pancreas, and large and small intestines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the OR, the attending surgeon told me to put my hand on his beating heart because that will likely be the only time in my medical career that I would touch a beating heart. I did. It was cool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He survived.

Friend of mine bought a house and I moved in with him to help fix it up, polish it and then maybe sell it. So we are in the backyard pulling weeds and cutting down vines and I see this 4 inch diameter vine with fuzzy roots attached to the brick, climbed all the way up the wall. I'm not a particularly country boy, more urban, but my friend had warned me of poison ivy in back of the house. I called him over and he said "oh don't worry, it doesn't grow that big". &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;He was wrong. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Less than a week later I'm covered, up and down both arms bad enough I look like a 3rd degree burn victim. It has gotten into my bloodstream and appeared on my legs, back, chest and even my feet (which all had been covered of course). I remember my GP looked at me with my shirt off and said in the most nonchalant voice "oh, that's not quite the WORST I've ever seen" with serious emphasis on the one word. It took me two weeks of steroids to even return to work and another two weeks to lose the last of the boils. I spent that time researching poison ivy and I have to brag, I'm an expert on how to track down and murder that f*****g plant. I hate poison ivy. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Edit - People are asking me for tips on killing the stuff. Go to your local hardware store and they will sell a container of poison ivy killer. The stuff is good but if you use it as directed I can guarantee the stuff will return time and again to haunt you. The vine originates underground, not very deeply though. Dig around (while covered in protective clothing etc) and find the main trunk of the vine. Drill holes through the vine about half the diameter of the stalk and space them about 3-5 feet (1-2 meters) apart. Pour the poison ivy killer directly into the hole. Do not dilute it. Just pour it right in. Soak the vine well, maybe 50-100ml or 1/4 - 1/2 cup, depending on the size of the vine. This should do the trick. Of course it will need to be dug up and out but it ought to be pretty dead within a week. If that doesn't do it, repeat the process a second time. Also, do this when there is no rain forecasted. Good luck and k**l it dead!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Edit 2 - Also, it seems everyone either has a story about getting it all over and hating it (I'm so sorry for you!) or telling how they are immune to it. Fun fact about that, allergies change. You can be immune all your life and then one morning wake up allergic to just about anything. Funny story to illustrate this, I told someone about my poison ivy situation once and she told me about her little brother who was apparently not allergic. He would play pranks by grabbing it and rubbing it all over himself to try to convince other people that it wasn't poison ivy. He pulled the prank one day and had a wedding to attend two days later. He suddenly developed the allergy under the suit. Moral of the story, k**l the plant when you find it. Evil evil little b*****d... &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Edit 3 - Last tip I just remembered. If you go out in the woods and suspect you are going to encounter poison ivy etc at all, bring a can of spray deodorant with you. The aluminum chloride (I think that's the chemical) in it will neutralize the oil and prevent allergic attack. Otherwise scrub with soap and water within ten - fifteen minutes after exposure.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efard08/" target="_blank"&gt; TheMisterOgre &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/green-plant-on-selective-focus-photography-Z_JF_BjNbZY" target="_blank"&gt; James Whitney / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-26/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722484"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722484" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-24-682db2cfd425f-png__700.jpg" alt="Snowboarder dressed in winter gear riding through deep snow with medical workers reacting to unbelievable scenes concept." title="Snowboarder dressed in winter gear riding through deep snow with medical workers reacting to unbelievable scenes concept."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Not a medicalprofessional, but I have impressed a couple. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not super weird but just uncommon I guess. I was overweight but active when I was younger and broke my lowest rib while snowboarding, long story short, I did not know it was broken (honestly) so I never got it checked by a doctor. The rib traveled up over the next 2 ribs and has since fused to them. I now have a permanent tilt on my spine where this rib attaches to it and now that I have lost some weight a bump you can see/feel on my chest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is kinda weird when you tell a doctor about something on your body and their face lights up like a kid on Christmas and they ask for permission to feel it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efal3qx/" target="_blank"&gt; ptsfn54a &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/photography-of-person-playing-snowboarding-during-daytime-9SGGun3iIig" target="_blank"&gt; Bradley Dunn / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-30/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722485"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722485" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-25-682db33749419-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker wearing surgical mask and glasses focused during a procedure, illustrating calm in an unbelievable moment." title="Medical worker wearing surgical mask and glasses focused during a procedure, illustrating calm in an unbelievable moment."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Years ago (2000) I was playing soccer and noticed a little skin irritation underneath my arm.

I went to the doctor who didnt have a clue and he sent me to a specialist. While there it seemed like he didnt know either. This was further evidenced when 4 other doctors came in to take a look and were really interested. They took a ton of photos and told me they hadnt seen this before and couldnt really offer any medication and said they would monitor it. About a week later the 'skin tags' developed little circles on the top that turned into scabs within a couple days. Then, the thing just kinda dried up and fell off me. It was f*****g weird and to this day I have no idea what it was. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was not comforted.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efapvbw/" target="_blank"&gt; negative_space_ &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/man-in-blue-and-white-collared-shirt-wearing-green-face-mask-odggKTyA5o0" target="_blank"&gt; National Cancer Institute / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-31/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722490"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722490" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-29-682db5dad2524-png__700.jpg" alt="Close-up of a medical worker preparing a patient's leg marked for surgery, demonstrating careful attention in a clinical setting." title="Close-up of a medical worker preparing a patient's leg marked for surgery, demonstrating careful attention in a clinical setting."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I had to see an orthopedist oncologist because I had two sarcomas. One in my left thigh in the sciatic nerve and one in my left pelvic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My surgeon said he would get both out and the most I would get would be a drop foot (where you can’t lift up your foot on your own). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went back two years later and my doctor told me he thought he would have to remove my leg because of how the sarcomas were enmeshed in my bones, muscle, and nerves. I honestly thought the whole time that it was an easy out. Though the two 10 hour surgeries may have been a clue that it wasn’t so simple. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These days I have a limp as I’m missing half my left pelvic bone and most of my glute and thigh muscle- but I got to keep the leg!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efan6cq/" target="_blank"&gt; Resse811 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-medical-professional-examines-a-knee-injury-kKEHYN6gALQ" target="_blank"&gt; Judy Beth Morris / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-36/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722493"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722493" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I was the patient in this case. Had pain in the lower right part of my abdomen that grew more serious over a few days. Eventually got so bad I nearly passed out and was on my bathroom floor screaming on the third night. That morning I felt much better and went to work, but felt the pain coming on again that evening. Also decided to go into work the next morning while running a fever that was getting steadily worse. Finally decided to go to the doctor, where they immediately referred me for a CT scan. My appendix had been ruptured for a day and a half at that point, and I had sepsis/gangrene/massive infection. I was in surgery within a few hours, but prior to that the nurse that was with me said, "Yeah, this will be no problem. You'll be fine." Surgery was ok, but was followed up with a bunch of time in the hospital on intravenous antibiotics. My primary care doctor called me while I was recovering and told me the CT scan was one of the worst they had seen. The doctors I saw post recovery all had a *holy s**t* look when they saw scans and read the surgeon's report. Kudos to that nurse who kept me calm before surgery. Don't screw around with lower abdominal pain.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efarrun/" target="_blank"&gt; blownapp &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-39/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722496"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722496" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Probably too late to the party, but I had a lady come in to the ER listed as “Multiple Medical Problems”. This usually means diabetes and the issues stemming from it or maybe bleeding issues from another disease or maybe odd blood tests results at a clinic. I hadn’t seen the patient yet, but the Dr. came to the nurse’s station asking who had room 15. I jumped up and followed him into the room. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I walked in and saw what I thought was a corpse. Then the patient’s eye swiveled over to look at me. She truly looked like one of the people they found in a concentration camp. I could see every bone and her body was twisted in a decorticate position with her jaw locked open. Then the smell hit me: rotting flesh, death, and body fluids. I struggled to keep a neutral face and not gag. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I tried to place a blood pressure cuff on her arm and her skin just started flaking off in my hands. I gagged. The dr. started removing her clothes to examine her. Her feet were black to the ankles. Her hip bones were poking through her skin and were black. The skin around her ribs was worn away to oozing muscle fibers. Her calves were incredibly swollen and the skin was splitting like ripped pants. I removed her Depends, and there was feces coating her entire genital area. Then the dr. went to remove a large bandage on her lower back. Her entire sacrum was exposed and the bones were BLACK! The skin around it was a black liquified mass. It smelled like nothing I’ve ever smelled. I can’t even describe it. The dr. Told her family I would clean up her ulcers and wounds in preparation for surgery (liar, no surgeon would operate on her). &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I had no idea how to clean dead bone tissue and liquified skin (they don’t cover that in nursing school). When I went to clean her sacral area, all the liquified skin separated and oozed all over the bed. I really struggled to keep my s**t together. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Afterwards, I needed a moment in the supply closet to cry it out for a second. I had no idea the human body could breakdown so much without dying. I still think about that woman sometimes and what led to her living like that. It still breaks my heart.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efb1pnt/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-42/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722465"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722465" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-8-682d9d6350c07-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker covering face with hands, pretending to be calm while witnessing something unbelievable indoors." title="Medical worker covering face with hands, pretending to be calm while witnessing something unbelievable indoors."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I’m an RN who specializes in wound care. We see a lot of crazy things in my clinic. A common occurrence is a pilonidal cyst, which is an abnormal growth in you gluteal cleft (aka butt crack) that contains hair. It usually happens with younger ppl (say 13-20s) and is obviously very embarrassing to the patient. When we get them, they’ve already had the surgery to open and extract the cyst, so there’s a few holes left that we have to heal. One poor soul that came in had the worst post surgical “hole” I’ve ever seen. It was so big, it extended from the top of her crack to the top of her a**s, then our on either side about 12 centimeters. It was like the surgeon carved out most of her butt :( The patient was devastated, and I tried to comfort her by telling her she’s not the worst I’ve ever seen. Poor girl.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaahhb/" target="_blank"&gt; ldshimek &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-in-brown-shirt-covering-her-face-yRB81uWKK-M" target="_blank"&gt; Fa Barboza / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-11/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722469"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722469" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-12-682d9f8706df2-png__700.jpg" alt="Male medical worker wearing a lab coat and blue gloves sitting on stairs looking stressed while pretending to stay calm" title="Male medical worker wearing a lab coat and blue gloves sitting on stairs looking stressed while pretending to stay calm"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Paramedic here. Had a homeless guy call saying he stepped on a nail "about a year ago". I could smell it from the door so I expected it to be bad, but when I went to pick up the leg by his heel there was just...nothing there. His foot just evaporated into pus and maggots and his metatarsals clinked through my fingers. While I'm standing there trying to comprehend what happened he just sighed and asked me to pick up his foot (what foot buddy?), put it back on. He said "it falls off a lot these days, but it still hurts so that's good right?" I had no clue what to tell him. The nurses thought it was hilarious that "the baby medic(that's me btw)" got grossed out.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaspn3/" target="_blank"&gt; Bronzeshadow &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/exhausted-doctor-after-very-long-shift-in-the-hospital-dKWAjrJ_7ok" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-15/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722470"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722470" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-13-682da00a3df20-png__700.jpg" alt="Young medical worker covering face with hand, pretending to stay calm while seeing something unbelievable." title="Young medical worker covering face with hand, pretending to stay calm while seeing something unbelievable."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Had a patient who needed a lower gi study to find/fix a bowel bleed. To get a study done you need to poop clear mucus. Three days we bowel prepped with heavy laxatives and enemas. He barely pooped anything. He puts on the call light at 6:45, 15 minutes before my shift ends. He calmly says, "I kinda want to try and poop." He said it so casually I figured he was going to toot out another gas bubble and walk back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He stood from the bed, took one step, and the floodgates burst. 3+ days of the most rancid liquid stool I had ever encountered. It just wouldn't stop. He left a river of stool from the bed to the bathroom, coated the walls as he bend to park his butt on the toilet, and continued to dump out 7 people worth of poop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my 9 years I have never seen that much come out of a person. He was not a large man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was so embarrassed but I just kept my face as solid as possible, grabbed half the linen closet and 3 packages of cavi wipes, and sopped it up. Told him this happens all the time.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efauur6/" target="_blank"&gt; kitten86er &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/man-in-black-long-sleeve-shirt-covering-his-face-GfXaINu45cU" target="_blank"&gt; Ethan Hooson / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-16/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722478"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722478" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-20-682db0d0aecbd-png__700.jpg" alt="Empty hospital bed with medical equipment in dim light, capturing medical workers pretending to be calm atmosphere." title="Empty hospital bed with medical equipment in dim light, capturing medical workers pretending to be calm atmosphere."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I'm the patient here and the nurses didn't even try to say they had seen it before but it still fits. When I was getting treated for cancer I got a really bad case of pneumonia and had to be intubated and put into like a semi-coma type deal (I don't remember anything that happened in those six days but I was apparently made sober enough to open my eyes for visitors every day so I don't know if that counts as a coma). It was some pretty serious pneumonia because it was like less than two days between my first cough and them making the call that I would need to be intubated to stop me from drowning in my own fluids, so they didn't mess around and gave me a ton of antibiotics. You know how some hospital beds have a track along the ceiling that they can hang IV bags from? I had enough antibiotics hanging from mine that it broke and fell to the floor (again, no memory of this).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the thing that was truly unprecedented occurred when they were changing out my butt-bag (I don't fully understand what it was but they had something on or under my butt that collected all my bowel movements, they put it on after I was heavily sedated, and removed it before I was totally awake so I don't really remember it). For anyone who doesn't know, antibiotics can cause a lot of diarrhea. Apparently when they rolled me on my side that day I let loose a fire-hose of liquid s**t that arched through the air across the room and splattered all over the door and window which were about twelve feet away from my bed. I think it's super cool and funny so they didn't have to pretend like it was normal to comfort me.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaht4f/" target="_blank"&gt; FlutestrapPhil &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-hospital-room-with-a-bed-and-a-monitor-CjgwW0VR3d0" target="_blank"&gt; Frederic Köberl / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-24/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722479"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722479" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-21-682db135f113e-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical workers showing calmness while holding a child, capturing genuine emotions in an unbelievable moment." title="Medical workers showing calmness while holding a child, capturing genuine emotions in an unbelievable moment."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Medical student here.

Which may be true, but they are usually dead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He lived for almost a day after shooting himself, then died in the back of my ambulance.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efai3bm/" target="_blank"&gt; pokemon-gangbang &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/man-and-woman-sitting-on-sofa-in-a-room-e92L8PwcHD4" target="_blank"&gt; Ben White / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-3/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722482"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722482" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Ooh, me, I have a story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've been an RN for 12 years now, seen a lot of s**t. I was particularly lucky in nursing school and got to watch open heart surgery, joint replacement, kidney removal, all kinds of neat stuff right over the surgeon's shoulder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only one that ever gave me a problem was this kid about 10 years old getting his tonsils removed. The doc had this hooked knife, he's reach into the kids mouth, hook the tonsil, and yank it back to cut it out. Blood flying out of the unconscious kid's mouth. So I'm standing there, I look up and all of a sudden everything's getting sparkly. I just said "I need to leave. Right now."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surgeon takes his tools out of the kid's mouth and says "OK. Someone please walk him out, thanks." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I learned that for some reason, I get queasy when it's kids being hurt. Which is funny, because I was a pediatrics nurse for quite a while after school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, the actual story. I wasn't even at work, but maybe four years ago, was living with my girlfriend at the time and her three young boys. That day, the youngest (about 7), had been climbing up a big lilac bush in the yard that I'd trimmed the day before. He slipped and fell out. A sharp, cut branch caught him in the face on his way down. I was in the kitchen, and heard this blood-curdling scream and ran outside. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I brought him in, sat him on the kitchen table and took a look. It seemed like he was pretty lucky, there was just a deep cut on the bottom of his nose. Well, it was bleeding pretty decently so his mother and I took him to the emergency room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We get there, there's only a physician's assistant on duty. He takes a look and thinks maybe it could use a couple of stitches. Or, he says, he could call the on-call ENT surgeon for another opinion. We told him that, all due respect, we would like to have a surgeon take a look, just in case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good thing we did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The boy had nearly taken his entire nose off his face. The stick cut up under the nose, and traveled along under the flesh up to the bridge. The entire nose was hanging by a half inch of skin at the top. We just hadn't moved it much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As soon as the surgeon came in and pulled this little boy's nose off his face, while he's laying on the exam table screaming absolute bloody murder, suddenly I got really hot, things start getting hazy, I realize I'm about to pass out. So I quickly exited the room and sat down, at the exact same time as my girlfriend, who was also a nurse. Neither of us could take it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaj1mk/" target="_blank"&gt; Gullex &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-28/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722488"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722488" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-28-682db581e748a-png__700.jpg" alt="Newborn baby wrapped in a blanket yawning, a common sight for medical workers staying calm in surprising moments." title="Newborn baby wrapped in a blanket yawning, a common sight for medical workers staying calm in surprising moments."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I'm a nurse and I work in a pediatric ER. A young woman brought her baby in to be seen for vomiting. I ask her to put the baby on the scale. While on the scale I notice a strong odor of bug spray so I asked about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mom: "A roach crawled into her mouth so I sprayed a little Raid in there." She said it matter of factually like it was no big deal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Que up calls to the police, CPS and a 1:1 sitter for the child and the mom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When all was said and done the baby was fine and turned over to her grandmother so no worries there. I have no idea what happened to the mother. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't believe she was intending to hurt the child.

I obviously didn't treat the patient myself, but I discussed his case with his doctor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The patient had severe anxiety and therefore hadn't been to a doctor of any kind in approximately twenty years. He ended up in our office because his wife had called the day before and expressed that he needed to be seen due to a foot infection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he arrived, he approached the window and told the receptionist that he was sorry because his socks were dirty as he hadn't made it to the laundromat recently, which was a bit weird in and of itself, but we work for a podiatrist--we've seen it all before, as it were. He then sat in the waiting room, and it was mere moments before the smell seeped into the administration office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The receptionist put him in an exam room as quickly as possible, and upon her return, she informed me that the infection was literally oozing out of his sneaker. All we could do was open the widows and apologize to other patients as they arrived. It was foul, and when I entered the room after his appointment to clean it (the medical assistant was out that day), I immediately began gagging and had to forcefully push my manager out of the way as to avoid vomiting on her on my way to the restroom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it turned out, the dude had had the infection for approximately three months, and had been showering with his sock on since he'd discovered it. He literally hadn't removed his sock from his infected foot in three months, and his wife had somehow been living with the overwhelming smell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The doctor said it was the worst infection he'd ever seen, but the patient was so incredibly anxious that he got the standard, "I've seen it all before," throughout his appointment.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efat2ul/" target="_blank"&gt; MedusaExceptWithCats &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-49/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722504"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722504" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Yep.

One called it a ticking time bomb. His heart had 2 chambers instead of the normal 4. He didn't have the big arteries that led from the heart to the lungs but a series of smaller ones. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will never forget the first time I saw him take his shirt off and you could literally see his heart beating in his skinny chest. Literally, every beat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the age of 25, 3 years after we were married, the time bomb blew. 7 years later I very vividly remember his chest moving as his f****d up heart beat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efay1co/" target="_blank"&gt; ZoraTheDucky &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-53/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722508"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722508" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;In dental school, I had an emergency patient come in, complaining of sore gums. Upon examination, I found a massive calculus bridge (google it for pictures) behind her lower front teeth. She only had about 3 remaining lower teeth, but they were all connected with a whitish brown mineral deposit that was about the size of a golf ball. She had never had her teeth cleaned and she was probably 55 or so. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I basically performed an emergency cleaning. She could speak so much better afterwords. Of course I had to play it off like it was normal, but in my years of practice I still haven’t seen a case that bad again. Get your teeth cleaned people. Even if you can’t afford every 6 months, once a year, or every other year is a hell of a lot better than never.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efawcda/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-54/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722511"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722511" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Worked in a heart procedure lab that helped try to get rid of bad heart rhythms. A prisoner came in for a last ditch effort to help his failing heart and had developed a condition called Ventricular Tachycardia. Setting the patient up and looking at his rhythm / heart, it looked pretty bad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Before we got started he grabbed me on the arm and said "I'm scared. Is it going to be okay?" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We have very talented physicians here sir, and they do this all the time."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ventricular Tachycardia was set off during the procedure and deteriorated into Ventricular Fibrillation.

I got the cart set up for a vaginal exam, got her vitals, blood and urine (she couldnt pee because of the pain she said), all the basic jazz you do when someone comes into the ER. I process my samples and let the nurse know everything is done and she goes to talk to the woman and it essentially goes as this: no, she hasn't had any trauma, no no a*****t, no she doesn't know what's going on, but it started about 3 weeks prior. Long story short, we get the Dr as the woman refused to let the nurse take a look, and we are all in the room when the Dr turns the light on under the drape and immediately asks if she's been using any medication vaginally, there's clearly a lot of irritation and swelling as well as a VERY strong odor and she hadn't even inserted the spec yet. The woman says no, nothing. At this point the nurse goes to get some saline and I'm left to hand off tools and handle any swabs. The first swab handed to me was literally tinged a pale green, clearly infection. I'm capping it and the woman smells the odor slowly filling the room finally and starts apologizing. I had to say while trying not to gag "no no need to apologize, I've seen much crazier things, just relax and we will get you all fixed up." Well, the nurse comes back with saline and the Dr starts essentially flushing this woman's v****a trying to clear out all this discharge and infection so she can see what's going on, and all of the sudden she stops and asks if she's SURE she hasn't been putting anything in her v****a to treat any medical condition, even something not given by a Dr. And that's when we found out for about a month, this woman had been douching with a bleach and water mix to try and cure a yeast infection, because she read that "in hospitals we wash down with diluted bleach to k**l germs and thought it would work." She was riddled with chemical burns and infection and was immediately transported to a bigger hospital. So yeah, that happened. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efatinp/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-14/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722487"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722487" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-27-682db4485f40c-png__700.jpg" alt="Blurred runners in motion during a city marathon with medical workers on standby for emergencies and support." title="Blurred runners in motion during a city marathon with medical workers on standby for emergencies and support."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Obligatory not a medical professional, but a first aider.

I got called in on a Saturday for a lady who had an infection from a component separation. Basically they put a giant piece of mesh in you for hernias. I wasn’t prepared. When we lifted up her gown.... the smell wafted and I have never almost puked before until that moment. About 20 cm circle around her umbillicus was black and necrotic. It was absolutely awful. We basically removed the entirety of the necrotic tissue all the way down to the peritoneum. Just gray and black slimy mass of fat and skin. The worst part is that I had to measure the necrotic tissue and it requires me to lean in a little close to it. The surgeon was laughing because I was green when I got back to the surgical field. Then during that surgery another person who had the same procedure had come to the ER with an infection. AND THEN A THIRD!

P*o + blood = murder most foul. And the patient is sometimes a sweet, incredibly sick little granny watching us gag as we clean her up, apologizing for the smell, and we have to just say, from behind the peppermint oil-soaked mask, “oh sweetie, it’s okay, we do this all the time...”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Dead, sloughed intestinal lining.

He wasn’t able to pee more than a few drops at a time, so we used a little ultrasound machine to see how much urine was in his bladder. More than 1000ml... you just bought a catheter sir.

They were fused to his skin from the middle of the hip all the way down to his calf. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They had to surgically remove his jeans by basically cutting the skin around the point where it was fused, and the moment the scalpel made the first incision, she described it as "As if Slimer from Ghostbusters barfed out of his leg." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently, there was enough gushing, green fluid, filled with maggots, that it covered the floor in the (small) examination room, and the nurse ran out of the room gagging. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After getting over the initial shock, they managed to peel a good amount of the skin off with the pant leg, and revealed that his lower leg had basically rotted all the way to the bone, and was full of maggots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently that's the moment when she knew she was meant for the job. Even the surgeon was having a pretty hard time keeping his composure, but she was fine. More fascinated than anything, and apparently not affected by bad smells as most people are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They had to tell him his leg was going to be OK - he was severely mentally ill and might have freaked the hell out - despite knowing he could die from the infection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently he survived and they managed to save the leg, which is beyond incredible.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efav3b3/" target="_blank"&gt; Bonghead13 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-45/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722502"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722502" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Orthopedic Xray tech here.

Apparently the surgeon had a photo taken, post extraction, where he is cradling my dad's ~22.0 lb spleen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To top it off, one day into recovery, when doing on of those "gentle push on the abdomen" type exams on him, my dad's sutures catastrophically failed and he let loose a spray that coated the doctor, his nurse, and a good portion of the ceiling. Luckily for dad, the hospital staff was on point that day and kept him alive despite his body's best effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I heard all of this from the doctor while he was removing the line of staples (that went from c****h to sternum) some weeks later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dad didn't like to share, apparently.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efauzo8/" target="_blank"&gt; CallousJack &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-55/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722517"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722517" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I was working as a CNA in a nursing home. There was a lady who had been neglected before she came in so she had stage 4 bed sores (all the way to the bone) and the treatment nurse wanted me because I am calming and really good with the residents that needed a little support. She has me roll her on her side and then carefully peels back the bandage. I'm staring done in half horror/ half fascination as I can clearly see the bone, ligaments, muscle, layers of skin... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm gawking hard and the nurse is showing me some neat procedure when I hear a small, frail voice, "Is it getting better?" I turn on my biggest, friendliest smile and reply, "It does! It looks SO much better. Does it feel better?" She smiles and nods; I change the subject to grand kids (she had a picture of them). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I haven't seen anything like it before or since.

Think of the leg bone as a capital L, with the bottom of the L hooking into the hip- his were cleanly broken through the bottom sections on both sides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out he'd had occult fractures on both sides the X rays didn't initially see, and walking on them collapsed them. Never seen that before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another was a patient with shoulder injury, both sides. Got an MRI, and both shoulders were basically destroyed. Complete failure of the rotator cuff on both sides, with the humerus being drawn up and back on each side.

So basically you could just have a look at him and tell that something was very, very wrong.&lt;br&gt;He stuttered that his wife was absent so he took some time to watch ''some videos of a certain s**y type online that inspired him''. Internally I started screaming, but on the outside I just nodded and acted like it was something I heard routinely. He proceeded to explain to me he had seen a video of someone putting a metal rod up his urethra and tried the same. But he used too much lube and it slipped inside. I remember stopping breathing for a second. He was just so embarrassed that I told him that this happens sometimes and we had seen it before. Well, no. Stuff up the butt, yeah, we see that. But this was a first. I pulled up the ultrasound machine hoping this was just a training situation by my attending to prank me, but nope, there was a glorious 10 cm long pen inside this man's bladder. &lt;br&gt;So he had hoped to have it extracted magically at the ER and then to go home. Well, he had to have surgery and stay overnight, his wife eventually found out. I kept the picture of the ultrasound as a souvenir and this memory as a great story to tell friends when they ask how my ''routine life'' is going as a (now) doctor.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efar49f/" target="_blank"&gt; chocpretzel &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-60/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722516"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722516" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I’m a surgeon. &lt;br&gt;A couple of years ago they send us this guy (52 yes old) that had shown up in the ER because he allegedly hadn’t pooped in a week or so. &lt;br&gt;To make a long story short X-ray showed he had SOMETHING lodged in his r****m (and sigma, and descending colon... so way up there) that was a little over a foot long. &lt;br&gt;He denied having put anything up there. Yeah, right.&lt;br&gt;We try to go from the bottom up and nothing. We see something but we can’t clamp onto it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So. What now.&lt;br&gt;Operating room. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ended up opening him up, and inside the colon we see a hand. I just about s**t myself, ended up being a mannequin’s arm. Like store mannequin.

I went in once and they needed to do a strep test. I have a really strong gag reflex, so I warned him about it before he did the test. Dude looks me dead in the eyes and says, "You're not going to gag.".&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efask8t/" target="_blank"&gt; itsbeck &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-65/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722521"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722521" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I was the patient. In middle school I somehow coughed so hard it tore a small hole in my lung. Everyone assured me it was more common then you would think, and that it's actually not to hard to fix. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believed them until they asked if the med students could observe. Well of course!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About 30 of them filed in, lined up, and took turns squeezing my neck (where the escaped air ended up settling), and going "hmmm" "well would you look at that" and "oh my".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After they left I told my doctor "You know, for how common this apparently is, all those students seemed pretty interested in it." He replied with a half guilty grin and a nod, like yeah bud I caught you but can't really blame you for trying to calm me down.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efats8x/" target="_blank"&gt; BoredsohereIam &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-67/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bored Panda</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 23:02:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9FSS1iektLQmlSSjVLWUpGRHU4WVNDeGRRa1A1WHhmRnhWQld6ZkdkMkhIMWxFSzVtVjAwZHFRUWdGTUhYZEI2UFJjMHVUTHpndEI5ek9kWG5oRjRMYlRHd1RQNmpvb2ttcXRuNHFRa2dINTNhSFA0</guid></item><item><title>在弗吉尼亚州确诊的第二例麻疹病例- WTOP | 2nd case of measles confirmed in Virginia - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQNFNhWHJxNHhWdlFfVXVhcllUeFJUVS1UeW5nOU8wc0FON3VCUWtZYjBWaUxfWWpFVFh4dXBrSjZoMnhhbVNJLTRQSW1lNnZSLXdjNFg2cEdQX2Vpc2ZHRXdpRGhRdGFUTU9CSGF0MlJyeFNEV21FZk1Ha3pKLWNDeG0tUjd5ZnJYSXhmYjBB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;A second case of measles has been confirmed in Virginia this year, health officials said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A second case of measles has been confirmed in Virginia this year, health officials said on Friday. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Virginia Department of Health said it was a teenager from the northwest region of the state who had recently traveled outside the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials released the following locations and times of when and where the teen could have exposed others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charlottesville Albemarle Airport between 2:15 and 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play it Again Sports store on 1885 Seminole Trail in Charlottesville between 2:40 and 5 p.m. on Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodwill Store and Donation Center on 440 Gander Drive in Charlottesville between 3:10 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UVA Health Primary Care Riverside clinic on 2335 Seminole Lane, Suite 200 in Charlottesville, from 2 to 7:10 p.m. on Thursday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UVA Health University Medical Center Emergency Department on 1215 Lee Street in Charlottesville between midnight and 6 a.m. on Friday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2025/04/virginia-department-of-health-warns-of-potential-measles-exposure-in-woodbridge-fredericksburg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the first measles case was reported in Virginia&lt;/a&gt; — a child under 4 years old who possibly exposed other people in clinics in Fredericksburg and Woodbridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/blog/2025/05/23/virginia-health-officials-confirm-second-2025-measles-case-in-the-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Virginia Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; said, “measles is a highly contagious illness that can spread easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should contact your health care provider immediately if you have symptoms of measles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that there are 1,046 confirmed measles cases, up 22 from last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;Texas, where the nation’s biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed only 10&lt;/a&gt; more cases this past week for a total of 728.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three other &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mexico-canada-ontario-0956a30c043b030ae79bc9f67c6ce89c"&gt;major outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in North America. One in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/Documents/M/24/measles-ontario-epi-summary.pdf?rev=323859266e21469b8b97a294d6c6f98e&amp;amp;sc_lang=en"&gt;1,795 cases&lt;/a&gt; from mid-October through May 20, an increase of 173 cases in a week. Another in Alberta, Canada, has sickened &lt;a href="https://www.alberta.ca/measles"&gt;538 as of Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. And the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-measles-vaccines-misinformation-mmr-mennonites-misinformation-ea6158b9a4d513b20f33cbc09034e5c2"&gt;Mexican state of Chihuahua&lt;/a&gt; had 1,578 measles cases and three deaths as of Friday, according to data from the state health ministry.&lt;/p&gt;

Next week, protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s called “vibrio,” which covers as many as 12 kinds of bacteria in our waters and on the things we take from our waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection it causes is called “vibriosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No two men know vibriosis better than Richard Empson and Cornell Arceneaux.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Both are survivors. Some infected with one among the 12 in this group of bacteria have not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both have stories to tell, stories they hope will prevent fishermen and beachgoers the pain they have endured, and spare some the agony of an even worse fate for their families.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;It was 2016, Empson was wading in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, vacationing and fishing with his family. It was summer and warm coastal water — water temperatures above 70 degrees — is primed for one of this bacteria’s killer — vibrio vulnificus , the flesh-eating bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, sometime in August, Empson attended Sunday Mass at St. Thomas More in Baton Rouge. Each hand clutched a walking cane. He needed both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Got vibrio,” he said. “At the hospital (in Mississippi) I was told, ‘Your leg or your life.’ I chose life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Empson said he believes vibrio vulnificus attacked his right leg on the fifth fishing day.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“My grandson fished every day just like me, but his immune system must have been stronger than mine,” Empson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He began feeling symptoms that night. They packed up the next day, and he said he believed he could make it to Baton Rouge for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We left about 11 (a.m.) and I told my grandson to find a hospital nearby. I couldn’t make it home. We got to the emergency room in Bay St. Louis, and when they found out we’d been at the beach, they were calling for a surgeon, and they immediately moved me into intensive care.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said a doctor looked at his leg, saw blisters forming and told him he had a two-hour window “...t o receive medication to counteract what was happening. Otherwise, they would have to amputate the leg. He told me I had a 20% chance of the medication working, and I told him to take the leg, that I could learn to walk again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks in the hospital and more weeks of rehab in Baton Rouge left him with two canes. Now, he needs one to get around, to do yard work and fish – “I fish only from the bank. I still have a boat, but haven’t been in it for years. I still want to fish.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“The only thing I can’t figure is that I didn’t have a scratch on my leg, and the (hospital) staff believe it entered through my pores.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arceneaux, a never-say-die fisherman, is a three-time victim, twice from cuts while handling shrimp and crabs, and once after eating raw oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The external variety, the vulnificus, is much more virulent than vibrio gastroenteritis, the strain from raw shellfish, although Arceneaux tells of a lawyer he knew who ate an oyster poboy and was dead 24 hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arceneaux’s advice is to be cautious when buying live bait.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“Live-bait tanks in the marina are a petri dish for staph, strep and vibrio,” Arceneaux said. “Handling shrimp in contaminated watercraft is the way I got vibrio the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The second time I was handling five dozen crabs to entertain friends. I kept the crabs in a crab call (a basket submerged in water next to his camp) and I got a scratch on my arm. That was on a Thursday and within 24 hours I was on the way to the hospital and had surgery within two hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a photo of Empson is easy on the eyes, and easy to show the near-immediate effects of this virulent strain of vibrio, images of Arceneaux’s arm split open – a surgeon removed all the dead tissue — is gruesome. Even the image of scars running from hand to shoulder are not for the squeamish.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“It was 36 hours at the Baton Rouge General for the next one. To survive, I’m lucky twice, very lucky,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;While coastal water is the usual contact point for vibrio, Empson said his support group in Baton Rouge has a member who lost a leg after getting vibrio from False River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The CDC says…&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has pages devoted to vibrio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among its key points is that vibrio’s variety of bacteria “naturally live in coastal waters,” that you can get vibriosis after swallowing the bacteria or getting it in a wound, that the bacteria count is higher in coastal waters from May through October, and, if you suspect an infection, to seek medical care immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="6"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency estimates around 80,000 cases of vibriosis occur each year in our country, and 52,000 cases come from eating contaminated food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common gastric signs/symptoms are watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signs of bloodstream infection include fever, chills and the two indicators for Empson, dangerously low blood pressure and blistering skin lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;And, for wound infection, signs/symptoms are fever, redness, pain, swelling, warmth, skin discoloration, leaking fluids discharge and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the CDC warns about preexisting conditions, complications like liver disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV, thalassemia; taking medicine to decrease stomach acid levels; and, recent stomach surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="7"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vibrio vulnificus, the CDC’s warning is clear: “Many people with the infection can get seriously ill and need intensive care or limb amputation. About 1 in 5 people with this infection die, sometimes within a day or two of becoming ill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arceneaux said he continues to fish and enjoy oysters, the latter only when coastal water temperatures dip below 70 degree.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;He said he carries enough hand sanitizer, a chlorine bleach-water mixture and antibacterial soap on his fishing trips to immediately treat scratches. Puncture wounds need more attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arceneaux message is clear: “In 11 days, I had three surgeries and had two IVs treating me with four different antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You cannot fix this yourself. If you suspect you have a problem with vibrio, go to a hospital emergency room immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
