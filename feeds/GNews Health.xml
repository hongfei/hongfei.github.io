In a rat model, animals exposed to high alcohol levels performed significantly worse on a complex, shifting-reward task, even after nearly three months of sobriety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These decision-making deficits were linked to weakened neural activity in the dorsomedial striatum, a brain region crucial for evaluating choices. The findings suggest that alcohol-induced brain changes may underlie poor judgment and relapse in people with alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent Damage:&lt;/strong&gt; Alcohol-exposed rats showed impaired decision-making months after withdrawal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Brain Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Damage was found in the dorsomedial striatum, a decision-making hub.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Differences Noted:&lt;/strong&gt; Effects were seen in male rats but not females, suggesting sex-based variability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;JHU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time researchers demonstrate in an animal how heavy alcohol use leads to long-term behavioral issues by damaging brain circuits critical for decision-making.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rats exposed to high amounts of alcohol exhibited poor decision-making during a complex task even after a monthslong withdrawal period. Key areas of their brains had undergone dramatic functional changes compared to healthy rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108365"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a man drinking and a brain in a glass." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/aud-brain-cognition-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;One surprise was how long alcohol dependence impairs cognition and neural function, even after withdrawal. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published today in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, provide a new explanation of alcohol’s long-term effects on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have a new model for the unfortunate cognitive changes that humans with alcohol use disorder show,” said author Patricia Janak, a Johns Hopkins University neuroscientist who studies the biology of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that humans who are addicted to alcohol can show deficits in learning and decision-making that may contribute to their poor decisions related to alcohol use. We needed an animal model to better understand how chronic alcohol abuse affects the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing what is happening in the brain of an animal when they are having these decision-making difficulties will tell us what is happening in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments led by first author Yifeng Cheng, a research scientist in Janak’s lab who studies alcohol’s effects on the brain, rats recieved very high alcohol exposure for a month. Then after a withdrawal period of nearly three months, the rats were given a reward-based decision-making test along with a control group of rats that had not been exposed to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a reward, rats were given a choice of two levers. Pressing one lever led to a higher likelihood of reward than pressing the other lever. Rats easily learn which lever results in the most reward, so the researchers complicated things by every few minutes switching which lever had the highest reward likelihood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the most reward, a rat should rapidly change its behavior every time it figures out that the reward likelihood has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a difficult task that required memory and strategy. The alcohol-exposed rats performed considerably worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous experiments in animals weren’t comparable to humans with alcohol use disorder because the animals didn’t demonstrate deficits in rapid decision-making. The team believes this was because tasks in earlier experiments were too easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our experiment was quite challenging and the alcohol-exposed rats just couldn’t do it as well,” Janak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the right answer was constantly changing, the control rats made the best decisions faster. They were more strategic. And when we looked at their brains, the control rats’ decision-related neural signals were stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team linked the behavioral difficulties to dramatic functional transformations in the dorsomedial striatum, a part of the brain critical for decision-making. The alcohol had damaged neural circuits causing alcohol-exposed rats to process information less effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One surprise was how long alcohol dependence impairs cognition and neural function, even after withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may give us insight into why relapse rates for people addicted to alcohol are so high,” Janak said. “Alcohol-induced neural deficits may contribute to decisions to drink even after going to rehab. We can clearly demonstrate these deficits can be long-lasting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team only found the behavioral and neural impairments only in male rats. The team does not believe this suggests female rats are immune from the effects of alcohol, but that there could be sex-related sensitivities in long-term alcohol effects on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers next hope to explore how alcoholism affects other areas of the brain that interact with the dorsomedial striatum, and what might be causing the differences between males and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors include Robin Magnard, a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins; Angela J. Langdon of the National Institutes of Health; and Daeyeol Lee, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Neuroscience and Psychological and Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AUD and cognition research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3a504855495f547a50524f145f5e4f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Jill Rosen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jhu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JHU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jill Rosen – JHU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adt0200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chronic Ethanol Exposure Produces Sex-Dependent Impairments in Value Computations in the Striatum&lt;/a&gt;” by Patricia Janak et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic Ethanol Exposure Produces Sex-Dependent Impairments in Value Computations in the Striatum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value-based decision-making relies on the striatum, where neural plasticity can be altered by chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure, but the effects of such plasticity on striatal neural dynamics during decision-making remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the long-term impacts of EtOH on reward-driven decision-making and striatal neurocomputations in male and female rats using a dynamic probabilistic reversal learning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a prolonged withdrawal period, EtOH-exposed male rats exhibited deficits in adaptability and exploratory behavior, with aberrant outcome-driven value updating that heightened preference for chosen action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These behavioral changes were linked to altered neural activity in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), where EtOH increased outcome-related encoding and decreased choice-related encoding. In contrast, female rats showed minimal behavioral changes with distinct EtOH-evoked alterations of neural activity, revealing significant sex differences in the impact of chronic EtOH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings underscore the impact of chronic EtOH exposure on adaptive decision-making, revealing enduring changes in neurocomputational processes in the striatum underlying cognitive deficits that differ by sex.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 22:10:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5rVW94c3Bva2FWdWItUE9SdkV2a082VGNnMEw5WUlpWi16QWl5R1hkcFhwcTBkNGtwa2c2dGgzUEd6cGhqY2ptZ1VWNlMyWGdMUjkxSmtfSUZqMUc3YmFxZXV4elhOdw</guid></item><item><title>Shingles is awful, but here’s another reason to get vaccinated: It may fight dementia - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOMGprSnRzRmw5SFhPQWJmMnRhemRDUHozOXJQVk5GTWVaY1Z2RUpqeHd3T09QeU1IWF9kNzdQRmVJaXpZNDlNaHJmUk8xc2NrRUozRnZCYVZvSUI2TDRiTk1uRGpsZmNVa2tnNkF1d19wTW4yZjh0UXZZd0VIanZJcVRES29zTmhtRlhGeGlaOGpEcExCQWpiTnJIaVk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOMGprSnRzRmw5SFhPQWJmMnRhemRDUHozOXJQVk5GTWVaY1Z2RUpqeHd3T09QeU1IWF9kNzdQRmVJaXpZNDlNaHJmUk8xc2NrRUozRnZCYVZvSUI2TDRiTk1uRGpsZmNVa2tnNkF1d19wTW4yZjh0UXZZd0VIanZJcVRES29zTmhtRlhGeGlaOGpEcExCQWpiTnJIaVk</guid></item><item><title>As Measles Makes Inroads in Texas, Vaccine Clinics Close - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPeXlaQUJoZGNVZGYtbTVtQ01YSFNxVmFMWXh2Q1NJX20yaGZtRnM3WlVBRzZGZmxSRTJIb0ZtcU44X2diZUtXTzU0XzBVODVadU5Pb1J2VUtDLTdLVzBwTm9IdDhvb3VkeGtTZEZnZzI3SVkxYmtWMEk0S282QU1ueURSREZBb19lZzJQV2dsdWIzTy1LZktBWjVhWk8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                        As the Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/story/366512/vast-layoffs-begin-at-hhs.html"&gt;undergoes mass layoffs&lt;/a&gt;, Texas is feeling its own health-related consequences as a result of billions of dollars in federal funding cuts imposed by the Trump administration. One of those consequences: the shuttering of free measles vaccine clinics in one major county, right as the state is dealing with a &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/story/365868/texas-measles-count-almost-as-high-as-us-total-for-2024.html"&gt;continuing measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.

The Texas Department of State Health Services says that most of the cases have emerged in people who aren't vaccinated, or whose vaccination status isn't clear. The majority of the cases involve children.

                    &lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak that started in Texas in late January continues to grow. As of March 27, 2025, confirmed cases across the United States reached 483, surpassing the total number of confirmed cases recorded in 2024. About 93 percent of the cases are associated with the outbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas/2025/03/18/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-spreads-across-3-states-as-case-numbers-swell/"&gt;which now spans Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-us-surpasses-case-count-2024"&gt;The vast majority of cases&lt;/a&gt; are in people who are not vaccinated. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/public-health-officials-say-cdc-cuts-misinformation-top-down-hinders-measles-response"&gt;a lack of clarity from health authorities&lt;/a&gt; is leaving people with questions about whether they need to get revaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Q&amp;amp;A with The Conversation U.S., &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vbYSl7sAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Daniel Pastula&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist and medical epidemiologist from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and Colorado School of Public Health, explained how and when you should take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should adults get another shot of the measles vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine, which first &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lpm.2022.104149"&gt;became available in the U.S. in 1963&lt;/a&gt;, contains a live but significantly weakened strain of the measles virus. This modified strain is too weak to cause measles, but it is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2017.0143"&gt;similar enough to the wild type measles virus&lt;/a&gt; to train the immune system to recognize it. Most people who have received the live measles vaccine won’t need an additional shot now, but here is what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People born before 1957 are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html#cdc_generic_section_2-presumptive-evidence-of-immunity"&gt;presumed to have lifelong immunity&lt;/a&gt; because measles was so contagious that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;almost everyone contracted it before age 15&lt;/a&gt;. Unless there are special circumstances, they probably don’t need a vaccine now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people born after 1957 would have received the shot as children, so they should be set for life. Physicians and public health experts &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;don’t recommend most people in this group get a second measles shot&lt;/a&gt;, though there are exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, a limited outbreak of measles &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.me.43.020192.002315"&gt;occurred among vaccinated school children&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;recommendations changed from one dose&lt;/a&gt; of the live measles vaccine to two doses for children. People fully vaccinated as children after that year &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;do not need any additional doses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The CDC recommends: MMR - First dose: 12-15 months old, second dose: 4-6 years old. MMRV - First dose: 12-15 months old, second dose: 4-6 years old (but can also be given 3 months after first dose)" srcset="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5.jpg 1080w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5-240x300.jpg 240w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5-768x960.jpg 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5-425x531.jpg 425w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-514718" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Graphic by Steff Staples/PBS News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exceptions to these guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two special circumstances where the previous recommendations may not hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, if you were vaccinated between 1963 and 1967, one of the measles vaccines available at the time consisted of just proteins from the virus rather than a live, weakened version of it. Researchers soon realized this &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2012.301075"&gt;inactivated, or “killed,” vaccine was less effective&lt;/a&gt; and didn’t provide long-term immunity. Unless you know for certain you received the live vaccine, physicians and public health experts recommend that people vaccinated during those years &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;get one dose of the live vaccine&lt;/a&gt; at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, if you fall into a high-risk group – for example, if you are a health care provider, are traveling internationally or attending college, physicians and public health experts generally &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;recommend getting a second dose&lt;/a&gt; if you have only had one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_514668" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-514668" class="wp-image-514668 size-full" src="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7.jpg" alt='Who should consider getting a booster? The CDC says most people who receive two doses of a measles vaccine following the U.S. vaccination schedule are "protected for life." You might need a booster if you received a measles vaccine before 1968, as that shot was not as effective as the current ones. Talk to your health care provider about what is best for you.' srcset="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7.jpg 1080w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7-240x300.jpg 240w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7-768x960.jpg 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7-425x531.jpg 425w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-514668" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Graphic by Steff Staples/PBS News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most adults without such risk factors, physicians and public health experts &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;do not routinely recommend a second dose&lt;/a&gt; if you have previously received one dose of a live measles vaccine. If you have questions or concerns about your situation, make sure to ask your health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except in very rare circumstances, there is no recommendation for a third dose of the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can you find out whether you’ve been vaccinated?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be able to! It’s worth checking. &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/official-guidance/state-policies/state-websites/"&gt;States actually keep vaccine records&lt;/a&gt; specifically for this reason, where you can look up your vaccine records or that of your kids. Your high school or college may still have your records, and so might your pediatrician’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should you get your antibody levels checked?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people, probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A titer test &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/antibody-titer"&gt;checks the level of antibodies in your blood&lt;/a&gt;, and some people are asking their doctor to check their titers to determine whether they are still immune to measles. The problem is, the level of antibodies in your blood does not necessarily reflect your level of immunity. That’s because antibodies are &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279364/"&gt;just one part of your immune system’s infection-fighting force&lt;/a&gt;. Having a low level of antibodies does not necessarily mean your immunity has waned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other crucial elements of your immune response include &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/t-cells--b-cells-and-the-immune-system.h00-159465579.html"&gt;B cells, T cells and other immune cells&lt;/a&gt;, but a titer test does not show their capabilities. For example, memory B cells might not currently be making antibodies against the virus but are primed to quickly do so the next time they see it. This is why antibody and titer tests should be used only in specific cases, in consultation with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_514671" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-514671" class="wp-image-514671 size-full" src="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-8.jpg" alt="Is there a test to check your immunity to measles? The CDC recommends locating your vaccination records to see if you have received either the MMR or MMRV vaccine. You can also ask a health care provider to administer a blood test to determine if you are immune." srcset="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-8.jpg 1080w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-8-240x300.jpg 240w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-8-768x960.jpg 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-8-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-8-425x531.jpg 425w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-514671" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Graphic by Steff Staples/PBS News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of when an antibody test may be warranted is if you are a health care provider born before 1957 and you want to make sure you don’t need another dose of the vaccine. You would use a test to see whether you have measles antibodies. But in this case you would be looking for a yes or no answer; the total amount of antibodies may not be very informative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is natural immunity better than vaccine-induced immunity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural immunity – that is, the immunity you get after having measles – is effective. However, the downside is that natural infection with a wild virus is very risky. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;Before 1963, measles caused&lt;/a&gt; close to 50,000 hospitalizations and about 500 deaths each year in the United States, usually in children. It also caused over 1,000 cases of severe brain inflammation every year and carried several other long-term risks, such as permanent hearing loss or the wipe out of immunity to other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/what-to-know-about-highly-contagious-measles-and-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; What to know about highly contagious measles and how to protect yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of vaccines is to create immunity without the risks of severe infection. It is basically a dress rehearsal for the real thing. The immunity from a vaccine is effectively the same immunity you get from having measles itself – but vastly safer than encountering the wild virus unprotected. One dose is 93 percent effective at preventing measles and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html"&gt;two doses are 97 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;, and any breakthrough cases are likely to be much milder than a full-blown case of measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can the vaccine cause measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the measles vaccine cannot cause measles because it contains a significantly weakened strain that has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2017.0143"&gt;limited ability to infect and damage cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have claimed without evidence that the current &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/texas-measles-outbreak-anti-vaccine-advocates-blame-shot-rcna193478"&gt;outbreak in Texas was caused by the measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/measles-cases-are-rising-in-the-u-s-heres-why-misinformation-about-the-vaccine-persists-today"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Measles cases are rising in the U.S. Here’s why misinformation about the vaccine persists today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the outbreak investigation, however, CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services analyzed the genome of the virus causing the current outbreak and identified it as a wild measles virus. Researchers classify measles virus strains &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/genetic-analysis.html"&gt;based on their genetic characteristics, or genotypes&lt;/a&gt;. They identified &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812"&gt;the outbreak virus as wild type genotype D8&lt;/a&gt;, and not the weakened measles vaccine strain, which is genotype A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZx28D6I8aI?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Measles vaccination has worked so well that many people today have never seen a measles case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the risks of the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a very reasonable question. Because the measles vaccine is a live, weakened virus strain, it can cause a mild, measles-like syndrome. For example, some people might have a slight fever, a rash, or some slight joint pain. These symptoms generally go away in a day or two, and most people don’t experience them. But the vaccine cannot cause measles itself, as it does not contain the wild measles virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In extremely rare cases, people can experience &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6204a1.htm"&gt;more significant reactions to the measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. It is important to remember that every single medical or health intervention carries risks – and that includes all medications and over-the-counter supplements. According to all available evidence, however, comparing the potential benefits against potential risks reveals that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html"&gt;the risks of a signficant reaction&lt;/a&gt; to the vaccine are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub4"&gt;much lower than the risks of severe outcomes from measles&lt;/a&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being vaccinated not only protects you and your family, but it also &lt;a href="https://vaccineknowledge.ox.ac.uk/herd-immunity#How-does-herd-immunity-work"&gt;protects vulnerable people in the community&lt;/a&gt;, such as infants, cancer patients and pregnant women, who cannot be vaccinated themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

Those smoking fentanyl, however, have been able to get them for free, at taxpayers’ expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There was also the time five years ago, when the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/san-francisco-supervisor-drug-overdose-billboard-sends-wrong-message" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;city helped pay for a billboard&lt;/a&gt; that showed smiling, glittery partygoers. “Do it with friends,” the public service message said, urging drug users to consume with others so they could treat a potential overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;For decades, San Francisco has been a liberal city where those using drugs found easy access to their substance of choice and a government generally willing to tolerate addiction. City leaders emphasized a harm reduction approach, believing that more lives would be saved by helping users to consume safely than by punishing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/daniel-lurie-san-francisco-mayor.html?searchResultPosition=1" title=""&gt;Daniel Lurie&lt;/a&gt;, the moderate Democrat who became the city’s new mayor in January, said this week that things had gone too far. He told The New York Times that he would announce on Wednesday a new policy that walks back the free distribution of clean foil, pipes and plastic straws on the streets of San Francisco.

12:30 p.m. Exposed individuals should monitor for symptoms April 7-21.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease, causing fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. If one person contracts measles, up to nine out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The disease mainly spreads through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People infected with measles are contagious four days before the rash starts through four days after the rash appears. The incubation period for measles from exposure to fever is usually about seven to 10 days, and from exposure to rash onset is usually about 10-14 days (with a range of seven to 21 days.) People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash. Measles can lead to ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and in rare cases, encephalitis (brain inflammation) or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy people can experience complications from measles, but those at highest risk include infants and children under five years, adults over 20 years, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccination offers safe, effective measles protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent measles, Providence Swedish strongly recommends everyone receive the safe and highly effective MMR vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles and providing long-lasting protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information can be found on the Snohomish County Health Department's &lt;a href="https://www.snohd.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=841" target="_blank" title="https://www.snohd.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=841" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;WEBSITE. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 19:02:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgJBVV95cUxOclI0NUhVU2oxLTJ3c0dqZnlTTXFQRkphV2hLTXlDNXB0RWZqa0RST1FwQnc1eTFIcWFFcXNYQ3VMWXNKNW5IME1hdDltWEZjakhkdnpmMy1uRFFBX0xLMHYwRy1CY2IwYlIxQWNselRMVzdRejB5YlNJUktqSk9XTDRvSi1yT3FkRlJaYUsyVFNPcTZxYW5mQnhTYk83QWE1Xzl5Q3BUNTJwRTFueHNhQy1BU2djV0s5OTV4WW1MaUFWcHB0Mjl1TWxOLThqaDBpRGFOa3JmZlFUUXB5c0JCUDRkWmdmenJ5Z2VlelVrNHlQMDN6dUJhRGZyREFQZ1U4dzJvSEZUU0ItMkxzc2JrdzBocEJ5dlFjMndlQ09ISWxZVl9fVkliOE1kblBSdS1NdWoxVUhnbHYxVDYzT0E</guid></item><item><title>Psychologists reveal how to FORCE narcissists to tell the truth - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxOR0s2RGNaUlViX1VrNEdacHA0cWo4UDRib1ZHc0ZhOE9HQVRySVF5ZmRPS0ZhV2FpaWdDYzlNQ25icWJOeGNnQmJqZWFMbFFPbUQtZGxLZzZNWHcyQklXWUU0V3Q3cUhzaFVsU3V1d3BfZkp1SlR1TUtMUHY2cU54RDJ0RDZWQVJmZHZzTERWSlltT01zUGs5X2NjM1NwSFNFczhmU3RwWnRiZ3hmbmfSAbMBQVVfeXFMTkhlVGxTekFwS0JMVG5FQlpmYkVDczZ1QUZDalJ2TWpjcFJsS3F1ZkpHQWcxRFlGOENjZWVzanBfZVZVdmwxbDZjVTltam54bmNqVUpjTmcyOGJVdUEydlR1TnhCSlBYaXVrYTh3NGhrQmJDdzB5YjlGWkhoeGNTcTBOUmdacGxVRFQxZ0owakJxT3FzY0VtTThJcjZ1RHBaN2xiRElDbUhTaGN3Qkw3b3lIZVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

A recent surge in cases of the bacterial infection, usually spread by sexual contact, has alarmed her and other physicians across Hampton Roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As cases have climbed in all demographics locally and across Virginia and the country — even in newborns and seniors — a regional collaboration called the Stop Syphilis Coalition is launching a public awareness campaign this month to educate residents and providers on risk factors, symptoms and screening recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our region has some of the highest rates of syphilis in Virginia,” Girois said. “This needs to be at the top of people’s minds, because it can be such a devastating and even deadly infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-aGsPBxFR" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_aGsPBxFR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by the Virginia Department of Health and the M.

(Kendall Warner / The Virginian-Pilot)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top goals include promoting screening for all pregnant women — who can pass an infection to their baby, increasing conversations between physicians and patients on prevention and testing options, expanding screening in emergency rooms and outpatient settings, and strengthening data tracking and contact tracing methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of pregnancy, current federal health guidelines call for screening at-risk, sexually-active teenagers and adults, especially if they are between the ages of 15 and 44 and live in areas with high rates of syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have multiple sexual partners, gay or bisexual men, and patients with HIV or another sexually-transmitted infection are among the groups in high-risk categories; having unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex further raises the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left untreated, syphilis can lead to serious and even life-threatening damage to the brain, spinal cord, heart, liver, blood vessels, joints, eyes and ears. An infection in unborn babies, known as congenital syphilis, also increases the odds of premature birth and stillbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In older patients, syphilis typically starts as a single sore on the genitals, rectum or mouth that is firm yet painless. The infection spreads mainly through direct contact with those lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The word ‘sore’ is misleading, unfortunately, as these lesions generally don’t hurt,” said Dr. Charles Frazier, senior vice president and chief medical information and innovation officer at Riverside Health System. “People might ignore them or not even be aware of them, but they need to get checked as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that syphilis is 100% treatable with penicillin. Most adult patients are cured with just one injection of the antibiotic; others may need two or three if the disease has progressed to a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have had unprotected sex with an infected partner, or who don’t know a partner’s history, also may be candidates for doxycycline, an antibiotic that can be taken as a “morning after” treatment to potentially stop syphilis from developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most newborns with congenital syphilis, however, must spend 10 days on intravenous penicillin in intensive care. Without quick treatment, complications can include rashes, fever, anemia, bone changes, developmental delays, swelling in the spleen and liver and hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every case of congenital syphilis is a preventable tragedy,” Girois noted. “Our message is that if you’re pregnant, please, please seek prenatal care.” Obstetricians generally screen expectant mothers at their first appointment and again at 28 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syphilis cases have been climbing steadily in Virginia in recent years, with Hampton Roads a frequent hot spot — particularly for congenital syphilis. In 2024, the Eastern Virginia Health Region accounted for 15 of the state’s 36 congenital cases, according to VDH data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials aren’t sure what’s behind the rise, although a higher number of infected patients naturally leads to more widespread transmission. Girois also theorizes that the intense fear of STIs that drove safe sex practices at the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has subsided as fewer patients die of that infection; more adults, meanwhile, are continuing to date into their senior years, when they don’t need protection to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syphilis is a complex infection with four stages. Most patients first develop a lesion about three weeks after infection. Next, they may experience a rash that can start on the trunk of the body and spread to the limbs, palms of the hands or soles of the feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untreated patients then enter a “latent” phase, when bacteria remain in their bodies but may not cause symptoms for months or years. Those who progress to a final stage, tertiary syphilis, can face dementia, paralysis, balance problems, heart failure and vision and/or hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stop Syphilis Coalition plans to conduct a widespread print and social media education campaign and provide fact sheets to community-based providers and organizations who encounter at-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members also are discussing changing strategies within health care systems. Riverside, for example, has built educational links on syphilis into its electronic medical records system, easily accessed by its community-based providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_7515399" class="wp-caption alignright size-article_inline_third"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.dailypress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-02-120431.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Dr. Lawrence Leslie, deputy medical director for the Emergency Department at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital.

(Courtesy of Sentara Health)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Sentara, emergency department leaders are developing stronger protocols to ensure prompt screening of at-risk patients such as those with HIV, gonorrhea and/or chlamydia, all STIs. That could involve offering more onsite tests along with referrals to outpatient providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to develop the most streamlined pathway to get people into the right setting for education, follow-up testing and treatment,” said Dr. Lawrence Leslie, deputy medical director for the Emergency Department at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital. “Hopefully this is an area where we can make an immediate impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, screening soon could become easier with new rapid blood tests, which can deliver results about 15 minutes after a finger prick. Previously, samples have gone to a laboratory with about a two-day turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to treat people before they walk out the door would be a gamechanger,” Girois said. “It’s time for us to be much more systematic about offering testing. It’s time for a full-court press.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For information, data and resources on syphilis for both the general public and medical providers, visit &lt;a href="http://vdh.virginia.gov/norfolk/syphilis-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vdh.virginia.gov/norfolk/syphilis-resources&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://vdh.virginia.gov/syphilis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vdh.virginia.gov/syphilis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alison Johnson, ajohnsondp@yahoo.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pascal Geldsetzer, at Stanford University, said: “For the first time we are able to say much more confidently that the shingles vaccine causes a reduction in dementia risk. If this truly is a causal effect, we have a finding that’s of tremendous importance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers took advantage of a vaccination rollout that took place in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; more than a decade ago. Public health policy dictated that from 1 September 2013, people born on or after 2 September 1933 became eligible for the Zostavax shot, while those who were older missed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The policy created a natural experiment where the older population was sharply divided into two groups depending on their access to the vaccine. This allowed the researchers to compare dementia rates in older people born weeks apart but on either side of the vaccine eligibility divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After accounting for the fact that not all those eligible for the vaccine received it, the researchers found vaccination led to a 20% reduction in dementia risk, with the strongest effect in women. Anupam Jena, a professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School, said the implications were profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dementia affects more than 55 million people globally and is the leading cause of death in the UK. One in three will develop the condition in their lifetime, and while drugs that slow the disease have recently been approved, there is no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When people contract chickenpox the virus remains dormant in their nerve cells for life. But the virus can reactivate and cause shingles in older people whose immune systems are waning, or in individuals with weakened immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The latest work, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in Nature&lt;/a&gt;, is not the first hint that shingles vaccines might shield against dementia. When Zostavax was rolled out in the US in 2006, several studies found lower rates of dementia in people who received the shots. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/25/shingles-vaccine-shingrix-may-delay-dementia-onset-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Oxford researchers reported an even stronger protective effect&lt;/a&gt; in people who received Shingrix, a newer vaccine. Geldsetzer is now looking for philanthropic and private foundations to fund a randomised clinical trial to confirm any benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is unclear how shingles vaccines might protect against dementia, but one theory is that they reduce inflammation in the nervous system by preventing reactivation of the virus. Another theory is that the vaccines induce broader changes in the immune system that are protective. These wider effects are seen more often in women, potentially explaining the sex differences in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an accompanying article, Jena wrote: “Although it is still unclear precisely how herpes zoster vaccination lowers the risk of dementia, the implications of the study are profound. The vaccine could represent a cost-effective intervention that has public-health benefits strongly exceeding its intended purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Julia Dudley, the head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said the study strengthened the emerging link between shingles vaccination and reduced dementia risk. “While previous studies suggested an association, this research offers stronger evidence of a direct link, with greater benefit observed in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s unclear exactly how the shingles vaccine might influence dementia risk. It may reduce inflammation, support the immune system in ways that protect the brain or involve other mechanisms. It’s important to note that this study looked at the Zostavax vaccine rather than Shingrix, which is now more commonly used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Understanding this link better, including the reason for any differences between men and women, could open new avenues for dementia prevention and treatment,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maxime Taquet, whose Oxford study found a reduced dementia risk after Shingrix vaccination, said adjuvants in that vaccine, which make the immune response more potent, may play a role. Both studies “provide strong support for the hypothesis that shingles vaccination reduces dementia risk, with the newer recombinant vaccine offering superior protection,” he said. “A key question is whether this enhanced protection is due to improved shingles prevention or the adjuvant’s immunological effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPVy1mZ254YmZWSWFnekZEbVFONTJjQWV2UzVZTUE2ZGJRU3dUTWNiME9Hc0FmNGZTTzlTNmVta0pzeXVvSTJIcjlrcXJFb1N1NGdQQTgwVDZ4M3Qwam9LU3dMS3RkcTZ1VlMwX0FJcVR2UHg3RlhEdC02aUIyUFdkQ3NTLUUtS0h1enFxY0M1MlFkUm93NDExU3lyb2ZJN25HYWdISDJ3dWdFaDIwbmlmR0tmX0JyRXB4ZWVfeUg1RUNReEc4Wm1Z</guid></item><item><title>World’s smallest pacemaker is the size of a grain of rice - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPQ1NlanNUYjIwdG1ZbFdSVl8yZVEyc3RsMGl3eFFCM3g5YmhVSFk4c2pGdk5CeEpCVUtUSzFWSDd6NmNtTURnSnFvTU9HV2JNQ1h1NDZPSmJmWWFsTm5mYXRIR1g0SDc3UjF0LTQ2ekN2RVFkVHJEa1JhV2JSYnNJQ0E5aw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A dissolvable &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/pacemaker-primary-battery-research/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pacemaker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pacemaker&lt;/a&gt; that’s smaller than a grain of rice and &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/bacteria-powered-solar-panels/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:powered by light;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;powered by light&lt;/a&gt; could become an invaluable tool for saving the lives of newborn infants., The device can be implanted noninvasively via syringe, and may also be useful for adult patients dealing with certain heart defects. The medical breakthrough is detailed in a study published April 2 in &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08726-4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Roughly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-defects/data/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one percent of infants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;one percent of infants&lt;/a&gt; are born with heart defects every year. The majority of these cases only require a temporary implant for about seven days to allow time for the heart to naturally self-repair. But for low-resource regions of the world lacking access to advanced medical care, what should be a simple procedure can often end in tragedy. Meanwhile, the current standard for temporary pacemakers in adults also presents difficulties. Most procedures involve surgeons sewing electrodes directly onto the heart, then attaching those electrodes to an external pacing box using wires that exit a patient’s chest. Doctors remove the electrodes once they are no longer needed, but post-surgery risks include infection, damaged tissue, dislodgment, and blood clots. The wires sometimes also become encased in scar tissue, presenting further complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That’s actually how Neil Armstrong died. He had a temporary pacemaker after a bypass surgery. When the wires were removed, he experienced internal bleeding,” experimental cardiologist and study co-lead Igor Efimov explained in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2021, a Northwestern University team including Efimov unveiled a &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2021/06/first-ever-transient-pacemaker-harmlessly-dissolves-in-body/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:quarter-sized, biodegradable temporary pacemaker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;quarter-sized, biodegradable temporary pacemaker&lt;/a&gt; without cumbersome batteries, rigid components, or wiring. The device relies on near-field communication protocols similar to those used in RFID tags and smartphones to complete electronic payments. For this to work, however, the pacemaker needed to include a built-in antenna to relay radio frequency commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the wearable device (left) detects an irregular heartbeat, it emits light to activate the pacemaker. These short pulses—which penetrate through the patient’s skin, breastbone and muscles—control the pacing. Credit: John Rogers / Northwestern University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our original pacemaker worked well. It was thin, flexible and fully resorbable. But the size of its receiver antenna limited our ability to miniaturize it,” said its co-creator and bioelectronics pioneer John Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rogers, Efimov, and collaborators spent the next few years researching ways to shrink their temporary pacemaker to even smaller proportions. They eventually realized they could swap out the radio antenna for a design that instead relies on light-based data transmission. They also replaced the original device’s near-field communication power source with a galvanic cell—a type of battery that converts chemical energy into electrical energy. In the new version, the pacemaker relies on two metal electrodes that generate an electrical current after interacting with surrounding biofluids. This current is then directed to stimulate and regulate the heart through a miniscule, infrared light-activated switch installed on the battery’s opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right: Traditional pacemaker, leadless pacemaker, and new bioresorbable pacemaker. Credit: John Rogers / Northwestern University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Infrared light penetrates very well through the body,” said Efimov. “If you put a flashlight against your palm, you will see the light glow through the other side of your hand. It turns out that our bodies are great conductors of light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because the human heart requires only a small amount of electrical stimulation, researchers were able to shrink their next-generation pacemaker even smaller. The final result is a 1-millimeter-thick device measuring just 1.8 mm wide and 3.5 mm long that is still capable of delivering as much electrical stimulation as a standard pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We have developed what is, to our knowledge, the world’s smallest pacemaker,” Rogers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Given its materials safely dissolve over time, the pacemaker also doesn’t require any follow-up invasive surgery to remove it. This dramatically cuts down on the potential for post-op complications and trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But why stop at just one miniature pacemaker? Efimov, Rogers, and collaborators believe that further advancements could allow the deployment of multiple devices across the heart. Once implanted, designers could coordinate them to move independently or together based on specific light wavelengths. This could lead to more complex synchronization therapies, including those that treat arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We also could incorporate our pacemakers into other medical devices like heart valve replacements, which can cause heart block,” suggested Efimov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The device’s size also means it can be incorporated into other implantable tools such as transcatheter aortic valve replacements, pain inhibitors, as well as nerve and bone restoration techniques. These future possibilities, however, all trace back to the team’s original goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our major motivation was children,” said Efimov. “Now, we can place this tiny pacemaker on a child’s heart and stimulate it with a soft, gentle, wearable device.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPQ1NlanNUYjIwdG1ZbFdSVl8yZVEyc3RsMGl3eFFCM3g5YmhVSFk4c2pGdk5CeEpCVUtUSzFWSDd6NmNtTURnSnFvTU9HV2JNQ1h1NDZPSmJmWWFsTm5mYXRIR1g0SDc3UjF0LTQ2ekN2RVFkVHJEa1JhV2JSYnNJQ0E5aw</guid></item><item><title>Hospital's flippant response after TEN of its maternity nurses working in same ward develop brain tumors - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPelBZdmtCT0xnZFE1OGxzZmV1ekRBZkl3M1hDSzZMYVR3bFIzTkxXNkttb1RfVU1yd0hZd2ZldmZyUjhvRHdTaGZNblpIOHBXTXBpUTVGenVZdkcxQ2cwb21jWlVtS3lrTTNSRk9JbVRKYUtIV3FPb2ExTmJVNGRoQ2FDRnFBQnZlOXV1aVlYRlhKNVRnQVFYY2VwUG9PaVnSAaQBQVVfeXFMT1o2TEJrZHFCcnRsbnZ3ZC14QWhNSEg4allaeEhWQUJOelplMkYtaUdVSE04SDh6T0prWFdxTUtLNGxsU05fNHFOc3IzZnctVWNfZl9QLUdCd20tZGRLODJZV292ejFFZHBvMEpDUjhEY3Q5TFpVYmU2bnFqTnd3VW1FMTc3djFoMk5TMm5yUVo5U2hhUkFHTjNqcUFzOEhHdW5QdVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-f6b8b740-0fc5-11f0-b66b-b9d57686ea57"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; maternity ward has seen a spike in nurses diagnosed with brain tumors - as staff fear conditions are making them sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Workers at Newton-Wellesley Hospital have been struck with different types of brain tumors over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One claimed as many as ten nurses on the same floor - including herself - had been diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some have been benign and some cancerous, she believed that the diagnoses were serious cause for concern for the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nurse told &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/newton-wellesley-hospital-nurses-brain-cancer-cases/"&gt;WBZ-TV&lt;/a&gt;: 'It's getting to the point where the number just increases, and you start saying am I crazy thinking this. This can't just be a coincidence.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the outlet three of them have had surgery, but believed the hospital has not been supportive enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We want reassurance because this has not been a reassuring past few months for a lot of the staff members,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We want to feel safe, the same way we want to make our patients feel safe.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One Newton-Wellesley Hospital nurse claimed that as many as ten nurses on the same floor, including herself, received a brain tumor diagnosis. This can't just be a coincidence,' she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The hospital claimed that there were 'no environmental risk' after conducting an investigation since December&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerns had been growing in the department among nurses, as the number of their colleagues struck with the diagnosis only increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You're going into work every day with that feeling in your gut, and it's a lousy feeling,' she told the outlet.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hospital, however, gave a shocking response claiming there were 'no environmental risk' after investigating since December. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a statement the hospital said: 'After we became aware of reported brain tumors in individuals who currently or previously had worked in the same area of the hospital, we conducted an extensive investigation in collaboration with the Department of Occupational Health and Safety, Newton-Wellesley Safety Officer, radiation and pharmaceutical safety offices, and external environmental consultants.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hospital told the outlet it had interviewed ten nurses, five of which were said to have different types of brain tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Every staff member who came forward was given the opportunity to be interview by the Occupational Health and Safety team to evaluate each diagnosis in the context of their individual medical history and risk factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To evaluate for any possible environmental exposures in that area of the hospital, comprehensive environmental assessments following CDC guidelines began in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The investigation found no environmental risks which could be linked to the development of a brain tumor. We presented these findings to relevant stakeholder groups, including the staff on the unit and the Massachusetts Nursing Association, and have held forums to meet with clinical and Occupational Health leaders to answer their questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'You're going into work every day with that feeling in your gut, and it's a lousy feeling,' the nurse said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sandy Muse (pictured), the Chief Nursing Officer, signed the hospital statement which said it can 'confidently reassure' the nurses there was no environmental risk at the facility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The hospital is proving the MNA with the test results from the investigation, including those of several external environmental firms,' the statement continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Based on these results, we can confidently reassure our dedicated team members at mass General Brigham/Newton-Wellesley Hospital and all our patients that there is no environmental risk at our facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As always, the health and wellbeing of our staff, clinicians, and patients is our absolute top priority.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The statement was given by Jonathon Sonis, the Associate Chief Medical Officer and Vice President of Medical Affairs, and Sandy Muse, the Chief Nursing Officer and Senior Vice President of Patient Care Services.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet despite the investigation, as worries persist, the nurses are calling for an independent investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paula Ward of the Massachusetts Nurse Association told the outlet:' I think the concern is [that] we don't know what it is, and nurses are scared, they're worried, and they want to make sure they're not working in an unsafe place.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think the nurses should be the first people - because we're the ones that brought it to their attention - to be told, and we feel like we have been the last to be informed on anything,' the anonymous nurse added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson for Newton-Wellesley Hospital confirmed that not all of the nurses were on the unit at the same time and noted that some of the diagnoses pre-date the Covid-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Autism diagnosis often misses girls, with up to 80% receiving incorrect diagnoses first, research suggests.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Diagnostic criteria developed based on male symptoms often overlook girls, brain imaging expert Gina Rippon says.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Girls with autism often internalize problems and mask their difficulties, unlike boys who act out.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Nearly 70% of autism studies tested only men or included very few women, according to a 2024 review.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Sensory sensitivity, recently added to diagnostic criteria, may help identify autism in girls.&lt;/li&gt;

            Researchers historically have viewed autism as a distinctly “male” &lt;a href="https://aane.org/autism-info-faqs/library/autism-adhd/" target="_blank"&gt;neurotype&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            But why? Is it because they only paid attention to symptoms in boys, and girls haven’t been screened properly? Boys are 10 times more likely than girls to be referred for autism assessments, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8604819/" target="_blank"&gt;a 2020 review&lt;/a&gt; showed, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10813290/" target="_blank"&gt;a 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; suggests that up to 80% of girls and women may receive a diagnosis of social anxiety, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/27/health/what-is-an-eating-disorder-wellness/index.html"&gt;eating disorder&lt;/a&gt; or borderline personality disorder before being accurately diagnosed as autistic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            These biases and shortcomings are the subject of “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Off-Spectrum-Science-Autism-Failed/dp/1541605020" target="_blank"&gt;Off the Spectrum&lt;/a&gt;: Why the Science of Autism Has Failed Women and Girls,” a new book by brain imaging expert Gina Rippon.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Rippon, professor emeritus of cognitive neuroimaging at the Aston Brain Centre in Birmingham, England, investigates how and why scientists and clinicians have systematically underestimated and overlooked autism in women and girls.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylpzn2000h356md00tm0st@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00621-3" target="_blank"&gt;In a 2024 review,&lt;/a&gt; Rippon found of the more than 120 studies testing brain models of autism that she examined, nearly 70% of the studies only tested men or included very few women. She noted that less than 10% of the 4,000 participants in those studies were women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylpzn2000i356m9l9d9b6b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rippon said she was startled to discover the extent to which she and her colleagues had fundamentally misunderstood the nature of autism in girls and women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylpzn2000j356mul617z40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CNN recently talked with Rippon about autism in girls and women, the challenges of current diagnostics, and how medical professionals can think differently about screening without bias.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylpzn2000k356mmrg2qd8o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What inspired you to investigate autism in girls?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8yiufb80000356m1ph0m8rq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Gina Rippon: &lt;/strong&gt;There was this very strong belief up until recently that autism was a male problem. As a result, a big industry grew around autism diagnosis to reliably indicate whether a child had autism. But they were only looking at the kind of behavior that was characteristic of boys. If girls came along with similarly disordered behavior, the idea that it might be autism just didn’t emerge.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9000y356m97lx9c95@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were so-called “gold-standard” tests, but because the tests were based on boys, girls would be screened out. For a neuroscientist like me who wanted to look at autism in females, I wouldn’t be able to find any females who had been diagnosed as autistic. It got embedded in our consciousness, “OK, this is a male problem, so we probably better just look at males.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9000z356m9n8almm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How did the system get so biased?&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; I like to say the diagnostic dice were loaded from the start. There is no biomarker for autism — there’s not a handy X-ray or some physical test we can use to diagnose autism. Instead, there are a huge array of different behaviors which, over the years, have (been) identified as characteristic of autistic children. (But) it’s all based on what it looks like in boys.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90011356m0lr1ek3n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://magazine.smhs.gwu.edu/news/observation-autism" target="_blank"&gt;Kevin Pelphrey&lt;/a&gt;, one of the top autism researchers in the world, has two autistic children — one girl, one boy. His wife describes how difficult it was for them to get their daughter diagnosed. You would think they would know what they were talking about, yet their daughter’s diagnosis was dismissed across the board. Experts would say, “She’s shy, she’ll grow out of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90012356m2j3et83j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why is it so difficult for experts to identify autism in girls?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90013356m44dtlixs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s the classic confirmation bias, which is the tendency to interpret new evidence as a confirmation of one’s existing beliefs.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90014356mxb113y65@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers have presented identical hypothetical scenarios to teachers, saying, “This child presents with these kinds of issues in the classroom, so do you think this child might be autistic? Do you think this child might need special support?” Teachers are much more likely to say yes to the notion that the child was autistic and needed support if the child was named Jack than if the child was named Chloe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90015356mbspnqj6h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Behavioral differences in autistic children emerge early on. Those are times when teachers who have broad experience of a much wider range of children should be able to say, “This kind of behavior is unusual. I think we should take it further.” Instead, if behaviors are unusual and it’s a boy, it’s autism, but if behaviors are unusual and it’s a girl, she’s shy, socially anxious, and people might say, “she’ll grow out of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90016356m8nngf1al@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Secondly, autism presents differently in girls versus boys. Girls who are distressed in some way very often internalize their problems. They become withdrawn and shy, stand in the corner, don’t engage with other children. If you’ve got children who are shy and quiet and stand quietly in the corner, you aren’t going to think there’s a problem and maybe you’ll even move on. If you’ve got children who are acting out by banging their heads against a desk or kicking, which is more characteristic of boys, those are the kids you’re going to look at more closely.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90017356mfpl6bagv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The third layer is that there is clear evidence that girls try to camouflage or disguise or mask their problems. That happens very early on, at age 4 or 5. If you find the right way of asking them questions, they will say, “Other people in the class think I’m weird. I try and find out why they think I’m weird, and I try and behave not weird.” I call these kids chameleons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90018356mjkrgnv62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is nothing new. In the 1980s, a researcher named &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4495836/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Lorna Wing&lt;/a&gt;, who was partially responsible for broadening the notion of autism, said, “Maybe girls are just better at disguising their problems,” and “Maybe girls are taught to behave better earlier on.” It’s not socially acceptable for girls to act out, so they don’t.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What can a diagnosis mean to a young woman who has been struggling?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001a356muiex9q2k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; All the women I spoke to said their first and most powerful reaction on getting a diagnosis of autism was a sense of relief, because it suddenly made so much sense of their lives. For older women, it was very often then a sense of regret, how different their lives would’ve been if they’d known.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001b356m4ngf1h6w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Particularly the girls who are so desperate to belong, what struck me is how much at odds this is from the view of autism as an aloofness — as if autistic individuals aren’t interested in social contact. With autistic females, it’s almost the reverse. They’re desperate for social contact, but they lack what you might call social instinct, knowing how to behave in social situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001c356ms4odt6c9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the girls I talked to for my book told me it’s a bit like how people who are deaf from birth wouldn’t understand that there’s this kind of invisible something that is the sound of words, which people use to communicate with each other. Autistic girls could be described as deaf to the language of social behavior, so they don’t understand how you stand properly or maintain eye contact, or that you aren’t supposed to go on about your favorite subject for an hour. For these girls, a diagnosis can be very freeing and validating.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How can experts learn to diagnose girls at a younger age?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001e356m2h8u6pp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon&lt;/strong&gt;: One thing that has struck me is that the notion of hypersensitivity to sensory issues such as scratchy clothes, bright lights, smells and so on, is more characteristic of girls on the spectrum than boys. And that’s only just come into the diagnosis. It was in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(DSM-5-TR).&lt;br&gt;Although sensory issues have been very characteristic of autism as a whole — and very often there are reports of autistic children hating loud noises or bright lights or whatever — it wasn’t a diagnostic characteristic until quite recently. Having this in the diagnostic criteria might help.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001f356mbxdwnpfu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Raising awareness and accepting that autistic children of both sexes should be allowed special accommodations at school, such as taking tests in a separate room or wearing headphones. That’s very important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001g356m5hyuf7vu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For autistic girls like chameleons, who might be hypersensitive to what they perceive as social rejection, it’s also important to teach kindness to all children. Some of the saddest interviews I had were the ones with young girls who were hyperaware that people thought they were weird and odd.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001h356mp9vm3hxi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not a fan of pharmaceutical solutions for young children, partly because it is a time at which our brains are hugely plastic. At the same time, sleep disturbances and gastrointestinal disorders are characteristic among autistic kids, and if left untreated these (issues) can interfere with social activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001j356mladu2wlr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s also a lot about autism you can’t treat. A lot of the behavioral difficulties that autistic individuals have are side effects of their autism; they get hugely anxious because they don’t know how to deal with social situations, not because they need anxiety medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s critical for researchers to speak to autistic people and ask, “What is it like to be you?” That perspective is invaluable. There’s a big movement for what is called inclusivity or participatory research, where autistic people become part of the research team.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm900gurg00033b6mq3eol5p5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;They advise what kind of questions to ask, they advise how you might interpret the answers you’re getting. There’s a video I recommend called “Here Come the Girls,” and in it, autistic women basically say, “We are autistic, and this is what it’s like for us.” I think that inclusivity is the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; Autism doesn’t only affect boys; girls can be autistic, too. The world has not accommodated autistic girls until the last decade or so. Thankfully, that’s changing. Here come the girls.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multidisciplinary team led by the University of Liège has proposed a unified neuroscientific model explaining the mechanisms behind near-death experiences (NDEs), drawing on converging empirical findings across neurobiology, psychology, and evolutionary theory.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Findings suggest that factors such as oxygen deprivation, increased carbon dioxide, and disrupted &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+energy+metabolism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain energy metabolism&lt;/a&gt; can initiate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+responses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain responses&lt;/a&gt; that lead to vivid perceptual and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/emotional+experiences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;emotional experiences&lt;/a&gt; often reported during NDEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects reporting NDEs describe a wide range of phenomena, though typically only certain types of experiences are elevated to the level of public interest. Some of the more commonly retold types of NDEs include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out-of-body experiences, where there is a dissociative sense of leaving the physical body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distorted awareness of time, with a sense that time has slowed down, stopped, or accelerated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An emotional sense of calm, peace, and well-being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A flood of memories or having one's life "flash" before their eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bright lights, long tunnels, and visitations by deceased relatives or unknown figures perceived as sentient, mystical, or spiritual imagery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many intriguing NDEs capture the imagination, and selection bias pushes us toward focusing on experiences that appear thematically repetitive. Less retold are NDEs that, though just as vivid, contain nightmarish, mundane, or nonsense themes. Subjective states resembling NDEs can occur in both life-threatening and non-life-threatening situations, such as fainting and drug use.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Scientifically, NDEs are described as episodes of disconnected consciousness that occur in contexts involving actual or perceived physical threats. Reported experiences are highly varied in phenomenology, with content and interpretation shaped by triggering conditions such as the individual's psychological state and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physiological+responses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physiological responses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous theories to explain NDEs have included psychological, neurophysiological, and evolutionary models, typically developed independently of a broader research framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the review article, "A neuroscientific model of near-death experiences," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-025-01072-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Reviews Neurology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a narrative review that draws on human and animal studies, psychedelic neuroscience, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical data&lt;/a&gt; to explain how altered states of awareness can emerge at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No single experimental cohort was analyzed as the authors synthesized data from a range of previously published studies. Animal studies and neuroimaging data from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/critically+ill+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;critically ill patients&lt;/a&gt; provided insight into the physiological breakdown that may initiate NDEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A consistent pattern of physiological disruption emerged during cardiac arrest and other critical events. Reduced cerebral blood flow triggers hypoxia and elevates carbon dioxide levels.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;A cascade of factors then induces cerebral acidosis and depletes ATP, the cell's primary energy source, and produces a surge in neurotransmitter release across multiple brain systems, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, noradrenaline, GABA, acetylcholine, and endorphins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key mechanistic details include elevated serotonin levels and 5-HT2A receptor activation, potentially contributing to visual hallucinations and feelings of hyper-reality. Dopamine release may influence emotional salience. Noradrenaline and acetylcholine appear linked to memory encoding. GABA and endorphins are proposed to induce calming sensations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found parallels between NDEs and psychedelic-induced states, particularly with substances like DMT and ketamine, which affect similar receptor systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological traits such as dissociation proneness and REM sleep intrusion tendencies may predispose individuals to experiencing NDEs under stress. Findings also suggest that NDEs and death-feigning behaviors (thanatosis) may share evolutionary roots as coping mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the convergence of neurobiological and psychological responses to severe physiological stress, researchers crafted NEPTUNE (Neurophysiological Evolutionary Psychological Theory Understanding Near-death Experience), a model to provide a comprehensive framework integrating diverse lines of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, "Our NEPTUNE model, although theoretical at present, provides a foundation for the next research phase, which will entail empirical testing of each mechanism."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research aims to empirically test aspects of the NEPTUNE model using neuroimaging, physiological monitoring, and continued exploration of brain activity near death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEPTUNE also raises questions about consciousness during critical illness and the potential reevaluation of brain death protocols in light of documented surges in brain activity after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

Using data from two national databases, researchers found consistent results: about 16% of pregnant women developed Long COVID symptoms versus 19% of matched non-pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While pregnancy appears to offer some protection, certain subgroups—such as women with obesity, older maternal age, or who identify as Black—were at higher risk. The findings point to a potential protective role of immune changes during and after pregnancy and highlight the need for more focused Long COVID research in pregnant populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Pregnant women had a lower rate of Long COVID than non-pregnant peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher-Risk Groups:&lt;/strong&gt; Black women, those 35+, and those with metabolic conditions faced higher risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistent Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings held across two national health data networks and different definitions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Weill Cornell University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pregnancy may offer some protection from developing Long COVID, found a new study led by Weill Cornell Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, University of Utah Health and Louisiana Public Health Institute. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has mostly focused on non-pregnant adults affected by Long COVID— a condition lasting for months after a person recovers from SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published April 1 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, helps fill a critical gap about Long COVID in women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108360"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne.jpg" alt="This shows two pregnant women." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Among the pregnant women, the researchers found that certain groups had higher Long COVID risks than others. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This population is so important and vulnerable, but we had no evidence about their Long COVID risk to guide their care,” said Dr. Chengxi Zang, an instructor in population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine, who co-led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this new data will help clinicians develop better Long COVID prevention and treatment strategies for pregnant women and help those most at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digging into Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tapped into real-world data collected in two large electronic health record-based studies, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) and the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), under the National Institutes of Health RECOVER initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They analyzed data on approximately 72,000 women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy between March 2020 and June 2023 and about 208,000 age and demographically matched controls who were not pregnant but developed the infection during this period. They looked for signs of Long COVID 180 days after the women recovered from infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the rates of long-term complications related to COVID-19 are lower among pregnant women than comparably matched women who were not pregnant during their infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were consistent across both large databases and held true even when the researchers used different methods to define Long COVID. This consistency adds confidence to the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the PCORnet cohort&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Zang and his colleagues found that about 16 out of 100 pregnant women developed Long COVID compared with about 19 out of 100 non-pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long COVID is defined as having any of the following symptoms: cognitive problems, encephalopathy, sleep disorders, acute pharyngitis, shortness of breath, pulmonary fibrosis, chest pain, diabetes, edema, malnutrition, joint pain, fever, malaise and fatigue. Similar findings were replicated in the N3C cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Though we observed that pregnant women have a significant risk of Long COVID, it was surprisingly lower than those who were not pregnant when they had SARS-CoV-2 infection,” Dr. Zang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, some subgroups seemed especially vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groups at Higher Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the pregnant women, the researchers found that certain groups had higher Long COVID risks than others. For example, pregnant women who identified as Black, or were of advanced maternal age (age 35 or older at delivery), or had obesity or other metabolic conditions were more likely to develop Long COVID than pregnant women who weren’t part of these groups. However, this risk was still lower than their matched non-pregnant controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further research on factors such as inequitable healthcare access, socioeconomic factors and structural racism may help us understand the elevated Long COVID risk in these groups and find ways to protect them,” said Dr. Zang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hypothesize that the altered immune and inflammatory environment lasting about six weeks after giving birth might contribute to lowering the risk of Long COVID,” Dr. Zang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The observed risk differences in this analysis suggest future dedicated studies of Long COVID in pregnant individuals are needed.” For instance, differences in COVID infection by trimester may be informative for patient counseling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zang and his colleagues at Weill Cornell Medicine are also using electronic health records to study how existing medications may be repurposed to protect pregnant women from Long COVID.               &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was co-led by Dr. Elaine Hill and Dr. Daniel Guth, at the University of Rochester Medical Center; Dr. Torri D.

The observed risk factors for Long COVID included Black race/ethnicity, advanced maternal age, first- and second-trimester infection, obesity, and comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings suggest a high incidence of Long COVID among pregnant individuals, their risk was lower than that of matched non-pregnant females.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:59:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1TNUlPM19iQXQ0Ry1Tc3ZFYVlRdWFBYjMtNUYxT3RNVVAxNjg1bGdKNDk3LWFlaFFSTkxNSWpfTFFPOURrOVMxaFNsd3FqcjVsb3dqcXZQUXhSMnpaZzZicER4c3NmNkR6dVBaR1duczlJal90</guid></item><item><title>Weight Training May Slow Cognitive Decline and Protect Aging Brains - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE5BdE5KRFRIbEhVLVRrLXlMOEhwUUgwS2U3ZHRscWM2djRWRGJYTmUwSExJTldpbXFURXV6TkZYLVdfUXhyM3dFdm90eS1WeXVXOFdkcWlENHhZb0dfNC1WNS13LUN1RnpicjBFTGQ4VGpvcUVfLU1V?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that weight training not only boosts physical strength but also protects the brains of older adults with mild cognitive impairment. After six months of twice-weekly resistance training, participants showed memory improvements and protection against brain atrophy in regions linked to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MRI scans revealed preserved white matter integrity and better brain health, while the control group showed decline. These findings suggest that weight training could be a low-cost, non-pharmacological strategy to slow or even reverse early cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; Weight training preserved hippocampus and precuneus volume in at-risk individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants had better verbal episodic memory after six months of training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-Cost Prevention:&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise offers a cheaper, effective alternative to costly dementia drugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;FAPESP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefits of weight training are many: it promotes gains in strength and muscle mass, reduces body fat, and contributes to well-being and mental health. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now a study carried out at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, has demonstrated another important effect: it protects the brains of older people against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108352"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and an older man weight training." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/weight-training-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In the analyses carried out at the end of the intervention, the volunteers who practiced weight training had better performance in verbal episodic memory, improved integrity of neurons and areas related to Alzheimer’s disease protected from atrophy, while the control group showed a worsening of brain parameters. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 44 people with mild cognitive impairment – an intermediate clinical condition between normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease in which cognitive decline is greater than expected for age, indicating a higher risk of dementia. The results showed that strength training not only improved memory performance but also altered brain anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months of twice-weekly weight training, the participants showed protection against atrophy in the hippocampus and precuneus – brain areas associated with Alzheimer’s disease – as well as improvements in parameters that reflect the health of neurons (white matter integrity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We already knew that there would be physical improvement. Cognitive improvement was also imagined, but we wanted to see the effect of weight training on the brains of older people with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study showed that, fortunately, weight training is a strong ally against dementia, even for people who are already at high risk of developing it,” says Isadora Ribeiro, a FAPESP doctoral fellowship recipient at UNICAMP’s School of Medical Sciences (FCM) and first author of the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was carried out within the framework of the Brazilian Institute for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology (BRAINN) – a FAPESP Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center (RIDC) – and is the first to demonstrate what happens to the integrity of the white matter of individuals with mild cognitive impairment after weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as neuropsychological tests, we also performed MRI scans at the beginning and end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results are very important because they indicate the need to include more physical educators in the public health system at the primary health care level since increased muscle strength is associated with a reduced risk of dementia. It’s a less complex and cheaper treatment that can protect people from serious diseases,” comments Marcio Balthazar, BRAINN researcher and study supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, the new anti-amyloid drugs approved in the United States indicated for the treatment of dementia and for people with mild cognitive impairment, cost around USD 30,000 a year. That’s a very high cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These non-pharmacological measures, as we’ve shown is the case with weight training, are effective, not only in preventing dementia but also in improving mild cognitive impairment,” the researcher adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research participants were divided into two groups: half underwent a resistance exercise program with weight training sessions twice a week, at moderate to high intensity and with progressive loads; the other half did not exercise during the study period and were part of the so-called control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the analyses carried out at the end of the intervention, the volunteers who practiced weight training had better performance in verbal episodic memory, improved integrity of neurons and areas related to Alzheimer’s disease protected from atrophy, while the control group showed a worsening of brain parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A characteristic of people with mild cognitive impairment is that they have volume loss in some brain regions associated with the development of Alzheimer’s. But in the group that did strength training, the right side of the hippocampus and precuneus were protected from atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This result justifies the importance of regular weight training, especially for older people,” Ribeiro highlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researcher believes that a longer period of training could lead to even more positive results than those reported in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All the individuals in the bodybuilding group showed improvements in memory and brain anatomy. However, five of them reached the end of the study without a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, such was their improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This leads us to imagine that longer training sessions, lasting three years, for example, could reverse this diagnosis or delay any kind of dementia progression. It’s certainly something to be hopeful about and something that needs to be studied in the future,” Ribeiro argues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, weight training can protect the brain against dementia on two fronts: by stimulating the production of neural growth factor (an important protein for the growth, maintenance and survival of neurons) and by promoting global disinflammation in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any physical exercise, whether weight training or aerobic activity, is known to increase levels of a chemical involved in brain cell growth. It can also mobilize anti-inflammatory T-cells. This is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After all, the more pro-inflammatory protein that is released in the body, the greater the chance of developing dementia, accelerating the neurodegenerative process and forming dysfunctional proteins that eventually kill neurons,” Balthazar explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess these issues, the volunteers’ levels of irisin and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) – substances whose synthesis is stimulated by muscle contraction and which are associated with neural protection and synaptic plasticity – were measured. The results are currently being analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a continuation of this study in which we’ll try to better understand how these factors are related to changes in brain anatomy. We believe that it’s a set of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective factors that lead to these changes,” Ribeiro predicts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging, exercise, and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c1a9b3a4a8afa4b3b581a7a0b1a4b2b1efa3b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heloisa Reinert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fapesp.br" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FAPESP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Heloisa Reinert – FAPESP&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01483-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Resistance training protects the hippocampus and precuneus against atrophy and benefits white matter integrity in older adults with mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;” by Isadora Ribeiro et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resistance training protects the hippocampus and precuneus against atrophy and benefits white matter integrity in older adults with mild cognitive impairment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to cognitive alterations with preservation of functionality. Individuals with this diagnosis have a higher risk of developing dementia. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical exercise, are beneficial for the cognition of this population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the impact of resistance training (RT) on the brain anatomy of older adults with MCI has not yet been clarified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the effects of RT on cognition and brain anatomy in MCI. Forty-four older adults with MCI, 22 in the training group and 22 in the control group, were evaluated in neuropsychological tests and magnetic resonance imaging at the beginning and end of the study, which lasted 24 weeks. We used repeated measures ANOVA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The training group showed better performance in verbal episodic memory after intervention. The control group showed a decrease in gray matter volume in the hippocampus and precuneus, while the training group showed no reduction in the right hippocampus and precuneus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it showed a decrease in the volume of these regions on the left side and in the left superior frontal gyrus.

Surprisingly, the type of activity—whether social media, movies, or studying—didn’t make a difference; it was the screen time itself that mattered most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe this is due to “time displacement,” where screens delay sleep by taking up rest time. The study suggests turning off screens at least 30–60 minutes before bed to protect sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;59% Insomnia Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; One extra hour of screen time after bedtime raises insomnia odds by 59%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time, Not Type:&lt;/strong&gt; All screen activities disrupt sleep equally, regardless of content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Bedtime screen use shortens nightly sleep by an average of 24 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Frontiers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists have found another reason to put the phone down: a survey of 45,202 young adults in Norway has discovered that using a screen in bed drives up your risk of insomnia up by 59% and cuts your sleep time by 24 minutes. However, social media was not found to be more disruptive than other screen activities. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The type of screen activity does not appear to matter as much as the overall time spent using screens in bed,” said Dr Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, lead author of the article in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108348"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person in bed and a tablet." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/screen-time-sleep-insomnia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The scientists found that increasing screen time after bedtime by one hour increased the odds of insomnia symptoms by 59% and lowered sleep duration by 24 minutes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt; “We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption — likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night night, sleep tight? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is critical to our mental and physical health, but many of us don’t get enough. At the same time, an increasing number of people are accustomed to using screens in bed, which may be associated with poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screen use is thought to impact sleep in four ways: notifications disturb sleep, screen time replaces sleeping time, screen activities keep you wakeful so you take longer to fall asleep, or light exposure delays circadian rhythms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep problems are highly prevalent among students and have significant implications for mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being, but previous studies have primarily focused on adolescents,” said Hjetland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the widespread use of screens in bed we aimed to explore the relationship between different screen activities and sleep patterns. We expected that social media use might be more strongly associated with poorer sleep, given its interactive nature and potential for emotional stimulation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the scientists used the 2022 Students’ Health and Wellbeing survey, a nationally representative study of Norwegian students. They reached 45,202 participants in full-time higher education, aged between 18-28 years old.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They first asked participants to say whether they used screens after going to bed and for how long. Then they asked participants to identify their chosen activities: watching shows or movies, gaming, social media, surfing the internet, listening to audio like podcasts, or reading study-related materials.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were also asked to report their bedtime and rising time, as well as how long it took them to fall asleep, how often they had trouble falling or staying asleep, how often they felt sleepy during the day, and how long their sleep problems persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insomnia was defined as trouble sleeping and daytime sleepiness issues at least three times a week over at least three months.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then sorted responses into three categories: one where participants said they only used social media, one where participants did not mention social media, and one where participants selected several activities, including social media.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-nighters &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that increasing screen time after bedtime by one hour increased the odds of insomnia symptoms by 59% and lowered sleep duration by 24 minutes. However, using social media wasn’t more detrimental than other screen activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no significant interaction between the time spent using a screen and the choice of activity, suggesting that the activity itself didn’t affect the amount of time people stayed awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This indicates that screens reduce sleep time because they displace rest, not because they increase wakefulness: different activities would be expected to affect wakefulness differently.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you struggle with sleep and suspect that screen time may be a factor, try to reduce screen use in bed, ideally stopping at least 30–60 minutes before sleep,” suggested Hjetland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you do use screens, consider disabling notifications to minimize disruptions during the night.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists cautioned, however, that their study focuses on a single culture. There could be notable differences in the relationship between screen use and sleep globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, to compare social media use with other screen activities, some activities which could have different effects on sleep — such as listening to music or gaming — were included in a single category.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study cannot determine causality — for example, whether screen use causes insomnia or if students with insomnia use screens more,” noted Hjetland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study also did not include physiological assessments, which could provide more precise insights into sleep patterns.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f68684938585b690849998829f9384859f98d8998491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Angharad Brewer Gillham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://frontiersin.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Angharad Brewer Gillham – Frontiers&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1548273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;How and when screens are used: Comparing different screen activities and sleep in Norwegian university students&lt;/a&gt;” by Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland et al. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How and when screens are used: Comparing different screen activities and sleep in Norwegian university students&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Screen use in bed has become a widespread habit, particularly among young people. This behavior has been associated with poor sleep, with some studies indicating that social media use may be especially detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is a scarcity of research directly comparing the relationship between various screen activities and sleep, and most existing studies focus on adolescents rather than young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aims to explore the relationship between screen use in bed and sleep among students, specifically comparing social media use to other screen-based activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; This study utilized data from the cross-sectional Students’ Health and Wellbeing Study of 2022 and included n=45,202 participants aged 18-28 years. Regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between screen time in bed and sleep, comparing social media use with other activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; A one-hour increase of screen time after going to bed was associated with 59% higher odds of having symptoms of insomnia and a reduction in sleep duration of 24 minutes. The associations between screen time and sleep outcomes did not differ for social media use versus other activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent of screen time, participants who exclusively used social media had lower odds of insomnia and longer sleep duration compared to those engaging in other activities or a mix of activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion:&lt;/strong&gt; The present study found that increased screen time in bed is linked to poorer sleep, across activity type. Future research should refine classifications, assess specific content, and employ experimental approaches to determine causal mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:22:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTFBydElTRUc5UGZSLVZqTVFPc0ZsZHZJSjFZRGlJX1N6YklRemhVdmRYcmpMMmxoWTBBbzlYSENrdVpiaThuYkJHSHFSYUtzSE5KVHc3dkJFT1NQczR4Y2s5VG55THU0M0U</guid></item><item><title>Your zip code could determine if you develop a deadly heart condition… what's the risk where you live? - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQcXhFZWVwa3BUcTFhU1dpZDV3anhWSVliVVhpWlJkYi1oaE9GZ2dzSWdEbXlkS1QtOU55bGlvVG96VG5nWnhoOEg1anhvTW95M0h5R3h2LTdvNzQwcFUxdVo4ck1IZ2t5X2hhY0hSTTJ3R3ZQTjhSZUc0RVM0TDB0UXFxMFVFTEVnd1Awa0dmcHA0Q3NwWExCbjRwTHPSAaIBQVVfeXFMT1dFRTBUTkdaNVN5MjFnTDI4cXVDR21QNXlJN1NqbXJPUm84UEltOWViY21jcXZNak9QNVBXTXhrSUVJSWNLT0sydy1SUFc0TmYzdWtIdU1LTTB6aGxhM2Y1S2VnZkVhb1lqYkZvUjJpbnBNZWluVGhMVDl0SHhpWE9rQkZwZVJfQmNkUVZLT0wtV2hxOC1PZXdKdjF5OUlWQXhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Living in rural America may be increasing your chances of developing heart disease and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-cc498d60-0e6a-11f0-b85f-af5a12500c95" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite many believing living in open spaces with less pollution is better for a person's health, a new study has revealed that may not be true. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-667a1570-0f07-11f0-b814-0181101fa1a1"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/missouri/index.html" id="mol-667a3c80-0f07-11f0-b814-0181101fa1a1"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; measured the risk rural residents had compared to urban residents for six different &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13023639/Why-not-just-HIGH-blood-pressure-worry.html"&gt;cardiac risk factors, including high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and hyperlipidemia - high levels of fats in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, rural Americans had an increased risk of developing five of the six conditions - no increased risk was observed for stroke - including a 19 percent higher risk of high blood pressure and a 27 percent higher risk of obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, results showed a 12.5 percent higher risk of diabetes; a 36 percent higher risk of heart disease; and a nine percent higher risk of hyperlipidemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of these conditions are major risk factors for multiple cardiovascular diseases that could be deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team, which was funded by the NIH, found that poverty, education level, food insecurity and home ownership were the major factors driving the differences among both groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Living in rural America may be increasing your chances of developing heart disease and diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the 2020 census, 265million Americans (80 percent) live in urban areas and 66million (20 percent) live in rural areas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2832034?guestAccessKey=f5a44008-a1f5-4397-b878-591c509b6771&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=033125"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published in JAMA Cardiology, analyzed data taken from the 2022 National Health Interview Survey of 27,200 adults over the age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the respondents, 4,250 (14 percent) lived in rural areas, 14,740 (55 percent) lived in small/medium metro areas and 8,175 (31 percent) lived in urban areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were asked to fill out questionnaires that inquired about their health insurance coverage, how often they visit the doctor, lifestyle factors including smoking habits and physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were also asked their household income, education level, food insecurity and whether they owned a home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The responses were then evaluated to predict a person's likelihood of developing hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed people living in rural America had a 37 percent chance of developing hypertension and a 29 percent chance of developing hyperlipidemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also had a 41 percent chance of being obese, a nearly seven percent chance of developing CHD and an 11 percent chance of having diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, city-dwellers only had a 31 percent likelihood of developing hypertension, 27 percent chance of hyperlipidemia, 30 percent chance of being obese, a four percent chance of having CHD and 10 percent likelihood of being diabetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No differences were observed for stroke prevalence or risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only group that saw urbanites and suburbanites have an increased risk over rural Americans was 20- to 39-year-olds for hyperlipidemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who live in rural areas in the south are at the highest risk of four of the six indications measured - high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rural Americans in the northeast, however, have the highest risk of heart disease and obesity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'The finding that rural-urban cardiovascular health disparities were largest among young adults is alarming, particularly against the backdrop of rapidly worsening cardiovascular health in this population.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Multiple studies have found there is a health discrepancy across the nation, with the southern region in particular experiencing poor health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 38million Americans have diabetes. According to the Rural Health Information Hub, rural areas are more likely to have higher percentages of people with diabetes and more rural regions of the US have people with diabetes than urban areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A similar trend is seen with obesity rates and heart disease death rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The left map shows the prevalence of diabetes in urban areas and the right map shows the prevalence of the disease in rural areas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the prevalence of high blood pressure among rural and urban Americans of different age groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the prevalence of obesity among rural and urban Americans of different age groups (dark blue represents urban; medium blue represents suburban; and light blue represents rural)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Previous studies have concluded that inadequate access to healthcare, hospital and doctor offices closures and gaps in insurance coverage all contribute to subpar health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, less physical activity, poor diet and higher smoking rates in southern states, as well as lower income and education attainment, all play a role in declining health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the latest study confirmed, adults residing in rural areas were older, actively smoking, not exercising, had lower i&lt;span&gt;ncomes and levels of education and experienced food insecurity.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of these factors can compound on one another, poor diet can lead to diabetes and obesity, which then raises the risk of high blood pressure and can cause heart disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, in the latest study, having access to healthcare did not factor into the differences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on their findings, the researchers wrote: 'Concerted efforts to improve socioeconomic conditions across rural America may be critical for addressing the widening rural-urban gap in cardiovascular health.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 12:08:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQcXhFZWVwa3BUcTFhU1dpZDV3anhWSVliVVhpWlJkYi1oaE9GZ2dzSWdEbXlkS1QtOU55bGlvVG96VG5nWnhoOEg1anhvTW95M0h5R3h2LTdvNzQwcFUxdVo4ck1IZ2t5X2hhY0hSTTJ3R3ZQTjhSZUc0RVM0TDB0UXFxMFVFTEVnd1Awa0dmcHA0Q3NwWExCbjRwTHPSAaIBQVVfeXFMT1dFRTBUTkdaNVN5MjFnTDI4cXVDR21QNXlJN1NqbXJPUm84UEltOWViY21jcXZNak9QNVBXTXhrSUVJSWNLT0sydy1SUFc0TmYzdWtIdU1LTTB6aGxhM2Y1S2VnZkVhb1lqYkZvUjJpbnBNZWluVGhMVDl0SHhpWE9rQkZwZVJfQmNkUVZLT0wtV2hxOC1PZXdKdjF5OUlWQXhB</guid></item><item><title>Washington misuses COVID funds, then plays victim - MyNorthwest.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPd18wSzUyaUpSbEhLcnFiSW4tX296MXRJZERZRXJsVUJtMjAtamRYUXM4RklnWVBtZjZYVWtOcnNMTm9WZTRuSG1fQnVWSHR5aHZsYXdiT2w5Y3FUTWFfTHhvVmZrdG5ocHhQZDI1N2h4eWF6V0lHQW9MeHJpeFQtX1V3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story_body"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Washington Democrats decried the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Trump administration for cutting grants to health programs. But you’re not getting the full story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Nick Brown joined a coalition of 24 states this week in suing the HHS and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., for terminating billions in public health grants to the states. Brown, in a statement, said Washington will lose $159 million from the grant cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Brown and left-wing media outlets are leaving out is that the funds in question were for COVID-19 pandemic-related programs. The state of Washington just kept using federal funds for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The cut funds were for COVID-19, but Washington used them elsewhere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement to “The Jason Rantz Show” on KTTH, a Washington Department of Health (WA-DOH) spokesperson acknowledged that the grants targeted are “pandemic-related grants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This funding has been essential in supporting critical public health systems, including disease monitoring, reporting, and vaccine efforts for COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses,” the spokesperson explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington Democrats and the WA-DOH say the cuts put critical health programs in deep jeopardy. Perhaps. But it’s 2025. We’re years passed the COVID-19 pandemic, so why would the state continue to receive or expect COVID-related grant dollars?&lt;/p&gt;
                            
                        
&lt;h3&gt;Here are some COVID programs that lost funding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may support how the dollars are being spent, but they’re not going towards their intended purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, $20 million in funding for COVID-19 vaccine immunizations was rescinded. This impacts 46 full-time employees that we’re supposed to pretend are hard at work offering COVID-19 vaccines to the public. Another $3 million was cut from initiatives to address COVID-19 health disparities among high-risk and underserved populations. COVID-19 has developed into a cold. This is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these programs were pushed into work well outside of the COVID-19 pandemic. And they may be worthy of funding. But the state should pay for it itself &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;apply for relevant grants from the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Washington was misusing funds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pandemic is long over. These funds are no longer necessary, yet the state kept accepting the funds as if they would be here forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can argue that the mechanism by which the funds were cut is illegal. Perhaps it is. But the public is being sold misinformation from Democrats and their media allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ll have you think that it’s the Trump administration that’s stealing from health programs when the reality is that it was the WA-DOH that was effectively stealing from the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-brussels-sprouts-can-improve-heart-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Brussels Sprouts Can Improve Heart Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rich in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is an important nutrient that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7871141/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-don-t-eat-enough-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;many of us don’t get enough of&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And Brussels sprouts are loaded with it. One cup of Brussels sprouts packs 6 grams of filling fiber, helping you get the recommended 25 to 38 grams you need each day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, we usually think of fiber for digestive health. However, research finds that its beneficial impact on gut health may indirectly enhance cardiovascular health. For instance, one study found that fiber-rich diets may lead to favorable changes in gut bacteria that help lower blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How does that happen? Like the rest of us, your good gut bacteria need food to survive. In the case of your gut microbes, that food is fiber. But fiber is not just about nourishing your good gut bacteria. After gut microbes eat fiber, they produce beneficial compounds called short-chain fatty acids, which are believed to improve heart health by decreasing blood pressure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Vitamin K &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7914418/what-is-vitamin-k/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin K&lt;/a&gt; may not get as much attention as other vitamins. Yet, when it comes to heart health, it should. Conveniently, Brussels sprouts are one of the very best sources of this heart-supporting vitamin. One cup of cooked Brussels sprouts gives you two-and-a-half times the vitamin K you need per day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What makes this often-overlooked vitamin so beneficial for your heart? For starters, vitamin K is a key nutrient for healthy arteries, says Natker. According to the National Institutes of Health, there also seems to be a connection between increased calcification of arteries and insufficient vitamin K intakes. However, experts still aren’t sure exactly why.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In the meantime, adding more vitamin K-rich foods, like Brussels sprouts, to your plate could be a smart move for your heart. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just know that vitamin K can interact with certain medications, especially blood thinners. So, if you are taking blood-thinning medication, speak with your health care provider before increasing your intake of these vitamin K-rich veggies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Nitrates    &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In nutrition circles, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8048704/new-study-are-nitrates-bad-for-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nitrates&lt;/a&gt; are a controversial subject. So, you might be surprised to learn that research has found that natural nitrates in vegetables, like Brussels sprouts, may benefit your heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; How so? When we eat foods containing natural nitrates, our bodies convert them into a compound called nitric oxide that helps expand our blood vessels. This, in turn, allows blood to flow freely, lowering blood pressure and improving circulation. Research suggests the combination of nitrates and vitamin K may explain why cruciferous vegetables such as Brussels sprouts have a blood pressure-lowering effect.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Vitamin C &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Did you know that Brussels sprouts are one of the best vegetable sources of&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-c-vegetables-8768521" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;? One cup of cooked Brussels gives you nearly an entire day’s worth of this antioxidant vitamin. That’s not just good news for your immune system. Vitamin C plays a role in combating free radicals in the body that wreak havoc on your heart health and lead to conditions like atherosclerosis. And there’s more. Like dietary nitrates, vitamin C can also increase your body’s nitric oxide production to keep blood flow smooth and steady.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Potassium  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Last but certainly not least, potassium is another nutrient in Brussels sprouts that keeps your heart in top shape. Unfortunately, most of us aren’t consuming enough of it. Brussels sprouts can help. One cup of cooked Brussels sprouts packs roughly 10% of the Daily Value of this under-consumed mineral. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s encouraging news for your heart, as potassium is a key player in blood pressure regulation. It works by offsetting the blood pressure-raising impact of sodium (which, conversely, most of us eat too much of). In addition to helping lower blood pressure for people with hypertension, it may also protect against heart disease and stroke, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you’re already a Brussels sprout lover or could use some fresh, new ideas, these tips can help.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roast or Pan-Fry in EVOO. &lt;/strong&gt;Lavie is a big fan of olive oil for its heart-healthy benefits. While a simple side of Brussels roasted with olive oil is always a win, these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/maple-balsamic-roasted-brussels-sprouts-7971693" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Maple-Balsamic Roasted Brussels Sprouts&lt;/a&gt; will take yours to the next level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toss into Salads. &lt;/strong&gt;Pre-shredded Brussels sprouts are an easy way to up the nutrition ante of your salad. Next time you’re grocery shopping, grab a bag to add to a simple &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8067520/shaved-brussels-sprouts-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;spring salad&lt;/a&gt;, a hearty &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/255761/apple-fig-brussels-sprouts-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Apple, Fig &amp;amp; Brussels Sprouts Salad&lt;/a&gt; or Giada De Laurentiis’ famous &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/giada-de-laurentiis-roasted-broccoli-brussels-sprouts-salad-8421678" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Roasted Broccoli &amp;amp; Brussels Sprouts Salad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprinkle on Pizza and Tacos. &lt;/strong&gt;Mix up pizza or taco night with a generous topping of shaved Brussels on your pie or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7868380/chicken-tacos-with-brussels-sprouts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;tacos&lt;/a&gt;, says Natker.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Them Crunchy! &lt;/strong&gt;Whether it’s our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8002566/crispy-roasted-brussels-sprouts-with-panko/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;Crispy Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Panko&lt;/a&gt; or a sheet pan of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7887813/crispy-smashed-brussels-sprouts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="7"&gt;Crispy Smashed Brussels Sprouts&lt;/a&gt;, they’re filled with crispy, crunchy goodness. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Up the Barbecue. &lt;/strong&gt;Brussels sprouts are fantastic grilled. And you don’t even need to cut them! Simply toss whole Brussels sprouts with olive oil, salt, pepper and your favorite seasonings. Then, thread them onto a skewer or pop them into a grill basket and barbecue them for a flavorful twist for your next cookout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enlist Your Air Fryer. &lt;/strong&gt;You’ll be amazed by the results! Use this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/277262/air-fryer-brussels-sprouts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="8"&gt;air-fryer Brussels sprout recipe&lt;/a&gt; as a road map—minus the bacon (we love bacon as much as anyone, but when heart health is a goal, less is more).  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Brussels sprouts may not get as much attention as other vegetables. But heart-health experts think they should. These hearty, cruciferous veggies serve up heart-friendly fiber, nitrates, potassium and vitamins K and C. And there are a surprising number of tasty ways to prepare them! Whether they’re roasted, grilled, air-fried or tossed onto pizzas, tacos or salads, it’s time to say goodbye to Grandma’s plain, boiled Brussels sprouts and hello to better heart health!

It's going to help with antioxidants, which are a good thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who might not enjoy eating fish, Whyte encouraged giving it a try, as there are a variety of "healthy fish" that can be cooked in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It really is a superfood, and that's an easy step that people can take," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight gain can often occur due to "mindless" snacking, which often involves unhealthy options, according to Whyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You buy foods that you're trying to avoid, so we have to stop doing that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor suggested swapping out common snacks like chips and cookies for &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthier choices;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthier choices&lt;/a&gt; like sliced vegetables and hummus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Weight gain can often occur due to "mindless" snacking, which most likely involves unhealthy options, according to Whyte.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Try to focus on some unsalted mixed nuts," he recommended. "Prepare those healthy snacks so you have them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key step to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy eating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy eating&lt;/a&gt; is preparation, Whyte added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're hungry, you eat what's available," he said. "So, if you have more healthy options at home, you're more likely to eat them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement has the nation re-evaluating what people are consuming, Whyte agreed that there are "lots of things that we need to be doing in order to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:make food healthier;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;make food healthier&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's so much food that we consume that's processed and, even more concerning, ultraprocessed," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It often seems to be more convenient. It's cheaper, it lasts longer," he went on. "And sometimes, I'm concerned about how long some of these foods last.

How do we make it more available? How do we make it economical for people?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To decipher whether &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:food is healthy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;food is healthy&lt;/a&gt; or not, Whyte encouraged people to check food labels and note how many ingredients are unrecognizable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to move to this concept [of] more whole foods, foods that are less processed," he said.

This is not to make you feel hopeless but to adjust your expectations and help you give yourself grace. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In many instances, depression is a system shutdown following a period of overwhelm that allows your brain and body to reset and regenerate ― even though it feels terrible while it is happening,” Amorosi explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the same time, some steps can lessen the likelihood:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know the early warning signs and get proactive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Being able to recognize that a depression attack is coming — to the extent you’re able to — can be super helpful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few early signs include mood dips, increased self-criticism and a desire to withdraw, according to Shields. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Tracking these patterns through journaling or mindful check-ins can help you intervene early,” she said. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anxiety-hack-soften-gaze-calming-effect_l_664f4db1e4b042129b89d6a6" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Small grounding techniques" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b89e4be4b09eb937701e33" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="664f4db1e4b042129b89d6a6" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Small grounding techniques&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, such as changing your environment or engaging in self-soothing activities, can prevent escalation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address unresolved emotional struggles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Think about any underlying issues that may make you more likely to experience a depression attack. For example, maybe you need to work through a past trauma in therapy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many depression attacks stem from unprocessed emotions,” Shields said. To untangle them, she encouraged therapy, creative expression and reflective practices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat yourself like you would on a sick day or day off.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is another way to get on top of a depression attack before it comes. Amorosi encouraged sleeping and resting, feeding yourself well, maintaining hygiene practices, connecting with others and seeking out what feels good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If and when you experience a depression attack, you can manage it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Don’t panic,” Amorosi said. “You are still in control of yourself, you can still take care of yourself and you will feel better soon.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She and Shields shared their best tips:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Simply calling a depression attack what it is (with self-compassion) can make a difference. According to Shields, it creates psychological distance and is a way to remind yourself it’s temporary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage your body.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Depression attacks cause a “freeze” response, Shields said, making us want to not move. But as you may have heard, activation is often needed before motivation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shields recommended gentle movement (like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hip-flexor-stretch-aging_l_66a8fa85e4b0a3cd43f74797" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="stretching" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b89e4be4b09eb937701e33" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66a8fa85e4b0a3cd43f74797" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;stretching&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, going outside, taking a deep breath or running your hands under warm water) to get your nervous system out of this mode.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek connection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another unhelpful temptation that often comes with bouts of depression is isolation. You can get out of that rut with even a small act.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If speaking feels too difficult, having a pre-written text, like ‘I’m struggling — can you check in?’ can make reaching out easier in the moment,” Shields said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize routines.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your brain loves consistency.

(So back to the “activation comes before motivation” reminder.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge negative thoughts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During a depression attack, you may have mean, unhelpful thoughts toward yourself or life — which can make you feel even worse. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amorosi recommended challenging thoughts that are judgmental, hateful or fearful, noting this can also help you avoid destructive coping behaviors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Rather than viewing them as personal failures, we can see them as signals pointing to unmet needs, unresolved emotions or nervous system overload,” Shields added. “Healing isn’t about eliminating them entirely but learning how to meet them with awareness and self-compassion.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:00:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOY2g5S21ZLUJpTGJDUmx5aTJ1emFYcW43ME9LeDgyd2dwdWVxVU1CZkxkaXBudVJ1eC04ekJ3RDRUbWZzOGh3TXdTMHJFQkxlMEZXamtMRUZxY1JnRVJvSmZxalZUS0hYenp0Y2ZOcGJqWFJETlFEcUh0TjJEQXhCc0l0YkxraHY0ZmlMbWpkOGtoaVnSAZgBQVVfeXFMT19IRU45VlNYQmNKMzcwQ2lwZWxqcVNpMXZMRC03ZTB3V1F6bm1yQnVLTWxFaDFMdHlfU3NMR3ZIUVA3UFpndjFydlYwNVFHTmMtZHR1UGpGS19uVkExYkt4NE9kM3pCMEw1ak14TDdmMkdYNVJaMGFOeVEwN2RrSmVRU2o4U0NQdFdHM1YwQzFyQ0tIZ0kwRjc</guid></item><item><title>This Startup Says It Can Clean Your Blood of Microplastics - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNZ1BjNlJrRXNkMkFKUHJLbEpBUmJIbXQ3QjVqM0RIcHlYWEtMczJkSWFPalM0cHRISmNGM3hnODRZTXZ2ZDR3T1FKNmN0ZVo1bVpkUVFDRTctazA1cjhFRTdvcFA3N2RCNEFrQldhb2o3UWhJYjNnY2Rxa1d4LXFiNTVJb3l2MFJfdUgwcFg0M2VlTGRUek9ueGdibkJkM1dqRHktcEZB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;This is a&lt;/span&gt; non-exhaustive list of places microplastics have been found: Mount Everest, the Mariana Trench, Antarctic snow, clouds, plankton, turtles, whales, cattle, birds, tap water, beer, salt, human placentas, semen, breast milk, feces, testicles, livers, brains, arteries, and blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;My blood, specifically. In early March I milked a few drops out of my fingertips and sent the sample to be tested for microplastics. I was in the London office of Clarify Clinics—a firm that offers to cleanse your blood of microplastics, forever chemicals, and other toxins, in treatments that start at £9,750 ($12,636).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Each week around 10 to 15 people walk into the basement clinic just off Harley Street—a road famed for its private clinics and wealthy clientele. After a consultation, the patients settle down in an armchair for the treatment. Blood is drawn from a cannula into a machine that separates out the plasma from blood cells. That plasma is filtered through a column that is supposed to trap microplastics and other undesirable chemicals, before being mixed back with the blood cells and pumped back into the patient. All-in-all the process runs for up to two hours—enough time to process 50 to 80 percent of the blood plasma volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Once it’s running, you feel nothing. It’s very comfortable,” says Yael Cohen, CEO of Clarify Clinic. “Patients take calls, do Zooms, watch movies, sleep. The ones who sleep are my favorite.” They come for all kinds of reasons, Cohen says: Some are suffering with chronic fatigue, others with brain fog or long Covid. The clinic also runs treatments marketed toward people on Ozempic-style weight-loss drugs, looking to conceive, or ward off dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;What Clarify sells them is the hope of easing their symptoms by ridding their blood of microplastics, or other potential contaminants such as PFAS chemicals (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) and pesticides. But the science on how microplastics affect our health is still far from conclusive. A 2022 &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/362049/9789240054608-eng.pdf?sequence=1"&gt;WHO report&lt;/a&gt; into microplastics concluded that there wasn’t yet enough evidence to figure out whether they posed a risk to human health. We don’t know microplastics are safe, the report concluded, but we also don’t know the risks they might pose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The dose makes the poison,” says Frederic Béen, an environmental contaminants researcher at the Amsterdam Institute for Life and Environment. “That’s the reason why it is important to determine accurately how much microplastics or any other type of environmental contaminants humans are exposed to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;There have been an onslaught of scientific papers that have tracked microplastics to every inch of the Earth’s surface and deep within our bodies, but very few attempt to tease out the impact these have on our health.

Not only is it the most abundant &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/search?q=PROTEIN&amp;amp;sort=score+desc" target="_blank"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; in our body, but its (inevitable) loss has a visible impact our looks. In fact, collagen makes up an astounding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/collagen-fiber" target="_blank"&gt;75%&lt;/a&gt; of the dry weight of the skin—so you better believe its absence is noticeable. This may explain our collective obsession with keeping our collagen levels &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/collagen-banking" target="_blank"&gt;as high as possible&lt;/a&gt;—especially since, from age of 25 and up, we lose around 1% of our collagen a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The collagen present in our skin is the result of a balance between synthesis and degradation,” explains &lt;a data-offer-url="https://app.infarma.es/infarma2024/es/speaker/detail/5650226" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://app.infarma.es/infarma2024/es/speaker/detail/5650226"}' href="https://app.infarma.es/infarma2024/es/speaker/detail/5650226" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mercedes Abarquero Cerezo&lt;/a&gt;, pharmacist and head of scientific projects at L’Oréal Dermatological Beauty Spain. “With the passage of time, the cells in charge of collagen synthesis reduce their activity. Plus, environmental factors like the sun, lifestyle factors like diet or stress, as well as hormone changes, accelerate its degradation—especially in women during &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/the-5-small-lifestyle-changes-that-eased-my-menopause-symptoms-fast" target="_blank"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the loss occurs slowly over time—so slowly that you probably won’t notice it at first. “Our body is a system in balance,” explains Abarquero Cerezo. “In the case of our skin, collagen is continuously degrading and collagen is continuously forming. Any imbalance in the quantity or quality produced means that we begin to notice changes as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 signs your skin is losing collagen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistically, these changes usually start around the age of 25, but Abarquero Cerezo notes that we could start losing collagen even earlier due to our lifestyle or habits. This loss produces changes in the “internal structure which in turn creates visible losses in firmness along with more apparent wrinkles,” Abarquero Cerezo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the most obvious signs that this loss has begun?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say those are the only signs. Other signs of losing collagen include the skin appearing thinner, the area around the eyes appearing more hollow, changes in the face shape such as narrow temples, more visible cellulite, brittle nails and hair, and even joint pain and muscle weakness. Collagen really does impact everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collagen and menopause&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as hormonal changes impact the body and mood, they also impact the skin. The &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/estrogen-health-aging-menopause" target="_blank"&gt;loss of estrogen&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, seems to impact collagen loss during perimenopause and menopause. In fact, “studies show that during the first 5 years of menopause there is a decrease of up to 30% of collagen,” notes Abarquero Cerezo. “During the following 15 years, the decrease in collagen is greater than at younger ages with a reduction of 2% of collagen per year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYEFVX3lxTE1SNjVaLTFIaHJ6Njh4ZDdvMWJaakJkUkNuYVI1UHhCX0VzWE1YN2xmZ3g2eUNpSWJzcUw4X2YxclZOZ2tFSWs2czVuM295UWlVcTV6Wi05Y2RGLTVvd3VCcA</guid></item><item><title>Latest Alzheimer’s lab tests focus on memory loss, not brain plaques : Shots - Health News - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxQRVFCQTJkWFp0ZkY1eV9JNTVKa2JtSUIzYTNIMUJDd19Rd1ZNU29mV3Zlc0l0bEg3bU52d2xMVkJkYTN3bzBBNzlEb19WWWx4dGwwaGI3TU16MzJRamNZSTkzLUx3cWh6TlZKTTZiT29fQllNRzlDSUx6WXR2eTJYRVpXazVhZU5TSU9BZjhlREIyMHZWWUxHWUlLM2NWT2VMcl9JRUxMVEwyZUloOVNuUEVkSDhxd0xWbklsNXlabXlrYktNWEpfdEp3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                New tests of blood and spinal fluid could help doctors quickly identify patients who would most benefit from treatment.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When doctors suspect Alzheimer's, they can order a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/08/02/g-s1-14852/alzheimers-new-blood-tests-amyloid-tau-ptau217-diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt;blood test &lt;/a&gt;to learn whether a patient's brain contains the sticky amyloid plaques that are a hallmark of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the results of that test won't tell the whole story, says &lt;a href="https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Randall Bateman&lt;/a&gt;, a neurology professor at Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People can have a head full of amyloid, but no dementia or memory loss," Bateman says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;So he and a team of scientists have developed &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03617-7" target="_blank"&gt;a new blood test&lt;/a&gt; that can show whether Alzheimer's has actually begun to affect a person's thinking and memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It joins &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03565-2" target="_blank"&gt;another new test&lt;/a&gt;, this one of spinal fluid, that can predict whether the brain changes associated with Alzheimer's are likely to affect cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a strong indicator of memory impairment," says &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/tony-wyss-coray" target="_blank"&gt;Tony Wyss-Coray&lt;/a&gt;, a neurology professor at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Both tests, described in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, could help doctors identify patients who are likely to benefit from &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/03/1235624349/drug-alzheimers-patient-medication-perspective" target="_blank"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; that can clear the brain of amyloid plaques. Both were developed with funding from the National Institutes of Health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Looking beyond amyloid&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The blood test is the result of a search for better Alzheimer's biomarkers — measurable substances in the body that indicate the presence of a disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bateman and his team had been studying tau tangles, the abnormal clumps of protein that form inside the neurons of people with Alzheimer's. These tangles are considered a hallmark of the disease, along with amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team noticed that one region of the tau protein seemed to play a critical role in damaging neurons and causing memory loss. And they found a biomarker for this region called MTBR-tau243.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Compared with biomarkers of amyloid plaques, MTBR-tau243 "was much more related to memory loss, symptom onset, dementia stage, all the things that patients care about," Bateman says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, the team had to use spinal fluid to reliably measure levels of the new biomarker. But eventually, they developed a test that could use blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The blood test indicates how much abnormal tau is in a patient's brain, Bateman says, "and it only goes up when people are symptomatic."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the test becomes available commercially, Bateman says, it will give doctors a fast and easy way to tell whether the amyloid plaques sitting in a patient's brain are actually affecting their memory and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;It will also indicate whether Alzheimer's has progressed past the point where drug treatment is likely to help, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We can now make a much more informed choice about: How much benefit are you likely to get if you undergo a treatment to remove the amyloid plaques?" Bateman says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A measure of synapses&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another new test, this one of spinal fluid, comes from a team led by Wyss-Coray of Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says they set out to answer a simple question related to aging: "Can we find proteins that change if a person's memory is not working well?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The team studied more than 7,000 proteins in the spinal fluid of more than 3,000 people. Two proteins emerged as potential biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Levels of one protein rose dramatically in people with memory problems, while levels of the other fell sharply.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So we made a ratio between the two, and that ratio turns out to be a very good indicator of whether a person's memory is OK or not," Wyss-Coray says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The ratio also could be used to predict eventual memory loss in people who have a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In these individuals, [the ratio] goes up 10 to 20 years before they get the actual disease diagnosis," Wyss-Coray says, because that's when the first subtle signs of cognitive impairment appear.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both proteins in the test are involved in regulating synapses, the connections between neurons, says &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/paul-f-worley/2777288" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Paul Worley&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University. So it makes sense that levels of these proteins change when Alzheimer's begins to affect brain function.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The exciting thing here is that this is a process that seems to anticipate the development of cognitive decline 10, 20, 30 years later," Worley says. That means it should be possible to start treatment long before symptoms of Alzheimer's start to appear, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Worley was part of a team that &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/23798" target="_blank"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; how the loss of one of the two proteins used in the test disrupts synapses and leads to memory loss in Alzheimer's. His team also found that people could remain cognitively normal despite amyloid plaques so long as their brains had normal levels of this protein.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The importance of synapses in Alzheimer's suggests that preserving their function — perhaps by increasing levels of this protein — could be one way to treat or prevent the disease, Worley says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The fundamental biology supports that," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Tests showed he had severe &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000335.htm#:~:text=Metabolic%20acidosis%20itself%20causes%20rapid,%2C%20ongoing%20(chronic)%20condition." target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000335.htm#:~:text=Metabolic%20acidosis%20itself%20causes%20rapid,%2C%20ongoing%20(chronic)%20condition." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;metabolic acidosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which too much acid builds up in the blood.

Given the complexity of the case, he ultimately spent over a month in the intensive care unit (ICU) before being transferred to a general hospital ward to fully recover. Toward the end of his ICU stay, he had started having diarrhea. His doctors put him on a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-are-probiotics-and-how-do-they-work" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-are-probiotics-and-how-do-they-work"&gt;&lt;u&gt;probiotic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that they thought would ease the symptoms, and he continued taking that probiotic in the general ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then, after nearly two months of treatment, the man suddenly developed swelling and "severe, continuous" pain in his abdomen. Tests again revealed a high level of acid in his blood, and scans showed signs of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11976865/#:~:text=Non%2Docclusive%20mesenteric%20ischemia%20(NOMI,and%20patients%20following%20cardiac%20surgery." target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11976865/#:~:text=Non%2Docclusive%20mesenteric%20ischemia%20(NOMI,and%20patients%20following%20cardiac%20surgery." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a dangerous condition in which the intestines don't get enough blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; While investigating the man's symptoms, the medical team took a blood sample that tested positive for a bacterium called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-drug/def/clostridium-butyricum-cbm-588-probiotic-strain" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-drug/def/clostridium-butyricum-cbm-588-probiotic-strain" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clostridium butyricum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — the same bacteria contained in the probiotic supplement he'd been taking. A genetic test confirmed that the strain in the man's blood perfectly matched the probiotic strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;The man had contracted a blood infection from the bacteria in his probiotic — a condition known as probiotic-related bacteremia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;Unfortunately, the patient's condition rapidly progressed to multiorgan failure, and he became too unstable for the doctors to consider surgical treatment options. "His treatment was transitioned to palliative care and he died on the 60th hospital day," his doctors wrote in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/17/8/e261578" target="_blank" data-url="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/17/8/e261578" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-f99gX6rC3iUPrSDe7fsoG7" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-f99gX6rC3iUPrSDe7fsoG7 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Probiotic-related bacteremia is a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/probiotics-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/probiotics-what-you-need-to-know" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;known risk of taking probiotics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it is rare. Having a weakened immune system or abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract can raise the risk of these blood infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they do occur, the infections are seen most often in older adults with multiple medical conditions. In the man's case, he had a history of alcohol dependence, smoking, colon cancer, high blood pressure and chest pain due to heart disease, along with the conditions that caused his initial trip to the ER. The report didn't note how recently the man had had cancer or if he'd undergone chemotherapy, which can suppress the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While being treated, he'd also been given a steroid to tamp down the inflammation driven by his COVID-19 infection, and steroidal drugs suppress the immune system. This may have further increased the likelihood of developing a bloodstream infection from a probiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/4/23-1633_article" target="_blank" data-url="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/4/23-1633_article" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;this is not the only case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of this particular strain of&lt;em&gt; C. butyricum &lt;/em&gt;causing probiotic-related bacteremia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The probiotic is widely used, especially in Japan, and generally has a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8078720/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8078720/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;good safety profile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Art King knows egg prices nationally have been on a roller coaster ride. They still cost an average of almost three times what they did in July 2023, but not at his farm market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As co-owner of Harvest Valley Farms in West Deer, King has been selling eggs for about $6 per dozen for years, and his prices haven’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He attributes it to producing some of the eggs at his own farm and buying the rest from another small local farm, not a large national egg producer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this has made his prices more competitive with the national average of about $5.90 per dozen, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, King says it also affords some protection from the biggest cause of higher egg prices: avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, smaller farms say they’ve been a beneficiary of rising egg prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small egg producers don’t have giant flocks of chickens concentrated in pens. Most boast free-range, or at least pasture-fed hens, making them less susceptible to a widespread flu outbreak. Egg shortages — caused largely by the killing of entire flocks where the flu is detected — has had less of an effect on smaller producers so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a simple lesson of economics: when the supply goes down, the price goes up,” King said of the national prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s much the same formula at Nature’s Grove Farm near Latrobe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Vlcek, Nature’s Grove co-owner, has kept prices steady, even prior to the pandemic, by joining forces with other local farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We partner with a local Amish farmer who we have known for years, and he grows his own organic grains. He does not source them from another country; we don’t need to worry about the price of pesticides going up. It’s a fairly steady price from year to year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when we are not dependent on government subsidized crops or chemical fertilizers, we are able to offer a true price for our eggs and meat, free from much of the influence of market swings,” Vlcek said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vlcek also attributes a lack of avian flu’s impact on good farming practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you cram 40,000 birds in a hen house, living on top of their own manure, stripped of any green grass, bugs and sunlight, and feed them a ration that is catered to either putting on muscle (for meat chickens) or increasing laying production instead of nutrition, you are putting all the pieces in place that create an immuno-suppressed animal … one dependent on pharmaceutical fixes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vlcek doesn’t know of a single pasture-based operation that has suffered mass losses from avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Nature’s Grove, chickens are raised in pastures and are moved around freely. From his experience, Vlcek has noted poultry that consume grass are far less susceptible to avian influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Chlorophyll is one of nature’s best detoxes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Freehling Farms near Kittanning, where King gets many of his eggs, there is high demand. The family-owned and -operated poultry farm is seeing increased sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are very busy with the increased demand for eggs and chickens. The number of calls, texts and messages that we are answering on a daily basis is the highest I’ve ever seen it,” owner Roger Freehling said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They sell 500 to 600 dozen per week, amounting to 2,000 dozen per month from the farm’s 1,500 hens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Freehling’s, they mainly sell to local markets and smaller farms, such as Harvest Valley and Dilner Family Farms, also in West Deer. Freehling said his farm’s eggs have consistently sold for $4.99 per dozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;A real threat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding bird flu has required a few extra precautions, even for smaller producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freehling’s birds normally would spend warmer months in pastures, but keeping them away from wild birds — a prime source of avian flu — has required the use of pens, where the hens are housed “loosely,” not crowded together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a very devastating infection and the widest infection in poultry,” said Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi, chair of infectious diseases and microbiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biosecurity measures, like washing shoes or tires before entering the chicken house and washing hands and wearing protective clothing, are the greatest defense against bird flu, Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter how big or small the farm is or number of flocks. The key is not lapsing on biosecurity. Anything they can do to prevent the virus from entering is the best weapon they have to save their flocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current strategy the U.S. uses to control bird flu is to kill an entire flock if the disease is detected, Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measure is supposed to prevent the virus from spreading. Any flock within 5 kilometers of the flock that was destroyed has to undergo regular testing to make sure the infection hasn’t spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014 and 2015, that method worked, and the virus went away. This time is different because the number of viral sources has increased, including animals that have fed on dead birds, and the disease spreading to dairy cattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first infection in cattle was reported in March 2024 in Texas. Since then, the cases in dairy cattle have been increasing to several hundred, with the highest rates in California and Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the number of hens killed that resulted in the loss of egg-laying stocks. Farmers are not able to immediately repopulate. Then, the new birds do not lay eggs immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a loss of productivity and production time,” Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freehling sees small farming as a way to avoid such shortages, “as long as it’s sustaining for the farmer to do so,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small operations don’t have the number of hens mass producers have, but they can be more adaptive with them to meet market demands or guard against infection spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Harvest Valley, there are 27 chickens, and no new chickens have come in for about six months — part of King’s care practices to avoid the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Nature’s Grove, they cut back on their egg-laying hens, but plan to grow their flock this season, Vlcek said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, King said, while egg prices are up, so are the prices for almost everything else. He doesn’t see the price of eggs as much different from the costs of other items from a consumer standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other items have increased, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-average-price-data.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;U.S. Department of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, since 2019. Bread per pound has increased by about 51%, milk per gallon by about 40%, ground beef per pound by 53% and chicken per pound by 37%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison to those items, he said, eggs aren’t all that expensive, especially when considering their high nutrient value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vlcek said the shortage is less about prices and more about the deplorable treatment of animals that has led to the spread of the bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any time we demonize wildlife and do not stop to question how we raise the birds, it gives us reason to pause,” Vlcek said.&lt;/p&gt;

In each case, the balms offer to rebalance the delicate skin microbiome, leaving it "renewed" and "refreshed". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But while skincare products often claim to be "probiotic", very few, if any, actually contain live bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;What's more, as probiotic skin treatments are classed as "cosmetics" and not medicines, their manufacturers don't have to share the results of any trials that have been conducted on their products, so it's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2v83r5wk" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;difficult to know&lt;/a&gt; how effective they are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The rules around skin care products are very different to the rules around drugs, so claims can be made with less rigorous testing than would be made for a pharmaceutical agent," says Richard Gallo, a dermatologist at UC San Diego School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Most "probiotic" skincare products contain either &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5637/5/2/41" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;prebiotics&lt;/a&gt; – nutrients that feed and encourage the growth of good bacteria on the skin, or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5637/9/3/264" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;postbiotics&lt;/a&gt; – proteins or other products made by beneficial bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"What we are seeing more and more are approaches that try to influence the microbiome," says Bernhard Paetzold, co-founder and chief scientific officer of S-Biomedic, a company that aims to treat conditions by restoring the skin's microbiome through bacterial "transplants".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to Paetzold, the main reason for this is that live bacteria are extremely difficult to keep alive throughout the manufacturing, storing and distribution process.

"But this observation just shows an association. It doesn't say that the shift in the microbiome causes that disease. It could also be that the disease changes the skin environment, and that's why the bacterial population changes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To prove that a particular strain of bacteria is causing a disease, you would need to either give a healthy person that skin disease by slathering the "bad bacteria" on their face, or cure their disease by applying "good" bacteria.

They are based on the findings that the skin of people with eczema is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/bjd/article-abstract/177/5/1394/6749742?login=false" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;dominated by &lt;i id="staphylococcus-aureus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bacterium that can often be pathogenic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"One of the big problems in the skin for diseases like eczema, is that certain pathogenic bacteria like &lt;i id="s." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;S. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="aureus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; live on the surface of the skin and cause rashes, cause disease, and cause infection," says Gallo, whose own research group has been searching for ways of harnessing the skin microbiome to fight off the harmful bacteria found thriving on eczema patients. "We mined the bacteria types that usually live on healthy skin looking for bacteria that could produce things that would fight off those bad bacteria".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Gallo's are focusing on &lt;i id="s" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="taphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;taphylococcus &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="hominis," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;hominis,&lt;/i&gt; a naturally occurring skin bacterium which is present in 21% of healthy people, but only &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aah4680" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;1% of atopic dermatitis patients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Our skin provides commensal bacteria like &lt;i id="s.-hominis" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;S. hominis&lt;/i&gt; with a safe place to live, so some of them have evolved a way of protecting their environment from these bad bacteria that are trying to invade," says Gallo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;Using special formulations of living bacteria could well help to make the skin's microbiome healthier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the case of &lt;i id="s.-hominis," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;S. hominis, &lt;/i&gt;the bacterium produces anti-microbial peptides – small fragments of protein – which directly kill &lt;i id="s." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;S. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="aureus." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;aureus. &lt;/i&gt;They also produce chemicals called "autoinducing peptides", which stop bacterial cells from communicating with one another.

Disrupting that communication can prevent the toxins from being released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In 2021, Gallo's team conducted a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01256-2" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;phase one randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; with 54 adults with atopic dermatitis by applying a cream containing live &lt;i id="s." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;S. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="hominis" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;hominis &lt;/i&gt;over the course of one week. The results showed that treatment with &lt;i id="s.-hominis" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;S. hominis&lt;/i&gt; dramatically reduced &lt;i id="s." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;S. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="aureus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; colonisation, and even decreased the redness and itch associated with atopic dermatitis in a subgroup of patients compared to a control group given a placebo cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The findings suggest that using special formulations of living bacteria could well help to make the skin's microbiome healthier.

or other causes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Working out for merely two days a week may be enough to keep cancerous tumors and heart diseases at bay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, divided nearly 100,000 people from the UK 37 to 73 years old into three groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The groups included 'active weekend warriors' - people who completed most of their exercise in one or two days; 'active regulars' - those who spread their activity throughout the week and lastly 'inactives' - participants who did not complete 150 minutes of weekly activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers then analyzed seven days worth of physical activity captured by their accelerometer (a device that measures movement), as well as health-related statistics from 2013 to 2015. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The accelerometers captured a range of activities, including walking, jogging, stationary cycling, elliptical exercises, household chores, gardening and leisure activities such as dancing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the data, over 42 percent of participants were classified as weekend warriors, about 24 percent as active regulars and nearly 34 percent as inactive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The collected data was then evaluated on how different physical activity patterns may affect the risk of dying from all causes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk for each condition was deduced using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision - a global system for medically coding causes of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to the inactive group, the weekend warrior and active regular groups had a significantly lower risk of death from all causes, cardiovascular disease and cancer if they completed 150 minutes of physical activity a week -  whether it was over two days or throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among participants in the active regular group, the risk of death from all causes was 26 percent lower; the risk of death from cardiovascular disease was 24 percent lower and the risk of death from cancer was 13 percent lower.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the conclusions, Dr Li added: 'This message is encouraging news for busy people who struggle to fit in daily workouts but can manage a concentrated burst of activity on weekends or over a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The research provides reassuring evidence that even sporadic physical activity can have lasting health benefits, making it easier for people to prioritize their well-being amid busy schedules.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;However, despite promising results about weekend workouts, it's important to be mindful of potential injury risks, especially if you haven't been active during the week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercising even twice a week can help strengthen the heart muscles, which improves their ability to pump blood efficiently and thus, lowers the possibility of developing high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also prevent the body from developing type 2 diabetes, mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, arthritis and cancers including kidney, lung and stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, despite promising results about weekend workouts, it's important to be mindful of potential injury risks, especially if you have not been active during the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Keith Diaz, a physiologist at Columbia University who was not involved in the study, warns weekend warriors may be at a slight risk of musculoskeletal injuries and should practice good measures to prevent damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained in the agency's statement: 'One important caveat to remember is that trying to fit 150 minutes of exercise into just one or two days can be a lot on your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some research suggests that weekend warriors have a slightly higher risk of musculoskeletal injuries compared to those who exercise more regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, the benefits of exercising just on the weekend far outweigh the potential risks. If you are going to be a weekend warrior, make sure you do proper warm-ups and build up and progress to higher volumes of activity over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This will help to reduce your risk of injuries.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Phthalates — &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/health/plastic-chemical-early-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;the synthetic chemicals&lt;/a&gt; used in everyday products for food packaging, personal care, toys and more — have been linked to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21854843/" target="_blank"&gt;abnormal neurological development&lt;/a&gt; in infants.

            Now, scientists may have discovered a biological pathway for how this phenomenon could occur. Researchers found that in utero exposure to phthalates is linked with altered metabolism of neurotransmitters and amino acids involved in brain maturation, according to a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57273-z" target="_blank"&gt;study published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature Communications.

            The report is the first to use untargeted metabolomics — the study of all small molecules or &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/metabolite" target="_blank"&gt;metabolites&lt;/a&gt; in a biological system — to connect a mother’s phthalate exposure to a newborn’s metabolites, and those metabolites to neurological development, said senior study author Dr. Donghai Liang via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “This represents an important step forward in understanding how prenatal chemical exposures shape infant development at the molecular level,” added Liang, an associate professor of environmental health at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The chemicals also help lubricate substances and carry fragrances in various personal care products including deodorant; nail polish; perfumes; hair gels, sprays or shampoos; soaps; and body lotions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Phthalates are &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/health/endocrine-disrupting-chemicals-wellness/index.html"&gt;also endocrine disruptors&lt;/a&gt; that have been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/health/preterm-birth-phthalates-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;linked to preterm birth&lt;/a&gt;, infant genital abnormalities, childhood obesity, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular issues, and low sperm count and testosterone in men.

            “We conducted this study because phthalates are everywhere in our daily lives,” Liang said, hence their nickname “everywhere chemicals.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The findings are based on mother-newborn pairs enrolled in the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child Cohort between 2016 and 2018. In urine samples collected from 216 mothers between eight weeks and 14 weeks of gestation at visit one and 145 participants between 24 and 30 weeks’ gestation at visit two, the authors measured eight phthalate metabolites. Participants were around age 24 on average, and their levels of some phthalate metabolites were higher than the average determined by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Within a day or two of birth, the authors collected the babies’ blood via a heel stick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The team found prenatal phthalate levels were associated with lower levels of tyrosine, an amino acid and precursor to the thyroid hormone thyroxine. Thyroxine was also abnormally low in those with in utero phthalate exposure, and low thyroxine has been previously associated with &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20350284" target="_blank"&gt;greater vulnerability to illness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0083672905710049" target="_blank"&gt;neurodevelopmental issues&lt;/a&gt; in newborns, the authors said. Tyrosine is also a precursor to the neurotransmitters &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22588-dopamine-deficiency" target="_blank"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22610-norepinephrine-noradrenaline" target="_blank"&gt;norepinephrine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22611-epinephrine-adrenaline" target="_blank"&gt;epinephrine&lt;/a&gt;, all of which partly contribute to the body’s fight-or-flight response. Low levels of these neurotransmitters can lead to various problems, including anxiety, depression and trouble focusing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z9pev900013b6mfm3qj3jn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Prenatal phthalate exposure was also linked with lower levels of the essential amino acid tryptophan, which converts into 5-hydroxytryptophan (or 5-HTP), which then turns into serotonin. Both 5-HTP and serotonin were also low. Serotonin has &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22572-serotonin#:~:text=Serotonin%20plays%20several%20roles%20in,mania%20and%20other%20health%20conditions." target="_blank"&gt;several critical roles&lt;/a&gt; in the body, including mood regulation, sleep, learning, memory, digestion and the body’s response to stress. Previous research has linked low serotonin with mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, sleep problems, and digestive issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000i3b6mxw72mdzg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These biological changes generally were also linked to lower scores on tests measuring attention and excitability, or the ability to respond to stimuli, in participants’ newborns, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000j3b6m6regklcv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Polyvinyl chloride plastic, a primary use for phthalates, “continues to increase in use globally,” said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of the New York University Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We know already — across not just brain development in babies, but a host of consequences that run from cradle to grave, and womb to tomb — that phthalates, in the form of (a) disease burden due to plastic, cost the US $250 billion annually.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000k3b6mg07dqzn2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This study just adds to a voluminous base of evidence that chemicals used in plastic materials harm human health,” Trasande added. “It’s not really something that we should be debating more actively. The more thoughtful approach would be to actually discuss what we need to do about the use of plastic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The American Chemistry Council, which represents chemical companies, said via email that its High Phthalates Panel is “dedicated to promoting the benefits of high phthalates such as DIDP and DINP.” Phthalates with a high molecular weight have seven or more carbon atoms. The study did not measure DIDP (diisodecyl) and DINP (diisononyl phthalate), but some of phthalates identified in the study were high phthalates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The study has a few important limitations, including the lack of information on participants’ diets or whether their births were vaginal or caesarean, all of which can significantly affect both phthalate exposure and a newborn’s metabolites, the authors said. Additionally, around 10% of participants reported using alcohol while pregnant, while 15% reported using tobacco and 40% reported using marijuana. There were no details collected on frequency, quantity or duration of use of those substances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The sample size is small, of course, (but) it’s a complicated and expensive study to conduct in the first place,” Trasande said. “There may be multiple mechanisms by which phthalates disrupt brain development.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Some manufacturers are creating new plastic additives they hope are safer, but it’s possible they could be as problematic as what we’re using now, Trasande said. “The burden needs to be on the manufacturers to prove that materials … are proven safe before they’re used.”

            In the meantime, people can reduce their exposure to phthalates by using glass, stainless steel or cast iron and not using nonstick cookware or microwaving or dishwashing plastic materials, Trasande said. “Microwave safe” means the container will be OK, not your food — since it can absorb microscopic particles, he added.

            Phthalates — &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/health/plastic-chemical-early-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;the synthetic chemicals&lt;/a&gt; used in everyday products for food packaging, personal care, toys and more — have been linked to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21854843/" target="_blank"&gt;abnormal neurological development&lt;/a&gt; in infants.

            Now, scientists may have discovered a biological pathway for how this phenomenon could occur. Researchers found that in utero exposure to phthalates is linked with altered metabolism of neurotransmitters and amino acids involved in brain maturation, according to a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57273-z" target="_blank"&gt;study published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature Communications.

            The report is the first to use untargeted metabolomics — the study of all small molecules or &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/metabolite" target="_blank"&gt;metabolites&lt;/a&gt; in a biological system — to connect a mother’s phthalate exposure to a newborn’s metabolites, and those metabolites to neurological development, said senior study author Dr. Donghai Liang via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “This represents an important step forward in understanding how prenatal chemical exposures shape infant development at the molecular level,” added Liang, an associate professor of environmental health at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The chemicals also help lubricate substances and carry fragrances in various personal care products including deodorant; nail polish; perfumes; hair gels, sprays or shampoos; soaps; and body lotions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Phthalates are &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/health/endocrine-disrupting-chemicals-wellness/index.html"&gt;also endocrine disruptors&lt;/a&gt; that have been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/health/preterm-birth-phthalates-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;linked to preterm birth&lt;/a&gt;, infant genital abnormalities, childhood obesity, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular issues, and low sperm count and testosterone in men.

            “We conducted this study because phthalates are everywhere in our daily lives,” Liang said, hence their nickname “everywhere chemicals.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The findings are based on mother-newborn pairs enrolled in the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child Cohort between 2016 and 2018. In urine samples collected from 216 mothers between eight weeks and 14 weeks of gestation at visit one and 145 participants between 24 and 30 weeks’ gestation at visit two, the authors measured eight phthalate metabolites. Participants were around age 24 on average, and their levels of some phthalate metabolites were higher than the average determined by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Within a day or two of birth, the authors collected the babies’ blood via a heel stick.

            The team found prenatal phthalate levels were associated with lower levels of tyrosine, an amino acid and precursor to the thyroid hormone thyroxine. Thyroxine was also abnormally low in those with in utero phthalate exposure, and low thyroxine has been previously associated with &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20350284" target="_blank"&gt;greater vulnerability to illness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0083672905710049" target="_blank"&gt;neurodevelopmental issues&lt;/a&gt; in newborns, the authors said. Tyrosine is also a precursor to the neurotransmitters &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22588-dopamine-deficiency" target="_blank"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22610-norepinephrine-noradrenaline" target="_blank"&gt;norepinephrine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22611-epinephrine-adrenaline" target="_blank"&gt;epinephrine&lt;/a&gt;, all of which partly contribute to the body’s fight-or-flight response. Low levels of these neurotransmitters can lead to various problems, including anxiety, depression and trouble focusing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z9pev900013b6mfm3qj3jn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Prenatal phthalate exposure was also linked with lower levels of the essential amino acid tryptophan, which converts into 5-hydroxytryptophan (or 5-HTP), which then turns into serotonin. Both 5-HTP and serotonin were also low. Serotonin has &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22572-serotonin#:~:text=Serotonin%20plays%20several%20roles%20in,mania%20and%20other%20health%20conditions." target="_blank"&gt;several critical roles&lt;/a&gt; in the body, including mood regulation, sleep, learning, memory, digestion and the body’s response to stress. Previous research has linked low serotonin with mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, sleep problems, and digestive issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            These biological changes generally were also linked to lower scores on tests measuring attention and excitability, or the ability to respond to stimuli, in participants’ newborns, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000j3b6m6regklcv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Polyvinyl chloride plastic, a primary use for phthalates, “continues to increase in use globally,” said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of the New York University Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We know already — across not just brain development in babies, but a host of consequences that run from cradle to grave, and womb to tomb — that phthalates, in the form of (a) disease burden due to plastic, cost the US $250 billion annually.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z78ldm000k3b6mg07dqzn2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This study just adds to a voluminous base of evidence that chemicals used in plastic materials harm human health,” Trasande added. “It’s not really something that we should be debating more actively. The more thoughtful approach would be to actually discuss what we need to do about the use of plastic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The American Chemistry Council, which represents chemical companies, said via email that its High Phthalates Panel is “dedicated to promoting the benefits of high phthalates such as DIDP and DINP.” Phthalates with a high molecular weight have seven or more carbon atoms. The study did not measure DIDP (diisodecyl) and DINP (diisononyl phthalate), but some of phthalates identified in the study were high phthalates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the National Institutes of Health rebuking many of the grants it terminated last month as “antithetical to the scientific inquiry,” experts say members of the academic community may have both administrative and legal recourse to attempt to restore some or all of their research funding. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH—which sent about $26 billion to more than 500 institutions or research centers affiliated with colleges and universities in 2024—&lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/03/28/nih-grant-terminations-have-frightening"&gt;mostly targeted projects related&lt;/a&gt; to vaccines and the health of women, racial minorities and members of the LGBTQ+ community, &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200/subpart-D/subject-group-ECFR86b76dde0e1e9dc/section-200.340" target="_blank"&gt;citing a federal regulation&lt;/a&gt; that allows agencies to terminate grants “if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While this provision exists and is broad on its face, there are some guardrails for grantees and steps that can be taken along the way to make sure these were done legally,” Amanda Fuchs Miller, a policy consultant, lawyer and former deputy assistant secretary for higher education programs at the U.S. Department of Education, said at a webinar last week hosted by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “And if termination does remain,” grantees “are allowed to recover as much as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;Some of those tools—which have already been &lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/02/18/trump-administration-faces-growing-number-lawsuits"&gt;used to challenge other executive attempts to halt or cancel federal funding&lt;/a&gt;—include parsing the particulars of individual grant agreements and pursuing agency-specific appeals processes. Per the NIH, grant recipients who received termination notices have 30 days to ask the agency’s director for a review of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it’s not clear how long it may take the NIH to hear such a high volume of potential appeals and decide if any grants should be reinstated, especially as its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, initiated the firings of some &lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/04/01/trump-admin-makes-deep-cuts-hhs-public-health"&gt;10,000 employees Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The delay in actually hearing back on the appeals request is a place of concern,” said Krystal Toups, director of contracts and grants administration for COGR, an association of affiliated medical centers, independent research institutes and research universities.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;And since a new federal budget could pass in September that might include more clear guidelines about federal funding priorities, if researchers want some consideration for continuation of their grants, Toups said they should get their cases in front of the appeals committee “sooner rather than later.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Berg, who served as director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences from 2003 to 2011, said that although appeals have to come from the institutions, grantees “would be insane” not to “push their institutions to appeal everything.” But before this year, Berg said, grant terminations were relatively rare and only reserved for extreme circumstances, so he’s not sure how seriously the Trump-run NIH will review any appeals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is completely unprecedented,” he said. “I have no idea if they intend to treat them as good-faith appeals or deny them all as a matter of course, just as they seem to be breaking the law around everything else.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2&gt;Litigation Likely&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond administrative appeals, Berg said the NIH’s justification that it can terminate a grant because it no longer “effectuates agency priorities” will “almost certainly” be litigated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When a grant is awarded to a university, there are terms and conditions that go with the grant. It’s basically a legal contract,” he said. “The question of whether the rationale they’re giving is actually legal is very much an open question. I don’t think it’s a foregone conclusion that the great majority of the terminations that have been done are in fact legal.” &lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;No lawsuit has been filed over the NIH’s grant terminations yet. But if institutions and their advocates do sue, they could argue that the grant terminations violated statutory requirements, constitutional amendments or the Administrative Procedure Act, which prohibits agencies from enacting “arbitrary” or “capricious” orders, among other possible legal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The APA argument already swayed a federal judge in Maryland last month to &lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/19/judge-orders-education-dept-restore-teacher-prep-grants"&gt;reinstate dozens of teacher-preparation grants&lt;/a&gt; the Education Department canceled because it said the programs, which included diversity, equity and inclusion–related content, were “inappropriate and unnecessary.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/06/federal-judge-blocks-nih-rate-cut-nationwide-again"&gt;A federal judge in Massachusetts has also enjoined&lt;/a&gt; the NIH’s recent guidance to cap the amount of money it sends to institutions to cover indirect research costs after a cavalry of Democratic attorneys general, institutions and trade associations argued in a lawsuit that the plan is “arbitrary and capricious,” in violation of the APA. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Samuel Bagenstos, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and general counsel for the HHS from June 2022 to December 2024, said in an email that from the termination notices he’s seen, “many folks who have lost their grants would at a minimum have strong arbitrary-and-capricious claims,” in addition to claims that the termination “violates the law creating the grant program, or violates the grant terms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond litigating potential APA violations, Ted Waters, managing partner at Feldesman Leifer LLP, who specializes in federal grant programs, said the NIH’s grant termination letters rely on language that doesn’t yet apply to grants administered by the HHS. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the last days of Trump’s first administration in 2020, the Office of Management and Budget amended the federal uniform guidance to include a provision that said a federal grant could be terminated if it “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although there were some attempts to strike that language during the Biden administration, those efforts failed. However, when OMB updated the regulations in 2024, it said agencies must “clearly and unambiguously specify all termination provisions in the terms and conditions” of a federal award. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each individual granting agency then had to adopt the uniform guidance and make any agency-specific changes. But Waters said HHS “never got around” to updating its grant provisions with OMB’s language from 2020 or the 2024 amendments. One day before the deadline, on Sept. 30, &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://links.us1.defend.egress.com/Warning?crId=67ec6b1fd1436eb1c445ff34&amp;amp;Domain=insidehighered.com&amp;amp;Threat=eNpzrShJLcpLzAEADmkDRA%3D%3D&amp;amp;Lang=en&amp;amp;Base64Url=eNoVyUEOwyAMBMAXLaZIvfQ3TgCDlBALu-X7TY6jae5qH6K1VmjTOMj1I-tejHKp_D2caj9uPUkyebjRyYOlkOiWYnojvgo4X-p9CBL2OqE8HSlG8MhozSBqQXP9A9JjJyc%3D&amp;amp;@OriginalLink=www.hrsa.gov"&gt;HHS posted in the &lt;em&gt;Federal Register&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it would wait until October 2025 to adopt the “no longer effectuates the program goals” language it’s now using to justify grant terminations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s the height of arbitrary and capricious,” Waters said, “citing a regulation that doesn’t apply to these particular NIH awards.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it’s not clear whether a lawsuit may be filed against the NIH over the grant terminations, Waters expects a challenge to come from trade associations rather than individual grantees—like &lt;a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/02/18/trump-administration-faces-growing-number-lawsuits" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/02/18/trump-administration-faces-growing-number-lawsuits"&gt;many of the other lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; filed against the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s generally better if you have a collection of institutions getting one of the national associations to file suit,” he said, noting that individual plaintiffs often have their integrity questioned on issues unrelated to the lawsuit. Instead, when associations file lawsuits, it helps keep the focus on the “the bigger picture” of if the action is lawful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

DiNicolantonio also has many research publications (over 200, as his bio on Penguin Random House &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/2145388/dr-james-dinicolantonio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt;) under his name, and has even testified in front of the Canadian Senate about the harms of added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's also the author of numerous books about nutrition. In 1999, he authored a book about a ketogenic diet called &lt;em&gt;Superfuel&lt;/em&gt;. Recently, he came out with books such as &lt;em&gt;The Longevity Solution&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Immunity Fix&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Mineral Fix&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Obesity Fix&lt;/em&gt;. Because his opinions often go against conventional medical advice, he's a somewhat controversial figure in the medical field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;His most controversial claim is perhaps the one from his book &lt;em&gt;The Salt Fix&lt;/em&gt;. In it, DiNicolantonio claims that salt isn't as bad as experts previously led us to believe. In fact, he urges people to eat more salt, not less, as we've been told before by nutrition experts, writing: "Salt everything!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; eating only 1.5mg of salt per day. They claim that on average, Americans consume too much salt: about 3.5mg a day. 2.3mg should be the very maximum, at least. DiNicolantonio, in turn, claims that people should be eating anywhere from 7.5mg to 15g of salt a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does too much salt do to us, exactly? "Significant evidence links excess sodium intake with high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and heart failure," The American Heart Association writes. They also address new research, which DiNicolantonio probably uses to base his claims on. The AHA says that often, such research is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[It includes] inaccurate sodium intake measurements and an emphasis on studying people who are sick rather than the general population," the AHA writes. "Often, the studies with paradoxical findings are poorly designed to examine the relationship between sodium intake and health outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some medical experts have even gone as far as to call DiNicolantonio's claims a danger to public health. "By advocating a high-salt diet this book is putting the health of many at risk and it undermines internationally recognised evidence that shows a diet high in salt is linked to high blood pressure, a known risk for heart disease," Prof Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at Public Health England, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/aug/08/a-danger-to-public-health-uproar-as-scientist-urges-us-to-eat-more-salt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;told The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;          &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-18"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medical experts point out that you can't ignore the evidence: the rates of heart disease have lowered. "We've got all the epidemiology, migration studies, treatment trials, mortality trials and now outcome trials in countries," Graham MacGregor, professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Wolfson Institute, Queen Mary University of London, added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Finland has reduced salt. The UK has and there have been big drops in heart deaths. You can't really argue against the importance of salt but you always get one or two people who deny it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-21"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of DiNicolantonio's claims is that sugar is far worse for us than salt. Instead of making salt the evil of all our ailments, we should blame added sugars. Salt, according to him, is an essential nutrient that we need. And that might be the only thing other experts in the medical community agree with him on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-24"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underconsumption of salt can lead to serious health issues as well. One study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27216139/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that people who consumed less than 3mg of sodium per day were more likely to pass away or have heart disease than those who consumed 4-5g. Still, experts worry that DiNicolantonio takes the possibility of salt underconsumption to an extreme and view his recommendation to eat more salt as dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-27"&gt;&lt;p&gt;DiNicolantonio also has some other &lt;a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/James_DiNicolantonio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;problematic allegations&lt;/a&gt; against him, such as being a cholesterol denialist (he says that high blood cholesterol levels do not increase the risk of heart disease) and claiming that seed and vegetable oils cause cancer, heart disease, inflammation, and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-30"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Panda is no doctor, but she thinks it's always best to consult with your own doctor when it comes to making drastic changes in your diet and lifestyle.

&lt;p id="TMFI_Article_300x250"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lane, the cancer invaded his jaw, back of his tongue, his throat, and lymph nodes. He underwent six weeks of chemotherapy and seven weeks of radiation at the Norma Schmoker Cancer Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank God it’s over,” said Lane who had his last treatment on Dec.17, the 21st anniversary of his wife, Deb Stanberg Lane, passing from breast cancer. “That was a big day.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral, head, and neck cancers are twice as likely to be found in men than in women, though they are also diagnosed more often among people over the age of 50 than they are in younger adults. &lt;/p&gt;

Rod Lane, of Humboldt, loves to ride his motorcycle but after chemotherapy and radiation treatment for squamous cell carcinoma, he sometimes feels that he doesn’t have the strength to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most Americans don’t know the early symptoms of oral, head and neck cancer, and most symptoms are easy to ignore or go completely unnoticed,” said Dr. Sarah Tofilon, medical oncologist at McFarland Clinic, who also practices at UnityPoint Health – Norma Schmoker Cancer Center. “These cancers often go undiagnosed until the later stages, after it has begun to spread. It’s through routine medical or dental exams that early symptoms are often spotted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMFI_Article2_300x250"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free screenings for oral, head and neck cancer will be provided from 3 to 6 p.m. April 17 at Iowa Central Community College’s Applied Science Technology building. Providers with UnityPoint Health — Norma Schmoker Cancer Center and the Iowa Central Community College Dental Hygiene program have partnered to provide the painless screenings at no charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wish I had had screenings like this,” said Lane. “Get checked. Do the screening. I don’t want anyone to have to experience what I’ve gone through.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tofilon, every adult should be screened for oral,  head and neck cancer, especially tobacco and alcohol users as they tend to be at greatest risk. Medical research is also finding that throat cancer cases are on the rise in younger adults who do not smoke due to the increasing rate of infection with  human papillomavirus, a potentially cancer-causing infection. Nearly 70 percent of the cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed in the United States this year will be attributed to HPV infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“HPV-related throat cancer is more difficult to detect because it usually occurs on the back of the tongue or on the tonsils,” said  Tofilon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Rod Lane sits with his younger sister, Jody during one of his treatments at the Norma Schmoker Cancer Center. Lane was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April 17 screenings are available at no cost, are painless, and take approximately 15 minutes. Appointments can be made by calling 515-574-6183. Walk-ins are also welcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope everyone takes advantage of the screenings,” said Lane, who is anxiously awaiting results from his PET scan next week. Those results will determine if he is cancer-free or if the squamous cell carcinoma has metastasized. “Don’t wait until it’s too late.”&lt;/p&gt;

As of 2024, about one in nine people aged 65 and older were living with the disease in the U.S.—that’s almost 7 million Americans. Unfortunately, there isn't a cure for Alzheimer’s. And while some researchers are looking for solutions, others are focusing their efforts on ways to prevent the disease from developing in the first place—or at least slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we know that no one food is a magic solution for any disease, some foods can be heavy hitters when it comes to disease prevention. For a recent study, researchers in South America and Denmark got together and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on kefir, a kind of fermented milk that originated in the Balkans and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team chose to look deeper into kefir because there is evidence that a healthy gut microbiome may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. We know that foods like kefir contribute probiotics, those gut-loving bacteria. And it turns out, kefir contributes more than just that. These researchers published their findings in April 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Brain Behavior and Immunity Integrative&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break down what they found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fermented-foods-for-brain-health-8729105" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 6 Best Fermented Foods for Brain Health, According to Dietitians;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The 6 Best Fermented Foods for Brain Health, According to Dietitians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study authors searched research databases for studies that had been done on kefir and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer’s disease, as well as others, like Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia and Huntington’s disease. They then began whittling down the list of studies to just those that included data on kefir and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They ended up with seven studies—four on rodents (rats and mice), two on fruit flies and one on humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did This Review Find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several findings surfaced between these seven studies. Specifically, researchers found that subjects who had consumed kefir had:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;less beta-amyloid protein accumulation in the brain (four of the studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;higher antioxidant activity and reduced oxidative damage (five studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;reductions in neuro-inflammation (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;lower levels of brain cell death (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;enhanced insulin and glucose pathways in the brain (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;restoration of the intestinal lining (two studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the human study specifically, kefir was associated with higher levels of antioxidant activity and better performance on several memory tests for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Study Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This systematic review and meta-analysis included just one human study. Because non-human studies do not always translate to the same results in humans, we cannot say with a high degree of certainty that these results apply to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers note that because kefir can differ in composition, depending on how it’s made, it presents a significant limitation when comparing the results of different studies on kefir’s benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also note that larger, long-term human studies need to be performed to understand the safety and effectiveness of kefir as a complementary therapy alongside drugs taken for Alzheimer’s disease. This means that, based on current research, they cannot confidently say whether kefir is helpful or safe alongside other treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you aren’t concerned about your Alzheimer’s risk, kefir may still be a gut-healthy beverage &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-late-night-drink-for-weight-loss-11696463" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:worth adding to your routine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;worth adding to your routine&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir is a bit more sour-tasting than plain yogurt, but it’s a great addition to smoothies since it doubles as the liquid and is a probiotic. But that’s not all kefir contributes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to these researchers, kefir is also loaded with other healthy components, including protein, unsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates and a wealth of vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, D, E and K, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the carbohydrates in kefir are complex carbohydrates, which feed the beneficial bacteria in the kefir and your gut, helping them to thrive and multiply. And if you’re lactose intolerant, there’s a chance your gut can tolerate kefir, since the process of making it reduces the amount of lactose to almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If plain kefir makes you pucker, you can find sweetened, flavored versions of kefir, usually in fruity flavors on the yogurt aisle. Just beware the sugar content, since many flavored varieties average around 8 grams of added sugar in an 8-ounce serving. With that said, if you don’t eat a lot of added sugar, this easily fits within the American Heart Association’s recommendation of limiting added sugar to no more than 25 grams a day for women and 36 grams a day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kefir also comes in various levels of fat, depending on what type of milk was used to make it—from low-fat to whole-milk. And there are other varieties, including organic, grass-fed and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032910/a2-milk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A2 kefir made from A2 milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A2 kefir made from A2 milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t do dairy? There’s something for you, too, since kefir can also be made from non-dairy milks. You’re most likely to see non-dairy kefir made from coconut milk, but you may also find it made from soy and oat milks. There’s even &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265892/water-kefir/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:water kefir;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;water kefir&lt;/a&gt; that you can make yourself by purchasing water kefir grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use kefir in any of your favorite smoothie recipes, including options like our &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257793/berry-kefir-smoothie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Berry-Kefir Smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Berry-Kefir Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir can be used in place of buttermilk in your favorite baked goods, including pancakes, waffles and muffins. It can also be used as the buttermilk base of dressings, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8045018/homemade-ranch-dressing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ranch dressing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ranch dressing&lt;/a&gt;. Or replace the milk in your mac and cheese recipe with plain kefir for an added probiotic boost. And of course, you can also sip it on its own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Your Gut Health Affects Almost Every System in Your Body—Are You Doing Enough to Care for It?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Your Gut Health Affects Almost Every System in Your Body—Are You Doing Enough to Care for It? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating probiotic foods like kefir that enhance the gut microbiome is showing promise in playing a positive role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. However, much more human research needs to be done. Until then, following an eating pattern like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-mind-diet-meal-plan-for-cognitive-health-11700108" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the MIND diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, which includes foods that have been shown to benefit brain health, is a good place to start. Besides fermented foods like kefir and yogurt, the MIND diet is also loaded with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and healthy fats. It also includes lean proteins like chicken and seafood, and limits ultra-processed foods, red meat, sugar and salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to food, other habits also play a role in brain health. If you smoke, get help to quit. Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-drink-to-limit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8743556" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:isn’t great for your brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;isn’t great for your brain health&lt;/a&gt;, so if you don’t drink, don’t start. If you do, limit your intake to no more than one or two drinks a day—though less is probably better. Loneliness is also a risk factor for dementia, so be sure you’re spending time with loved ones on a regular basis. Good sleep and regular exercise can help you out, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that list seems overwhelming, take a deep breath and try improving just one thing at a time. Start with walking around the block a couple of days a week or limiting screen time before bed for better sleep. Small steps can lead to big changes when it comes to your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/kefir-alzheimers-study-11707164" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:05:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBmeHA0RE10NnZsRXdYRmZsTVpzdWdYZGdyTkJNUUpDNGFOSWk2X1ZNeEZjUksxX1B0NGhYeHoydXdnWUpZcTc1YXcwUlRhRHd6S045R2JVZ1RNUUNjSzhlOWZvZHZaR2c2MEJuTUxmellPUElHRUE</guid></item><item><title>Kent County records first measles case in 12 years - WOODTV.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNZVZBaGRyRVFzcEhackhHZU0wcDZBcUoybC1USEVDbllGVG41Q2pkQnBjYmtBNEw4eHFiTnlKVWQxWjBWMmxGOE5DUVY4cmpYczB0bnlvUWFxaG8yWXZlU3hTbXE1dC1ydkJVVHgySTE0ZUFGOVVEUUJLUmxxbWNtcmRwam9reXRuSnZkel9lR0NRYUtiRkHSAZsBQVVfeXFMUDVCSWVvRDQtVjRkNHpBMzc0TE0zLTdXRE1ZYk55MkdFQlFRLVA1ZGlDMGZmanlOMHJMUmdRZFZSTkwzWHNEaHNWWkd6TFZqQ096Uy1aVjBNeEF6TGM3MzUyZDF1TmdUZHNBWFlEVjdSbHpLd3RDWGdJUlZrNW5PeHlHbUdNNHh3TFNnclF3czg2TkN3R3d2d0p0TjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More than five years since COVID was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/covid-19"&gt;declared a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, we’re still facing the regular emergence of new variants of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest variant on the rise is LP.8.1. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/australian-respiratory-surveillance-reports-2025"&gt;increasing in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, making up close to &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;one in five COVID cases&lt;/a&gt; in New South Wales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere it’s become even more dominant, comprising at least three in five cases &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/lp-covid-variant-cases-future-waves-3598768"&gt;in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is LP.8.1? And is it cause for concern? Let’s look at what we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An offshoot of Omicron&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LP.8.1 was first &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;detected in July 2024&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a descendant of Omicron, specifically of KP.1.1.3, which is descended from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-emergence-of-jn-1-is-an-evolutionary-step-change-in-the-covid-pandemic-why-is-this-significant-220285"&gt;JN.1&lt;/a&gt;, a subvariant that caused large waves of COVID infections around the world in late 2023 and early 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) designated LP.8.1 as a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;variant under monitoring&lt;/a&gt; in January. This was in response to its significant growth globally, and reflects that it has genetic changes which may allow the virus to spread more easily and pose a greater risk to human health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, LP.8.1 has mutations at six locations in its spike protein, the protein which allows SARS-CoV-2 to attach to our cells. One of these mutations, V445R, is thought to allow this variant to spread more easily relative to other circulating variants. V445R has been shown to increase binding to human lung cells in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00015-5/fulltext"&gt;laboratory studies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The proportion of COVID cases caused by LP.8.1 has been rising in New South Wales.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;NSW Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the symptoms of LP.8.1 don’t appear &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;to be any more severe&lt;/a&gt; than other circulating strains. And the WHO has evaluated the additional public health risk LP.8.1 poses at a global level to be low. What’s more, LP.8.1 remains a variant under monitoring, rather than a variant of interest or a variant of concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, these changes to the virus with LP.8.1 are small, and not likely to make a big difference to the trajectory of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;That doesn’t mean cases won’t rise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID as a whole is still a major national and international health concern. So far this year there have been close to &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/australian-respiratory-surveillance-reports-2025"&gt;45,000 new cases recorded in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, while around &lt;a href="https://covidlive.com.au/report/daily-hospitalised/aus"&gt;260 people are currently in hospital&lt;/a&gt; with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because many people are no longer testing or reporting their infections, the real number of cases is probably far higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;COVID is still around.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/asian-traveler-business-man-wearing-face-1739402366"&gt;Hananeko_Studio/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/australian-respiratory-surveillance-reports-2025"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, LP.8.1 has become the &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;third most dominant strain in NSW&lt;/a&gt; (behind &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/xec-is-now-in-australia-heres-what-we-know-about-this-hybrid-covid-variant-239292"&gt;XEC&lt;/a&gt; and KP.3). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250322.pdf"&gt;has been growing&lt;/a&gt; over the past couple of months and this trend looks set to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say it’s not growing similarly in other states and territories, however NSW Health publishes &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/reports.aspx"&gt;weekly respiratory surveillance&lt;/a&gt; with a breakdown of different COVID variants in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sequences of LP.8.1 in the &lt;a href="https://gisaid.org/"&gt;GISAID database&lt;/a&gt;, used to track the prevalence of variants around the world, increased from &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;around 3%&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2024 to 38% of global sequences as of &lt;a href="https://x.com/Mike_Honey_/status/1905816340331728914"&gt;mid March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some countries it’s climbed particularly high. In the United States LP.8.1 is responsible for &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;55% of cases&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/lp-covid-variant-cases-future-waves-3598768"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt;, where LP.8.1 is making up at least 60% of cases, scientists fear &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/science/new-covid-wave-cases-hospitalisations-3611459?srsltid=AfmBOor_V7pQrPMPhUYQA2KCZgRfsI_CpxTwIRiHDFJHIJhq2kbAmD42"&gt;it may be driving a new wave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Will COVID vaccines work against LP.8.1?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current COVID vaccines, including the most recently available &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-covid-vaccines-may-be-coming-to-australia-heres-what-to-know-about-the-jn-1-shots-237652"&gt;JN.1 shots&lt;/a&gt;, are still expected to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;offer good protection&lt;/a&gt; against symptomatic and severe disease with LP.8.1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, due to its designation as a variant under monitoring, WHO member countries will continue to study the behaviour &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risk-evaluation-for-sars-cov-2-variant-under-monitoring-lp81"&gt;of the LP.8.1 variant&lt;/a&gt;, including any potential capacity to evade our immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there’s no cause for panic due to LP.8.1 variant at this stage, COVID can still be a severe disease for some. Continued vigilance and vaccination, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/getting-your-vaccination"&gt;for medically vulnerable groups&lt;/a&gt;, is essential in minimising the impact of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

But it’s not just a matter of getting enough rest. Sleeping late and less than five hours a day can impact your health in various ways. Dr Dheeraj Kapoor, head of endocrinology at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Mumbai, tells Lata Mishra why getting your daily dose of shuteye is important&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How does poor sleep affect metabolism and blood sugar regulation?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation are two critical factors that contribute to conditions like Type 2 diabetes, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and fatty liver disease. Sleep deprivation, defined as getting less than 7-8 hours of sleep, and disrupted sleep quality, where a person frequently wakes up at night, both increase the risk of metabolic disorders. When sleep is compromised, the body produces excess cortisol, a stress hormone that heightens insulin resistance and increases the risk of diabetes. Additionally, hormonal imbalances occur — ghrelin (the hunger hormone) rises while leptin (which signals fullness) decreases, leading to increased appetite and cravings for high-calorie foods. Sleep deprivation also triggers inflammation and oxidative stress, further contributing to metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Can just one night of poor sleep impact us?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chronic sleep deprivation has a more profound impact, some studies indicate that even one night of poor sleep can elevate cortisol levels which, in turn, increases insulin resistance and the risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why is sleeping less than five hours and going to bed late harmful?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination disrupts the body’s circadian rhythm, the internal 24-hour clock that regulates sleep, hormone secretion, and metabolic processes. When sleep duration is too short and occurs too late at night, cortisol production rises, insulin sensitivity decreases, and metabolic disorders become more likely. Night-shift workers and those who regularly stay up late are at higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome due to these disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;If someone gets eight-plus hours of sleep but goes to bed late, are they still at risk for metabolic issues?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. While getting adequate sleep is beneficial, the timing of sleep also matters. Sleeping after midnight disrupts the circadian rhythm which regulates physiological processes, including sleep, hormone secretion, and metabolism. It helps control insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. When disrupted — due to irregular sleep schedules, shift work, or sleeping late — metabolic processes get impaired, leading to increased risks of diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Do late sleepers tend to have poorer glucose control?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their disrupted circadian rhythms affect insulin function and glucose metabolism. They also tend to have irregular eating patterns, increased cravings for high-calorie foods, and higher cortisol levels, all of which contribute to poor glucose control. Night-time eating habits further exacerbate insulin resistance, increasing the risk of metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What about other disorders like PCOS, fatty liver disease, or high cholesterol? Are they caused by poor sleep too?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Poor sleep affects hormone balance, leading to increased insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction, which play key roles in conditions like PCOS, fatty liver disease, and high cholesterol. Sleep deprivation also promotes weight gain and inflammation, both of which contribute to these metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Can exercise reduce the impact of sleep loss on insulin sensitivity?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Exercise, particularly high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and strength training, can help reduce some of the negative effects of sleep loss by improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic function. However, exercise should ideally be done in the morning, afternoon, or early evening rather than right before bedtime, as late-night workouts can increase adenosine levels and interfere with sleep quality. Also, reducing screen time before bed and avoiding caffeinated drinks can further support better sleep quality and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why does caffeine consumption disrupt sleep more as we age?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that blocks adenosine, a chemical that promotes sleep. As individuals age, the body’s ability to metabolise caffeine slows down, making its effects last longer. Older adults are also more sensitive to sleep disturbances, meaning even a small amount of caffeine consumed in the evening can lead to prolonged wakefulness and fragmented sleep. Additionally, age-related changes in sleep patterns, such as lighter sleep and increased awakenings, make the effects of caffeine more pronounced. It is recommended that older adults reduce caffeine intake in the afternoon and evening to improve sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What are some effective strategies for improving sleep hygiene?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good sleep hygiene involves adopting healthy habits that promote restful sleep. Some effective strategies include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, helps regulate the body’s internal clock.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating a comfortable sleep environment: Keeping the bedroom dark, quiet, and cool can enhance sleep quality. Using blackout curtains, white noise machines, and comfortable bedding can help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding stimulants before bedtime: Caffeine, nicotine, and heavy meals should be avoided in the evening to prevent sleep disturbances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engaging in relaxation techniques: Meditation, deep breathing exercises, or light stretching before bed can help relax the mind and body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting regular physical activity: Exercising during the day promotes better sleep, but vigorous workouts should be avoided close to bedtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxQMW1sWHdqSHdQNkNJT2JtMnI0Y1NwaDBnTDBFT08xOTFGWXVnTUZXX2lrVnIwR2tqMkhjN3gtYzZ2UUR3MzBrdGdnaEV3eWhaRUpXR0daT1B3ZXg0WFptcHhUSTBGMVhGak5zMEZqVklybVIwWXZycWhuMFFXRl9tcDQ0b05meThvQjNLSTd5MWFPQURvbDNValJNVmR2bWgtZTEtd2hXYllWaTNvanoyQUlqXzg0NHpURXJnV1Juak5EYWpwTVBsSV9pTDhoa3hDejBrQ3hlcUVxSjluN0F3Z1hVci1Ib0xMQjRiMDJtWTlKYUk4alE</guid></item><item><title>Kent County sees first measles case in over a decade, exposure locations and dates listed - WZZM13.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxOZ1hnaS1KZXVtcW1ORmNuRkFqOFhIb01zV0toRjRWZXVubnFBMF9jRlQzd1pQM1MxYnEwaW5BNlk0ekNZSTRsSXU0a2R5T0VTNUwxcHBsbjg0WXhCVjNsUW9DdC1FNEVvZjVkT203cE5YUWt2UnpXTVNCbDhMa1JaYTVmS3VWQWU5TU1nTUFXckttWGNfMlFfalFpUG5IZmRKV09RQ0M0eUZaRnBNTXBzZ1cxY0pWSFR2a3FtWlBibzFhRVc0bkRjNFdzaE9wS2ZrRVNHWllR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Kent County confirmed its first measles case in over a decade and listed times and places community members may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KENT COUNTY, Mich. — Kent County hasn't seen a case of seen a case of the measles since 2013, until now.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kent County Health Department said on Tuesday that in partnership with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, they confirmed a case of measles in a Kent County resident.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case in Kent County is Michigan's second case this year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious disease that continues to circulate both in the U.S. and globally," said Dr. Adam London, Health Officer at the KCHD. "This case is a reminder of how quickly measles can spread and the importance of vaccination. We urge residents to check their immunization status and to get vaccinated, especially if planning to travel internationally or into areas with active measles outbreaks."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department said that the infected person is an adult and had recently traveled abroad before returning to the U.S. and traveling between Michigan and New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department listed the following locations where individuals may have been exposed on specific dates:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can be spread through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves, continuing to infect others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically begin 7-14 days after exposure, according to the health department, though they can surface as late as 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department shared the following list of symptoms to watch for:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul id="isPasted"&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to over 104°F)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of mouth (Koplik Spots) 2-3 days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on face, spreads to trunk, arms and legs 3-5 days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department advised anyone who was at any of the above locations during the specified times should monitor for these symptoms for 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone experiencing symptoms is urged to call their healthcare provider before seeking in-person care to prevent further spread. The KCHD can be reached Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 616-632-7228. Individuals can call 2-1-1 for support during weekends and evenings.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles can lead to serious complications, especially in young children, pregnant individuals, and those with weakened immune systems," said Dr. Kristin Oldenberg, Medical Director at KCHD. “Fortunately, the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing measles. Two doses of the vaccine provide 97% protection against the disease."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
