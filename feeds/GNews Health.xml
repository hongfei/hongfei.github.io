An analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;) found PFAS in the blood of an estimated 97% of Americans. These chemicals have been linked to cancer, cardiovascular and liver diseases, and immune suppression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS are persistent because most can take years to leave the body, and while they are there, they can do some serious damage to your health because they constantly recirculate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver sends PFAS substances &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-bacteria-offer-new-hope-against-forever-chemicals/"&gt;into the intestines&lt;/a&gt;, and transport proteins pull some back into the bloodstream. A similar recapture can occur in the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-can-t-be-that-easy"&gt;It can’t be that easy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After asking what people can do about PFAS, a team tested a simple option using a very common and readily available &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-enough-fiber-prevents-cancer-in-a-surprising-way/"&gt;dietary supplement&lt;/a&gt;: soluble, gel-forming fiber taken with meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two recent pilot studies suggest that regularly consuming such fiber can reduce &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/wqc/aquatic-life-criteria-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PFOA&lt;/a&gt; (perfluorooctanoic acid) and &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/wqc/aquatic-life-criteria-perfluorooctane-sulfonate-pfos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PFOS&lt;/a&gt; (perfluorooctane sulfonate) – two of the most studied PFAS in a family of over 15,000 human-made chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work involves Professor Dhimiter Bello, associate dean of research in the &lt;a href="https://www.uml.edu/health-sciences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zuckerberg College of Health Sciences&lt;/a&gt; at UML, and Professor of Environmental Health Jennifer Schlezinger at &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By consuming gel-forming fibers such as psyllium with a meal, we can trap PFAS inside the fiber gel, which can then be removed in feces,” explains Bello, whose lab developed methods for measuring PFAS in human tissues and biological fluids while documenting PFAS exposure sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Professor Schlezinger and I have complementary expertise, a shared common interest and the same drive to produce impactful research,” says Bello.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-pfas-reacts-with-fiber"&gt;How PFAS reacts with fiber&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used male mice on diets modeled after typical U.S. eating patterns. Some received inulin as a control fiber and others received &lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2012.00189.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oat beta-glucan&lt;/a&gt;, a soluble dietary fiber found naturally in the cell walls of oats, as the test fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice drank water containing a mix of seven PFAS for six weeks, then switched to clean water for four weeks to see how much PFAS cleared during this washout period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the beta-glucan mice &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forever-chemicals-found-in-tap-and-bottled-water-worldwide/"&gt;drank more water&lt;/a&gt;, they took in more PFAS. The team adjusted the results to account for that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the adjustment, their blood levels of PFOA and PFOS trended lower (p &amp;lt; 0.1). These mice also had a slightly lower body fat percentage and lower fat in the liver and small intestine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS turned on some liver genes that help process chemicals; after the clean-water period, only one of those genes, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/13112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cyp3a11&lt;/a&gt;, moved back toward normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-fiber-reduces-pfas"&gt;Why fiber reduces PFAS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the better-known PFAS, like PFOA and PFOS, have been linked to higher &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-handful-of-pecan-nuts-each-day-can-lower-cholesterol-heart-health/"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, lower vaccine responses, and certain cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soluble fibers such as beta-glucan and psyllium form gels in the gut that can bind bile acids. That action is known to help lower LDL cholesterol by pushing the body to make new bile acids instead of reusing old ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because PFAS share some chemical features with bile acids, trapping them in the same gel is a reasonable approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a scientist, I had a life-meets-science moment while looking for ways to control bad cholesterol,” says Schlezinger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In published research studies, I found that consuming gel-forming fibers can increase the elimination of bile acids, which in turn reduces cholesterol in the blood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver then pulls cholesterol out of the blood to replace the lost bile acids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It occurred to me that bile acids and PFAS have similar &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bacteria-strain-identified-that-can-eat-forever-chemicals/"&gt;chemical characteristics&lt;/a&gt;, and both are recirculated between the liver, the bile and the gut,” Schlezinger continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-migrating-from-mice-to-people"&gt;Migrating from mice to people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier research linked high-fiber eating patterns with lower PFAS levels. The new pilot work tested fiber supplements with meals, using beta-glucan and psyllium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one pilot study, the researchers documented an 8% decrease in PFOS and PFOA after four weeks among people who took a fiber supplement. The researchers are running additional studies to replicate the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Increasing fiber intake with a supplement could be a win-win situation, reducing PFAS in the body with a supplement that’s available and economical,” Schlezinger enthused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before beginning any fiber supplement routine, however, you should consult with your physician.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-it-all-came-together"&gt;How it all came together&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collaboration between the two universities started as part of a larger effort to build research capabilities for PFAS biomonitoring and develop solutions to the PFAS &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/some-popular-beers-in-the-u-s-contain-forever-chemicals/"&gt;contamination problem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding from a &lt;a href="https://www.uml.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UMass Lowell&lt;/a&gt; seed grant allowed Bello to develop laboratory methods for quantifying PFAS in tissues, blood, stool, and urine in support of the pilot studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Within three years, we amended our analytical method twice to expand biomonitoring from an initial list of 15 common targets to about 50 PFAS,” says Bello. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then we built additional expertise to conduct untargeted PFAS analysis and offered in-kind PFAS testing to several research groups to promote initial data generation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pfas-fiber-and-human-health"&gt;PFAS, fiber, and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS are everywhere and stubbornly stick around, but this research points to a practical, low-cost way to nudge them out: take gel-forming soluble fiber like psyllium or beta-glucan with meals to trap PFAS in the gut and send them out of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now testing novel and inexpensive PFAS removal and detoxification strategies such as multiple fibers, different diets, and cholestyramine – a medication used to lower cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field of PFAS testing continues to change as labs refine methods and standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With thousands of PFAS species in use, we as a society have a long way to go before we can claim that we have fully understood the real scope of PFAS exposures to humans and the environment and their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forever-chemicals-in-tap-water-increase-cancer-risk-by-up-to-33/"&gt;health impact&lt;/a&gt;,” Bello concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s early, not a cure-all, and anyone considering supplements should talk to a clinician, but the signal is promising and actionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0041008X24003879?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01165-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Environmental Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 23:38:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOMEVieWJCREdRdTRrVXJJamlYSTNfSDFiM2pIc0JwWjNWSXNqU3h4Q01YWEJQTk0tclptalBXRnZUbHhjazhQa2JMOFg5aEM5bGowdFZsTF9XU1FvWm52eDBZNXh6T3FSLXMtc3U5eWVqSlVDeUZDZEcxQXpUNXhqUmpkbnFFR2JfUnlmVTItZHhJS1ItTUcxRFRmbEtRS1dBNmtRemVLa0dYd2k4WGc</guid></item><item><title>在柯林斯堡发现头上长着“触手”或“角”的兔子- 9News.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNM0VzNFNoTlpjR2lVeTJyeFdXVmY1aE5Lc1Z0WHRXLTZUSUxvcGt0X1JEOGRwbGNzQzl3ajRKOTFqcWZRdlZFVmR3U3J3dkxTNmNRR1pRTWxXNUFGaENDcW12UzhaN1otRTQyUmpMODhlNzJNU1YyMS1RVGR4OUNOaGd2MEh1ZlF0OWpQbF80R0VzWFpNRXMyRmhkbFROaHd3a0E5YmlvM1RzZUk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

According to &lt;a href="https://skylab.cdph.ca.gov/calwws/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the California department of public health’s own wastewater tracking&lt;/a&gt;, statewide infection numbers have now surpassed winter highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other metrics are also showing increases in the illness. As of Tuesday, the CDC estimates Covid-19 infections are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/rt-estimates/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;growing or probably growing in 45 states&lt;/a&gt;, which is up from 40 last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A new Covid-19 variant, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-variants.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;XFG, or “Stratus”&lt;/a&gt;, is on the rise in the US, becoming the third-most common strain of the summer. The variant was first detected in south-east Asia in January but was barely detected in the US until May. By late June, it was estimated to account for up to 14%, according to the &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During a &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-cases-rise-summer-2025-cdc-data/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CBS interview&lt;/a&gt; in July, physician Jon LaPook said that this type of rise was typical for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We now know that there’s a winter spike and then there’s a summer spike,” the outlet’s chief medical correspondent said in the interview. “And every year, the number of deaths, the number of hospitalizations, is gradually going down each season. So that’s the good news.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Still, experts caution it is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/05/us-covid-cases-rising" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;too soon to know how big the developing late-summer wave&lt;/a&gt; could get. While cases are rising more slowly than at the start of previous surges, varied immune responses from prior infections and vaccinations make it difficult to predict how severe illnesses could be. The risks are further compounded by new vaccine restrictions from the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The rise in Covid-19 cases comes as the US Department of Health and Human Services announced on Tuesday it will &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/rfk-jr-hhs-mrna-vaccine-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;terminate 22 federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, raising questions about the safety of a technology credited with helping end the pandemic and saving millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 22:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPZC1QOWdZN2hVWlhwVFRGUUtlXzBLZ1FDcE43Tm85Q1lrLXFYMENpamJLcWUycVIzX0FKYzl5cGhQMldubVdCNkU0WXJGQkpXdmJmNncwVWgyUEdmRi1JRzdUb1FIQk0xMUJ6eE5jb0tIcl9VbkxweTIxaVBEZ3pGV2dSNjk3MHBWNllN</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，这种习惯可能会使痴呆风险增加43 ％ - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTFBZVEotZ3pBNEtDVmY3dzdUOEg4djJ6dElDaEJvUkdkaTdhdTg1ZHplV081Zm5KUDlxbXJMQTZPRFdrQ2ItQk1qakJrdXByUExfek01UW12TnlhYldxQ1AxMmdJYjdWQVZHX2s1YmVB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High sugar intake was linked to a 43% higher risk of dementia in a long-term study of 158,000 adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetics influenced how added sugar affected brain health—some people were more vulnerable than others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most participants were healthier than average, limiting how widely the results may apply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7914285/ways-to-eat-less-sugar-without-missing-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating a lot of sugar (particularly added sugar) may&lt;/a&gt; raise your risk of developing dementia—and your genes could make that risk even higher. For a new study, researchers tracked more than 158,000 mostly middle-aged adults over nearly a decade and found that higher sugar intakes were linked to a significantly greater chance of developing dementia, with certain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;genetic traits amplifying that risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While dementia is often viewed as a disease of old age, its biological groundwork can be laid decades earlier. In the United States, about 1.7% of adults aged 65 to 74 are living with a diagnosed form of dementia, with rates climbing sharply after age 75.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This study followed people in their mid-50s to assess whether sugar intake at that stage of life was linked to a greater risk of developing dementia over the following decade—before symptoms typically appear.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Previous research has linked high added sugar intake to a greater risk of dementia, but few studies have explored how that risk may vary based on a person’s genetic makeup.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This new study helps fill that gap, offering a more personalized view of how sugar and genetics may work together to influence &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/worst-habits-for-brain-health-11773249" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;long-term brain health&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-the-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was the Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study was conducted by a team of medical researchers based in China with expertise in nutrition, epidemiology and chronic disease. They used data from the UK Biobank, a large ongoing health study that includes over 500,000 adults ages 37 to 73 from England, Scotland and Wales. For this analysis, the researchers focused on 158,408 participants—with an average age of 56—who had completed repeated 24-hour dietary recalls and provided genetic samples. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This allowed the team to estimate each person’s intake of added sugars (like those added to soda, candy and baked goods) and naturally-occurring sugars (naturally found in fruit and dairy) and to calculate genetic risk scores for traits related to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-eating-too-much-sugar-11721349" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugar metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, gut bacteria and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/early-onset-dementia-study-11723661" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;dementia susceptibility&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants were followed for almost 10 years, and dementia cases were identified through national health records including hospital and death registry data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over the follow-up period, about 0.7% of participants were &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/multidisciplinary-diabetes-management-may-lead-to-28-percent-lower-dementia-risk-8580567" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diagnosed with dementia&lt;/a&gt;. That may sound low, but it’s notable considering most people were in their 50s at the start—an age when dementia is still rare.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, the researchers found that people who consumed the most added sugar had a 43% higher risk of developing dementia compared to those who consumed the least. Even sugars naturally found in foods were linked to some increased risk, though the effect was smaller.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Genetics also appeared to make a difference. Participants with certain gut-related genetic traits—specifically a lower score for &lt;em&gt;Ruminococcaceae UCG-014&lt;/em&gt; or a higher score for &lt;em&gt;Oscillospira&lt;/em&gt;—were more sensitive to the effects of sugar on dementia risk. These gene-diet interactions suggest consequences depending on their biology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, like all research, this study has limitations. UK Biobank participants are, on average, more health-conscious, less likely to have obesity and more affluent than the general UK population, which means the results may not apply equally to all groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s also worth noting that about 90% of participants were white. This study didn't include a racially diverse enough population to explore how sugar, genetics and dementia risk may differ across racial or ethnic groups. Finally, the dietary information was also self-reported, which can introduce some inaccuracy. And while the study found strong links between sugar intake and dementia risk, it doesn't prove that sugar directly causes the disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dementia affects millions of people and their families. This study suggests that what you eat in your 50s—especially your sugar intake—might influence your brain health years down the road. Sugar intake is a adjustable risk factor, and cutting back on added sugars is smart advice for most people. For those with a genetic predisposition for dementia, doing so might be especially important.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And just because you decide to cut back on added sugar doesn’t mean you can’t satisfy your sweet tooth. Added sugars had a larger impact on dementia than &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural sugars&lt;/a&gt;, like those found in fruit, so fruit-forward options like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lemon-raspberry-frozen-yogurt-bites-11687804" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lemon-Raspberry Frozen Yogurt Bites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/268407/no-sugar-added-mini-apple-pies/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;No-Sugar-Added Mini Apple Pies&lt;/a&gt; can be great recipes to work into your routine.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What you eat in midlife may have long-term effects on brain health.

   &lt;p&gt;Health officials in Guangdong province in southern China are waging an all-out war against mosquitoes in response to an outbreak of the chikungunya virus that's sickened thousands with fever, rashes and joint pain over the past month.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Soldiers are fogging streets and parks in the city of Foshan with insecticide. Community workers are going door-to-door to look for stagnant water, where mosquitoes can breed. People who test positive are reportedly being forced to hospitalize to isolate themselves, says &lt;a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert/yanzhong-huang" target="_blank"&gt;Yanzhong Huang&lt;/a&gt;, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-81726" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"It's reminiscent of the COVID-19 tactics," he says, where citizens were extremely restricted in their activities to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Some of the current measures are likely overkill, says Huang. Chikungunya is rarely fatal, and the mosquito-borne virus can't spread through the air. But mosquitoes easily pick it up from infected people. And because chikungunya outbreaks are rare in China, he says "some of the measures are justified given the population has no immunity." Typically, the virus is found in Africa, southeast Asia and South America.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So far, more than 8,000 people have been infected in Guangdong, making it the largest chikungunya outbreak in China's history. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here's what you should know about chikungunya (whose name is pronounced "chick'n-GOON-ya").&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is chikungunya and how does it spread?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Chikungunya disease is caused by the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/12/01/458003755/chikungunya-a-mosquito-borne-virus-might-be-scarier-than-we-thought" target="_blank"&gt;chikungunya virus&lt;/a&gt;. It's spread through infected &lt;em&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/em&gt; mosquitoes. People can get sick within 3 to 7 days of a bite from a mosquito carrying the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The virus can cause fever, rash and fatigue, but the most notable symptom is joint pain. "It can be debilitating, where people cannot get out of bed, they are laid out," says &lt;a href="https://www.pediatrics.pitt.edu/people/laurie-silva-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Laurie Silva&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at the University of Pittsburgh. The virus is named for a word from the Kimakonde language of Tanzania — where the virus was first discovered in 1952 — that means "that which bends up," because of the distorted posture of those suffering from the pain.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Symptoms tend to resolve within a week or so, but some patients can go on to have chronic illness, says Silva. "They can have prolonged joint pain that can last for weeks or months, and in some cases years," she says. "That's one of the main concerns for this virus."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there treatments or vaccines?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are no specific antivirals for chikangunva. "It's really just rest, hydration and pain medicine," says Silva.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are two &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/21/1194974088/advancements-may-help-fight-the-chikungunya-virus-wave-in-south-america" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;licensed vaccines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but they're not widely available or used, according to the World Health Organization. In the U.S., they're only recommended for travelers or lab workers likely to be exposed to the virus. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a notice for travelers to Guangdong, urging them to exercise precautions including mosquito repellent and vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vaccines aren't currently available in China.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How common are chikungunya outbreaks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The disease was first detected in 1952 in Tanzania, and began popping up in other African and Asian countries over the subsequent decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More global outbreaks have occurred since 2004, and the virus has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/12/18/255216192/trouble-in-paradise-chikungunya-outbreak-grows-in-caribbean" target="_blank"&gt;been reported&lt;/a&gt; in more than 110 countries. Cases and outbreaks are most common in tropical and subtropical regions where mosquitoes thrive year round. Climate change and increased global travel are contributing to chikungunya's growing footprint, says Silva.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, the United States gets a handful of cases most years, mostly in returning travelers. There hasn't been a locally acquired case of chikungunya in the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/chikungunya-us.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;since 2019&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So far this year, there have been roughly 240,000 cases of chikungunya and 90 deaths from the virus, mostly in South America. Compared to other outbreaks, China's is so far small. La Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean, has reported nearly 50,000 cases so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But chikungunya can spread quickly in dense, urban areas where mosquitoes can thrive. That's why China is taking such extreme measures to tamp down the mosquito population in Foshan.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Over the past few days, confirmed cases appear to be declining, says Huang. "That seems to indicate that the disease is plateauing in Foshan," he says. But with hot and humid weather conditions in the region and travel, he adds, "we cannot rule out the possibility that the disease will spread beyond Guangdong."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Bromide can trigger these symptoms because, with long-term exposure, it builds up in the body and impairs the function of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-jykgnzHdRz2jQTbn8sfNwS" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-jykgnzHdRz2jQTbn8sfNwS slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s and 1980s, U.S. regulators removed several forms of bromide from OTC medicines, including sodium bromide. Bromism rates fell significantly thereafter, and the condition remains relatively rare today. However, occasional cases still occur, with some recent ones being tied to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735675722005071" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735675722005071" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bromide-containing dietary supplements that people purchased online&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the man's recent case, he'd been reading about the negative health effects of consuming too much table salt, also called sodium chloride. "He was surprised that he could only find literature related to reducing sodium from one's diet," as opposed to reducing chloride, the report noted. "Inspired by his history of studying nutrition in college, he decided to conduct a personal experiment to eliminate chloride from his diet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Note that chloride is important for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24019-electrolyte-imbalance" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24019-electrolyte-imbalance" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;maintaining healthy blood volume and blood pressure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and health issues can emerge if chloride levels in the blood &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?ContentTypeID=167&amp;amp;ContentID=chloride" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?ContentTypeID=167&amp;amp;ContentID=chloride" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;become too low or too high&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient consulted ChatGPT — either ChatGPT 3.5 or 4.0, based on the timeline of the case. The report authors didn't get access to the patient's conversation log, so the exact wording that the large language model (LLM) generated is unknown. But the man reported that ChatGPT said chloride can be swapped for bromide, so he swapped all the sodium chloride in his diet with sodium bromide. The authors noted that this swap likely works in the context of using sodium bromide for cleaning, rather than dietary use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to simulate what might have happened with their patient, the man's doctors tried asking ChatGPT 3.5 what chloride can be replaced with, and they also got a response that included bromide. The LLM did note that "context matters," but it neither provided a specific health warning nor sought more context about why the question was being asked, "as we presume a medical professional would do," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-67532682-9d07-4ce6-9c09-069462d211fe" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="recovering-from-bromism-3"&gt;Recovering from bromism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="b656ee7f-f5de-402e-bcb4-aca3b701b99e"&gt;After three months of consuming sodium bromide instead of table salt, the man reported to the emergency department with concerns that his neighbor was poisoning him. His labs at the time showed a buildup of carbon dioxide in his blood, as well as a rise in alkalinity (the opposite of acidity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also appeared to have elevated levels of chloride in his blood but normal sodium levels. Upon further investigation, this turned out to be a case of "pseudohyperchloremia," meaning the lab test for chloride gave a false result because other compounds in the blood — namely, large amounts of bromide — had interfered with the measurement. After consulting the medical literature and Poison Control, the man's doctors determined the most likely diagnosis was bromism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-less-accurate-than-a-coin-toss-at-medical-diagnosis-new-study-finds" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-less-accurate-than-a-coin-toss-at-medical-diagnosis-new-study-finds"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT is truly awful at diagnosing medical conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being admitted for electrolyte monitoring and repletion, the man said he was very thirsty but was paranoid about the water he was offered. After a full day in the hospital, his paranoia intensified and he began experiencing hallucinations. He then tried to escape the hospital, which resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold, during which he started receiving &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a694015.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a694015.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;an antipsychotic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man's vitals stabilized after he was given fluids and electrolytes, and as his mental state improved on the antipsychotic, he was able to inform the doctors about his use of ChatGPT. He also noted additional symptoms he'd noticed recently, such as facial acne and small red growths on his skin, which could be a hypersensitivity reaction to the bromide. He also noted insomnia, fatigue, muscle coordination issues and excessive thirst, "further suggesting bromism," his doctors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was tapered off the antipsychotic medication over the course of three weeks and then discharged from the hospital. He remained stable at a check-in two weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While it is a tool with much potential to provide a bridge between scientists and the nonacademic population, AI also carries the risk for promulgating decontextualized information," the report authors concluded. "It is highly unlikely that a medical expert would have mentioned sodium bromide when faced with a patient looking for a viable substitute for sodium chloride."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3ec76a9d-604d-42d3-954b-907c9363d997"&gt;They emphasized that, "as the use of AI tools increases, providers will need to consider this when screening for where their patients are consuming health information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the concerns raised by the case report, a different group of scientists &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_5003716623671526018&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43856-025-01021-3&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Ffood-diet%2Fman-sought-diet-advice-from-chatgpt-and-ended-up-with-bromide-intoxication" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-01021-3" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43856-025-01021-3&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Ffood-diet%2Fman-sought-diet-advice-from-chatgpt-and-ended-up-with-bromide-intoxication" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recently tested six LLMs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including ChatGPT, by having the models interpret clinical notes written by doctors. They found that LLMs are "highly susceptible to adversarial hallucination attacks," meaning they often generate "false clinical details that pose risks when used without safeguards." Applying engineering fixes can reduce the rate of errors but does not eliminate them, the researchers found. This highlights another way in which LLMs could introduce risks into medical decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-jykgnzHdRz2jQTbn8sfNwS-MDmzy6EjtXN5ufalnkBk1wEsST0tlPiz" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-jykgnzHdRz2jQTbn8sfNwS-MDmzy6EjtXN5ufalnkBk1wEsST0tlPiz slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical or dietary advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;For people with diabetes, high blood sugar can damage blood vessels and nerves, leading to chronic wounds that stay open for months. But a new gel-based treatment could massively speed up the healing process for people with diabetes, allowing wounds to close in just days, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new treatment targets thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a protein that inhibits the growth of new blood vessels, a crucial step in the healing process. Targeting this protein increased new blood vessel formation in human endothelial cells and in diabetic mouse models, leading to a remarkable wound closure rate in less than two weeks. A team of researchers from various institutes in China unveiled the new technology in a study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/burnstrauma/advance-article/doi/10.1093/burnst/tkaf036/8161322"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Burns &amp;amp; Trauma&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our results demonstrate the power of combining advanced tissue engineering with molecular biology. By targeting TSP-1 with miR-221OE-sEVs encapsulated in GelMA, we’ve not only improved endothelial cell function but also ensured a sustained and localized therapeutic effect,” Chuan’an Shen, a researcher at The Fourth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250807233035.htm"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Diabetic wounds have increased levels of TSP-1 in endothelial cells, the cells that line blood vessels, according to previous studies. TSP-1 hinders their ability to divide and go where they need to go. The study researchers developed a way to decrease levels of TSP-1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The technology uses small extracellular vesicles (sEVs)—teeny membrane-bound sacs usually released by cells—loaded with miR-221-3p, a microRNA that disrupts the production of TSP-1 in endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers encapsulated these sEVs in a hydrogel, which mimics the extracellular environment and provides a sustained, controlled release of miR-221-3p at the wound site. In diabetic mouse models, the gel significantly accelerated healing, leading to a 90% wound closure rate within 12 days—compared to just 20% in untreated mice over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The next steps are to bring the new gel into clinical trials, according to the authors. “This breakthrough could revolutionize how we approach diabetic wound care, with the potential to improve patients’ quality of life significantly,” Shen said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. provided only a brief explanation for the decision earlier this week, arguing the mRNA vaccines are not effective and not as safe as alternatives, and referencing a review of scientific research on mRNA by “experts,” without identifying them. On Friday, when asked if the Department of Health and Human Services had a scientific justification, a spokesperson provided a link to a 181-page &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/records/15787612" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;list of studies&lt;/a&gt; compiled by a number of people, including a current Trump administration adviser who served in the president’s first administration and was the subject of controversy for pushing unproven Covid-19 treatments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other contributors are people who have all previously criticized Covid-19 public health interventions, such as lockdowns and mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the studies cited generally appear to advance research that has been disputed by other scientists, who argue that mRNA vaccines are overwhelmingly safe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list appears to have been initially used as research for the publication of a 2024 book titled “Toxic Shot: Facing the Dangers of the COVID ‘Vaccines.’” A note at the top of the document said the list had last been updated on July 1. One of the named authors of the book, Byram Bridle, is among the individuals who compiled the citation list that HHS sent to STAT.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Another person credited on the list is HHS adviser &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/04/hatfill-covid-hydroxychloroquine-anthrax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Steven Hatfill&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist who was criticized during Trump’s first administration  in the first administration for recommending hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment, despite a lack of evidence to show its effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a video announcement Tuesday, Kennedy said he was directing the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, better known as BARDA, to begin canceling 22 grants &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/05/mrna-vaccine-development-canceled-by-kennedy-hhs/"&gt;supporting development of mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, totaling $500 million in research. Instead, he said, the administration would support research using a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/03/nih-500-million-univeral-flu-vaccine-project-uses-old-technology/"&gt;whole killed virus approach&lt;/a&gt; to develop vaccines. That approach has been advanced by the deputy director of the National Institutes of Health, Matthew Memoli, and the acting director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Jeffery Taubenberger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The announcement alarmed many public health experts, who say that mRNA vaccine technology, first used to develop Covid vaccines, saved countless lives during the pandemic in part because it can be used to deliver shots far faster than other approaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list shared by HHS includes references to a number of studies purportedly showing that, by training the immune system to recognize spike proteins produced by a Covid-19 infection, the spike protein produced by an mRNA vaccine is “harmful by itself, independent of the rest of the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other Covid vaccines that don’t use mRNA technology also train the immune system to detect and protect against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. And any individual who has been infected with Covid will have encountered the spike protein as well.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Beyond Hatfill, the list’s contributors include Martin Wucher, a dentist based in Namibia, who was described in media reports as a onetime member of &lt;a href="https://www.namibian.com.na/health-legal-professions-unhappy-with-govt-over-covid-19-handling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Health Defence League&lt;/a&gt;, a group that criticized Covid lockdowns in the African country, as well as Bridle, a viral immunologist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another contributor, Erik Sass, who has also argued hydroxychloroquine is an effective Covid treatment, told STAT via email that the list is “general reference for interested researchers,” and it originated as a supplement to the book co-authored by Bridle. That book includes a foreword by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), who has &lt;a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.05.21-Chair-Johnson-Opening-Statement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;invited vaccine critics to Capitol Hill&lt;/a&gt; previously to testify on the safety of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;So many people in western countries are turning to weight loss drugs such as Wegovy/Ozempic and Mounjaro that concerns have &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/weight-loss-drug-demand-continues-to-grow-in-the-uk-heres-whats-being-done-to-keep-supplies-readily-available-262065"&gt;started to emerge&lt;/a&gt; about maintaining ready supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with popularity comes scrutiny, and rising demand isn't the only potential problem with weight loss jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gastrointestinal side-effects such as nausea, vomiting and constipation are common across these drugs, which are known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. Then there's the now infamous "&lt;a href="https://www.jprasurg.com/article/S1748-6815(23)00214-0/abstract"&gt;Ozempic face&lt;/a&gt;" – a gaunt, aged appearance that can result from rapid weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-type-drugs-may-trigger-brain-changes-linked-to-depression"&gt;Ozempic-Type Drugs May Trigger Brain Changes Linked to Depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163853" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/chewing_gum_ozempic_642.jpg" alt="Weight-Loss Drugs Like Ozempic Can Leave Lasting Damage in Your Mouth" class="wp-image-163853 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/chewing_gum_ozempic_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/chewing_gum_ozempic_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163853" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;These drugs can also leave you with a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-can-leave-lasting-damage-in-your-mouth"&gt;dry mouth&lt;/a&gt;. Chewing gum can help. (Eva-Katalin/Getty Images Signature/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;More serious concerns have also begun to surface, including possible links to &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14740338.2024.2419989"&gt;eye disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12144364/"&gt;reduced libido&lt;/a&gt; and a potential increased risk of certain cancers. However, we're still in the early days of understanding what the risks might be and the evidence for them is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant cancer-related worry is thyroid  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="170682" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Studies in rodents found that high doses of GLP-1 drugs caused thyroid tumors, although this &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.927859/full"&gt;hasn't been definitively proven in humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, a &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/46/2/384/147888/GLP-1-Receptor-Agonists-and-the-Risk-of-Thyroid"&gt;large-scale French study&lt;/a&gt; did find a potential link between GLP-1 use and thyroid cancer, especially in patients who used the drug for more than a year. As a precaution, these medications are not recommended for people with a personal or family history of thyroid cancer or specific genetic conditions that increase the risk of thyroid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have also been concerns about pancreatic cancer, mostly because of early reports of pancreatitis: inflammation of the pancreas, which can, in some cases, be fatal. However, current studies have not confirmed a direct link between GLP-1 drugs and pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns here are particularly relevant because of how the drugs work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-viral-cause-of-one-of-the-worlds-most-common-cancers"&gt;Scientists Discover a Viral Cause of One of The World's Most Common Cancers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wegovy and Ozempic are brand names for a type of GLP-1 receptor agonist known as semaglutide. Originally developed to treat type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170682" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, it works by activating receptors in the pancreas to increase insulin release and reduce glucagon – a hormone that raises blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these effects help lower blood-sugar levels. The weight loss effects come from the drug's ability to act on &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/63/12/4186/40422/GLP-1-Receptor-Activation-Modulates-Appetite-and"&gt;receptors in the brain&lt;/a&gt; as well as in &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/60/5/1561/33533/Rapid-Tachyphylaxis-of-the-Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1"&gt;gut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(20)61128-0/fulltext"&gt;fat cells&lt;/a&gt;, to help to reduce appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mounjaro (the brand name for the compound tirzepatide) takes things a step further. It works not only on the GLP-1 receptor but also on a second one – the GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) receptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By stimulating both, tirzepatide &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/106/2/388/6000489"&gt;boosts the pancreas's ability to produce insulin&lt;/a&gt; and improves insulin sensitivity – meaning the body's cells respond more effectively to insulin, helping regulate blood sugar more efficiently. This &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12982-024-00200-2"&gt;dual action&lt;/a&gt; results in even greater weight loss than semaglutide alone, making Mounjaro the latest star in the fight against obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tirzepatide has not been associated with increased cancer risk in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="170682" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; so far. However, like other GLP-1 drugs, it still carries the thyroid cancer warning based on earlier animal research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, preliminary studies in animals suggest tirzepatide might even &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/oncology-times/fulltext/2024/07000/tirzepatide__weight_loss_treatment_shows_promise.22.aspx?context=latestarticles&amp;amp;casa_token=oXuRRSYN6rkAAAAA:mpuDWTwDhd2nDND16AvRXkfITcSC8YGg0b0cxpPHlnBH4JmnK06U7P03gIIw70JlBK6F6_P9UE7tYWRSwISS4h-qMViEMg&amp;amp;casa_token=giULyz6VeZMAAAAA:hnyZdH9xXehdKQ4HLHQLm2pq-fD05S87AWphjZxPRZd8MA54bYLyMVDk3Evg9p3UxqkTgCEeH5xDeSNLvYrIcFw1J7dGUg"&gt;shrink certain tumors&lt;/a&gt;, including breast cancer, but these findings are still very early and not yet applicable to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169031" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WeightLoss.jpg" alt="Graph showing how your weight can bounce back once you stop Ozempic" class="wp-image-169031 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WeightLoss.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WeightLoss-488x415.jpg 488w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WeightLoss-600x510.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169031" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Weight &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-comes-back-when-you-stop-taking-drugs-like-ozempic-study-finds"&gt;tends to bounce back&lt;/a&gt; once you stop taking these drugs. (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-025-04200-0"&gt;Wu et al., &lt;em&gt;BMC Med.,&lt;/em&gt; 2025&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Obesity is also a cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to remember that obesity itself is a well established risk factor for several cancers, including breast, colon, liver and uterine cancers. By helping people lose significant amounts of weight and improve their metabolic health, GLP-1 drugs could indirectly reduce the risk of developing these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, some &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/17/1/78"&gt;population studies&lt;/a&gt; have found lower rates of obesity-related cancers in people using GLP-1 medications compared to those taking other treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's still unclear whether the reduced cancer risk comes from the drug's action or from the weight loss itself. More research is needed to fully understand this connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the current picture is reassuring, yet tinged with uncertainty. The overall cancer risk associated with GLP-1 drugs and tirzepatide appears to be low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's important to emphasize that these medications are not recommended for people with a personal or family history of certain types of &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/110/6/e2080/7821115?login=true#no-access-message#no-access-message"&gt;thyroid cancer, or also endocrine conditions&lt;/a&gt; such as multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome, because these conditions may increase sensitivity to hormone-related tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight-loss injections are not risk free, but they also hold enormous potential. It remains to be unraveled whether they're miracle cures or just the latest chapter in the long saga of weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain: the conversation is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs are rewriting the rules on how we think about weight, health, and risk. In the battle to outsmart the scales, they offer hope, science and a fair bit of gamble amidst the hype.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262146/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

The bacteria thrive in waters between 68 degrees Fahrenheit and 95 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius to 35 degrees Celsius).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These temperatures are becoming more common as the planet warms, and as ocean temperatures rise, Vibrio is spreading further north and remaining on coasts longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;V. vulnificus thrives in warm coastal waters, such as Florida Gulf Coast beaches. In Florida, 16 people have been infected and five have died&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Worsening storms and flooding are also washing the bacteria into freshwater, putting swimmers and seafood lovers at higher risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Florida's tally thus far falls short of the annual average of 48 cases and 11 deaths, in Louisiana, the state's averages for both have been dwarfed by the current figures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There have been 17 cases so far this year, including four deaths. By comparison, an average of seven V. vulnificus cases and one death have been reported each year in Louisiana &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/vibrio-vulnificus-2025"&gt;over the previous 10 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All 17 patients have been hospitalized, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas saw an average number of Vibrio cases of about 33 per year from 2015 to 2019, the latest year available. Annually, cases have fluctuated between 22 to 36. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2019 in Texas, Adam Perez, 42, was hospitalized and lost most of the flesh on the lower half of his right leg after a dangerous dip in Waters Edge Park in Corpus Christi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had to undergo four different life-saving surgeries, including skin grafts over his leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This is a very scary-sounding bacteria, Vibrio vulnificus. Fortunately, it is rare, but it can be very deadly,’ Dr Alok Patel, a pediatrician at Stanford Children's Health, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/deadly-flesh-eating-bacteria-cases-rise-gulf-coast/story?id=124296398"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;The CDC map shows cases of V. vulnificus in 2019, when the US reported a total of 194 cases. The bacteria typically populates the waters off the Gulf Coast, but the map shows that it has slowly made its way northward &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vibrio kills, on average, 20 percent of its victims, though in people with compromised immune systems, that figure jumps to at least 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, when it causes sepsis or necrotizing fasciitis, the risk of death climbs to 70 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 80 percent of people who become infected contract it from contact with seawater, while 20 percent of infections are caused by consumption of raw seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 150 to 200 V. vulnificus infections are reported to the CDC each year and trends suggest cases are rising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A sweeping review of CDC data from 1988 to 2018 revealed that Vibrio wound infections on the East Coast surged eightfold, from about 10 to over 80 cases per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rachel Noble, a microbiologist at UNC-Chapel Hill’s Institute of Marine Sciences, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://college.unc.edu/inthemedia/flesh-eating-bacteria/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘Every water sample we collect along the [North Carolina] coast now contains some kind of Vibrio. That wasn’t true two decades ago.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When V. vulnificus is not fatal, it still can leave lifelong complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it enters a wound, the bacteria proliferate quickly and release toxins that tear tissue and blood vessels apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After Adam Perez stuck his toes into some water at a Corpus Christi park, his foot and leg swelled enormously and a giant blister formed, due to vibriosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Perez had strolled into Waters Edge Park in Corpus Christi and dipped his toes into some water there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection can penetrate deeper layers of the skin, muscle, and bloodstream in a matter of hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From there, the skin develops blisters and open sores.

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-cases-rise-summer-2025-cdc-data/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;summer surge of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; doesn't appear to be slowing down — instead, a key indicator for tracking the spread of the virus has increased, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;In an update&lt;/a&gt; shared Friday, official data showed wastewater activity for COVID-19 is now at a "moderate" level nationwide, up from "low" the previous week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wastewater levels for the virus are currently the highest in the Western U.S., the data also showed. States in this region showing high levels include: Alaska, California, Colorado, Nevada and Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wastewater monitoring can detect viruses spreading from one person to another within a community earlier than clinical testing and before people who are sick go to their doctor or hospital," the CDC notes. "If you see increased wastewater viral activity levels, it might indicate that there is a higher risk of infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other metrics are also showing increases in the illness. As of Tuesday, the CDC estimates COVID-19 infections are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/rt-estimates/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;growing or likely growing in 45 states&lt;/a&gt;, which is up from 40 states last week. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although the weekly percentage of emergency room visits for COVID-19 is overall low — compared to the week before, ER visits for the infection &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_percent-covid-ed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;have also risen&lt;/a&gt; from last week.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the nation saw the number of COVID cases increase last month, CBS News chief medical correspondent &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-cases-rise-summer-2025-cdc-data/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Dr. Jon LaPook told "CBS Mornings"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that this is typical of what we've come to understand about summer spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We now know that there's a winter spike and then there's a summer spike," he said at the time. "And every year, the number of deaths, the number of hospitalizations, is gradually going down each season. So that's the good news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, people shouldn't ignore the increases, he said, adding if it strikes — especially those vulnerable like the elderly, young people and those immunocompromised — as they can still get really sick. &lt;/p&gt;

				Conscientiousness levels among young adults have &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5cd77ef0-b546-4105-8946-36db3f84dc43"&gt;fallen substantially since 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; as people in their twenties and thirties report increased distractibility and carelessness alongside decreased tenacity and commitment-making, according to Financial Times analysis of Understanding America Study data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The personality trait, which research links to longer lifespans, career success, and relationship durability, has witnessed its steepest decline during and after the pandemic. Young adults simultaneously showed rising neuroticism scores and declining extroversion measures, transforming from society's most outgoing age group to its most introverted.

People can experience a range of symptoms with MS, including vision problems, muscle weakness, tingling in the arms and legs, and muscle spasms, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/multiple-sclerosis" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/multiple-sclerosis" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke&lt;/a&gt; (NINDS).

Meaning, you can feel lousy overall or in a lot of areas, making it hard for doctors (and you) to pin down what could be behind this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;People with MS can also struggle with fatigue, which can be a tough symptom to tie to any one condition, Sachdev says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Symptoms like pain, mood changes, and fatigue tend to be linked more to an MS diagnosis after it's made, because they can be due to a range of health conditions, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clifford Segil," data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.1.0"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. He says he tends to discover these symptoms when he looks back at patient’s health history after an MS diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-should-you-do-if-youre-having-these-symptoms" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;What should you do if you’re having these symptoms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Doctors say it’s a stretch to suggest that you should assume you have MS if you’re only dealing with fatigue or mood changes. But Sachdev says you also shouldn’t brush off symptoms that just don’t quit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Health is deeply personal. To manage it, you need to begin with a provider that connects with you,” he says. “Ideally, you would begin with a single observation or concern that is bothersome. Focusing on this issue with that provider is the place to start.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But Segil stresses the importance of seeing a specialist if you’re dealing with several symptoms you really can’t explain. “Whenever you have a constellation of symptoms which are without a clear medical diagnosis, seeing a neurologist may be wise,” he says. They can help take a careful assessment of your health history, along with ordering testing, to see what could be going on. &lt;br data-node-id="21.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

The study advocates eating more, not fewer eggs than have been recommended in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Jon Buckley, the lead researcher and a professor at the university, said the research team was able to unscramble the effects of cholesterol and saturated fat, “finding that high dietary cholesterol from eggs, when eaten as part of a low saturated fat diet, does not raise bad cholesterol levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Saturated fat, he said, drives elevation of bad cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;This is not the first study to suggest that the long-held view that eggs are potentially harmful exaggerated the risk. Dr. Howard LeWine, editor of Harvard Men’s Health Watch, in 2022 disputed advice to eat no more than one or two whole eggs a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“More recent research found that dietary cholesterol had little influence on blood levels of total and ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol,” he wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/how-many-eggs-can-i-safely-eat" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/how-many-eggs-can-i-safely-eat"&gt;Harvard newsletter.&lt;/a&gt; “Instead, it is dietary saturated fats that raise these blood levels. The reason? Most of the cholesterol in your body does not come from your diet but is made by your liver. And saturated fat in the diet can cause your liver to make lots of cholesterol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Conflicting-findings" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Conflicting findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-many-eggs-should-you-eat#cholesterol-levels" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-many-eggs-should-you-eat#cholesterol-levels"&gt;Healthline reports&lt;/a&gt; that the risk from eating eggs likely varies some depending on the person and notes that there are conflicting studies, which suggests more research is needed on the topic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“For a healthy adult with normal cholesterol levels and no significant underlying heart disease risk factors, some research suggests that 1–2 eggs per day can be safe. It may even be healthy and benefit your heart health," the article said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;As for trying to limit potential risks by skipping the yolk and only eating egg whites, Healthline says that misses some of the goodness contained in the yolk: iron, vitamin D and carotenoids, among others. “These bioactive nutrients are thought to be responsible for many of the health-promoting qualities of eggs, like reduced inflammation, increased HDL cholesterol levels, and improved metabolic health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 17:07:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxObVV0SFkwdHlLS3FqbjJubnVVZWVHLXlYRUJiS2h0SFQ5eXVVbTBWQVFsUWkzYjFnR1gzOTF3M3AyVTVFbVZzM0RxcTZOUzRDcTROVy0zcXltUlBxT04tSGZUSXM1MXROdnB6M1JBQ0tWbHdrS0N2dGkwb21qanZLajBSYkNxRm8zSU1OeHhMbUJFRUpnRmJKZzFhYS10cVpMSHl4X3VoWkxJS2s</guid></item><item><title>营养师推荐的6种最佳代谢综合征蔬菜- EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE50cjRYd1Vsa0JkcDZzOHFnQW5XUlA3VS1PWktGenBDYWFWWjFCMUZwUEJrVkpLdlNVcVZ3VXVpeG1mTHZ3enBJQzM3TWMwTm9YY3VDbVNEczBvWms3cVl4LVctQ2h1dkVUMzFOQS1WRTUyNFpKWmlVQWFNR2JQXzQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Metabolic syndrome, also referred to as insulin resistance syndrome, is a cluster of conditions that heighten the risk of diabetes, coronary heart disease and other health issues. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, about 1 in 3 U.S. adults have this condition.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While metabolic syndrome is prevalent in the U.S., fortunately, it may be preventable through making healthy lifestyle changes. Some of the best ways to support metabolic health include regularly exercising, maintaining a healthy weight and eating nutrient-dense foods.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vegetables, along with fruits, are the primary food source of antioxidants and polyphenols, which have been linked to better insulin, blood and glucose levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, vegetables contain limited sodium and saturated fat, which are known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vegetables are also beneficial for people with metabolic syndrome due to their vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. These foods are also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-foods-for-diabetes-11737675" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in fiber, which helps regulate blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; and improve insulin sensitivity.

While variety is key to getting adequate nutrients, focusing on the vegetables you like most will help increase your intake of fiber—which plays a massive role in reducing caloric intake and cholesterol levels.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rather than implementing a new eating plan, adding these vegetables to your rotation one day at a time can be easier. Explore these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057241/top-high-fiber-foods-you-need-in-your-life/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; that support healthy blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Aside from eating the vegetables for metabolic syndrome listed above, here are other ways to boost your metabolic function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Get Adequate Sleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Quality sleep is essential for overall health. One study suggests that sleep duration can affect metabolic systems.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Metabolic syndrome severity scores, used to assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, were higher among subjects who slept less than seven hours daily. Always aim to get seven to nine hours of rest at night.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mindful eating is essential when managing metabolic syndrome. Being mindful of portions and food choices can help you reduce the risk of other related diseases. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Start by cultivating awareness of nutritional parameters. To help lower the risk of diabetes, strive for a moderate carbohydrate intake per meal—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/our-food-and-nutrition-philosophy-6746110" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;30 to 60 grams or three to four carbohydrate servings/counts&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, follow the recommendation of the American Heart Association to aim for a dietary pattern that achieves only 5% to 6% of calories from saturated fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The artist likely noticed the tree root-like branching structure, and he theorized that the trabeculae were like the systems we use now to keep sidewalks and roads from freezing: a network for &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a61207150/young-blood-transfusions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;, in this case, that was kept warm by circulating in small vessels around the warm and vibrant heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;The heart and its trabeculae, first described by Leonardo da Vinci.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Spencer Phillips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studying the trabeculae, scientists were able to identify common features across different patient imagery and to begin to draw conclusions about what the structural trabeculae are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using biomechanical simulations and observational data from human participants, we demonstrate that trabecular morphology is an important determinant of cardiac performance,” for example, meaning certain trabecular structures meant an increased risk of cardiovascular &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a65398598/beating-cell-death-with-anti-necrotics/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified 16 significant loci that contain genes associated with haemodynamic phenotypes and regulation of cytoskeletal arborization,” the researchers explain. By studying the genome as well as trabeculae of their tens of thousands of subjects, they began to pinpoint places in the genome that spoke to how trabeculae are able to form and function—with implications about the way other body cells form and behave as well.

The findings could help explain why ME/CFS patients often &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/viral-origins-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-may-be-hiding-in-plain-sight"&gt;report an infection&lt;/a&gt; before their first symptoms, and why numbers have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-has-surged-since-the-pandemic-study-reveals"&gt;surged since the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"DecodeME's results, grounded in the principles of statistical genetics, now place ME/CFS research on a firm biological foundation," &lt;a href="https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/initial-findings-from-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt; the DecodeME team of more than 50 researchers. This "should help to reduce the stigma of the illness," they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuropsychiatrist Alan Carson from the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-unpublished-preprint-on-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-of-me-cfs/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it is "by someway the largest study ever conducted on genetics of CFS/ME."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DecodeME's analysis brought together more than 16,000 patients, most of whom are female and of European descent. The criteria for diagnosis was stringent so that only the most clear-cut cases were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients must have had an official diagnosis of ME/CFS as well as a key symptom, called post-exertional malaise, which essentially translates to undue fatigue following exercise or other energy-consuming activities, including concentrating or socializing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed over a dozen genetic signals linked to ME/CFS, but only eight could be replicated in a second dataset, including more than 13,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third dataset of more than 14,000 cases failed to reproduce the results. This may have been due to differences in how ME/CFS was defined and diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these eight genome-wide associations are not exclusive to those with ME/CFS, the findings suggest that they are more likely to occur in those with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the eight gene signals were expressed in brain tissue, including the ones associated with pain and the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Drugs targeting these genes' proteins might help protect against the consequences of microbial infection and therefore could reduce the risk of acquiring ME/CFS," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/initial-findings-from-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signals are modest, and we don't yet know what they mean. While there are limitations to the research, University of Hertfordshire geneticist Alena Pance, who was also not involved in the study, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-unpublished-preprint-on-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-of-me-cfs/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the study is a "great advance towards understanding the illness better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while Carson agrees the research is important, he sees a long road ahead. Carson &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-unpublished-preprint-on-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-of-me-cfs/"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that in disorders like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="170470" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, finding a few associated genes has not advanced our understanding of the disease or improved treatments just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, important strides are being made with the help of patients. Ponting and his team argue that their recent findings help explain the heritable component of ME/CFS, improve the likelihood of finding effective drugs, and place the disease on more equal terms with other common genetic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've gone from knowing almost nothing about the causes of ME to having specific genetic information to delve much deeper into," &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0S5u88qpVc4"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; study contributor Sonya Chowdhury, the CEO of UK health charity, Action for ME.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For decades people with ME have asked to be heard, and now science is catching up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is available via preprint &lt;a href="https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/initial-findings-from-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

And yet, stomachaches are not typically a sign of this rare form of cancer at any point in its progression. Instead, the most common feature of the early stages of stomach cancer is that there are no symptoms at all, said &lt;a href="https://findadoc.bidmc.org/details/5623/umut-sarpel-surgery-boston" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://findadoc.bidmc.org/details/5623/umut-sarpel-surgery-boston" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Umut Sarpel, M.D." data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Umut Sarpel, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the chief of the division of surgical oncology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"We all get stomachaches from time to time, and that can make people worry about stomach cancer," Dr. Sarpel said. "But it's not one of the most common cancers, and in most cases, stomachaches or pain are not going to be the result of cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="body-tip css-1707dxl emevuu60"&gt;Meet the expert: &lt;a href="https://findadoc.bidmc.org/details/5623/umut-sarpel-surgery-boston" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://findadoc.bidmc.org/details/5623/umut-sarpel-surgery-boston" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Umut Sarpel, M.D." data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Umut Sarpel, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the chief of the division of surgical oncology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;So what are the signs of stomach cancer? When it causes any, they are typically one of these six digestive problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="there-is-blood-in-your-vomit-or-stool" data-node-id="5" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;There is blood in your vomit or stool.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While both colitis and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a26024642/crohns-disease-symptoms-causes-treatments/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a26024642/crohns-disease-symptoms-causes-treatments/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Crohn's disease" data-node-id="6.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;/a&gt; can cause bloody stool, it can also be a sign of cancer. Regardless, blood in either your poop or your vomit demands a visit to a GI doctor, Dr. Sarpel said. If the bleeding is related to cancer, the blood in your stool is likely to look maroon or tarry black. "It looks that way because it's been acted on by your digestive enzymes," she explained. If the blood is in your vomit, it's more likely to look bright red, and it may have a coarse "coffee grounds" texture because it has been partially digested, Dr. Sarpel added. &lt;br data-node-id="6.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-feel-full-after-just-a-few-bites" data-node-id="7" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;You feel full after just a few bites.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You were definitely hungry when you sat down to eat. But after a few bites, your appetite vanishes and the food isn't appealing. Dr. Sarpel called this "early satiety," and says it's another symptom that could—emphasis on &lt;em data-node-id="8.1"&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;—indicate stomach cancer. "Especially if feeling full really quickly is different than what you're used to, that's something you shouldn't ignore," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-have-constant-gnawing-stomach-pain" data-node-id="9" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;You have constant, gnawing stomach pain.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Yes, in some cases stomach pain is a sign of stomach cancer. But in most cases, your run-of-the-mill pain or stomach cramps are going to be the result of some other gut or abdominal ailment, not cancer, Dr. Sarpel said. If it is a result of cancer, the pain will be a consistent gnawing in the middle of your stomach, she added. "It's not something you feel for one day, and then it goes away for two weeks and comes back again." &lt;br data-node-id="10.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-lost-weight-without-trying" data-node-id="11" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;You lost weight without trying.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Many health conditions—including &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a65158472/new-treatment-type-1-diabetes-cure/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a65158472/new-treatment-type-1-diabetes-cure/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="type 1 diabetes" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, Addison's disease, and Crohn's disease—can lead to unexplained weight loss. Add stomach cancer to that list, Dr. Sarpel said. "If you're losing weight and not dieting, that's something to pay attention to," she explained. Be aware that the weight loss may be gradual. While you may not notice a sudden drop, you might step on a scale and find you've lost 10 pounds during the last 6 months. It is totally natural for your weight to fluctuate, but if the weight loss is noticeable and you haven't been doing anything that accounts for it, talk with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-have-frequent-unexplained-heartburn" data-node-id="13" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;You have frequent, unexplained heartburn.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a39761688/heartburn-relief/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a39761688/heartburn-relief/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Heartburn" data-node-id="14.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Heartburn&lt;/a&gt;, indigestion, and other common symptoms of an unhappy gut can also be early warning signs of stomach cancer, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancer-types/stomach-cancer/stomach-cancer-symptoms.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancer-types/stomach-cancer/stomach-cancer-symptoms.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas" data-node-id="14.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Again, Dr. Sarpel said these sorts of symptoms are much more likely to be something &lt;em data-node-id="14.4"&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than cancer. But it’s still a good idea to let your doctor know what’s going on, especially if they are constant and don't seem to be caused by consumption of specific foods and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-experience-regular-bloating-diarrhea-and-constipation" data-node-id="15" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;You experience regular bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It makes sense that a cancer growing in your stomach could make you feel bloated, or mess with your bowel movements.

And yet, stomachaches are not typically a sign of this rare form of cancer at any point in its progression. Instead, the most common feature of the early stages of stomach cancer is that there are no symptoms at all, said &lt;a href="https://findadoc.bidmc.org/details/5623/umut-sarpel-surgery-boston" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Umut Sarpel, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Umut Sarpel, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the chief of the division of surgical oncology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We all get stomachaches from time to time, and that can make people worry about stomach cancer," Dr. Sarpel said. "But it's not one of the most common cancers, and in most cases, stomachaches or pain are not going to be the result of cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the expert: &lt;a href="https://findadoc.bidmc.org/details/5623/umut-sarpel-surgery-boston" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Umut Sarpel, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Umut Sarpel, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the chief of the division of surgical oncology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are the signs of stomach cancer? When it causes any, they are typically one of these six digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;There is blood in your vomit or stool.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both colitis and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a26024642/crohns-disease-symptoms-causes-treatments/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Crohn's disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;/a&gt; can cause bloody stool, it can also be a sign of cancer. Regardless, blood in either your poop or your vomit demands a visit to a GI doctor, Dr. Sarpel said. If the bleeding is related to cancer, the blood in your stool is likely to look maroon or tarry black. "It looks that way because it's been acted on by your digestive enzymes," she explained. If the blood is in your vomit, it's more likely to look bright red, and it may have a coarse "coffee grounds" texture because it has been partially digested, Dr. Sarpel added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You feel full after just a few bites.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You were definitely hungry when you sat down to eat. But after a few bites, your appetite vanishes and the food isn't appealing. Dr. Sarpel called this "early satiety," and says it's another symptom that could—emphasis on &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;—indicate stomach cancer. "Especially if feeling full really quickly is different than what you're used to, that's something you shouldn't ignore," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You have constant, gnawing stomach pain.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, in some cases stomach pain is a sign of stomach cancer. But in most cases, your run-of-the-mill pain or stomach cramps are going to be the result of some other gut or abdominal ailment, not cancer, Dr. Sarpel said. If it is a result of cancer, the pain will be a consistent gnawing in the middle of your stomach, she added. "It's not something you feel for one day, and then it goes away for two weeks and comes back again." &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You lost weight without trying.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many health conditions—including &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a65158472/new-treatment-type-1-diabetes-cure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 1 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, Addison's disease, and Crohn's disease—can lead to unexplained weight loss. Add stomach cancer to that list, Dr. Sarpel said. "If you're losing weight and not dieting, that's something to pay attention to," she explained. Be aware that the weight loss may be gradual. While you may not notice a sudden drop, you might step on a scale and find you've lost 10 pounds during the last 6 months. It is totally natural for your weight to fluctuate, but if the weight loss is noticeable and you haven't been doing anything that accounts for it, talk with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You have frequent, unexplained heartburn.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a39761688/heartburn-relief/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Heartburn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Heartburn&lt;/a&gt;, indigestion, and other common symptoms of an unhappy gut can also be early warning signs of stomach cancer, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancer-types/stomach-cancer/stomach-cancer-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

The underlying philosophy is that doctors can identify and treat the root causes of infertility, often with less invasive and more affordable methods than IVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4e3993" class="body-graf"&gt;But restorative reproductive medicine isn’t formally recognized as a medical specialty in the U.S. and has not been evaluated as extensively as IVF has. Many fertility doctors worry that holistic methods are being presented to patients as a better alternative to IVF, thereby denying patients access to a proven option in fertility care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e39843" class="body-graf"&gt;“Restorative approaches may work for certain patients, but elevating them as morally superior or universally preferable undermines the individualized, evidence-based care modern reproductive medicine is built on,” said Dr. Brian Levine, the founding partner of CCRM Fertility of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-e7e26c"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1467" data-original-width="2200"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg" alt="President Trump Signs Executive Orders At Mar-a-Lago In Palm Beach, Florida"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;President Donald Trump delivers remarks after signing an executive order on access to IVF at Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 18,  in Palm Beach, Fla.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Joe Raedle / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b2ff4" class="body-graf"&gt;After Trump issued an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/expanding-access-to-in-vitro-fertilization/" target="_blank"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; in February promising to make IVF more affordable and attainable, Republican lawmakers introduced companion bills in the House and Senate that would expand access to restorative reproductive medicine and prohibit discrimination against providers who don’t offer IVF. And in June, Arkansas became the first state to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/05/infertility-treatment-restorative-reproductive-medicine-explained/" target="_blank"&gt;require insurance companies&lt;/a&gt; to cover restorative reproductive medicine treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e94159" class="body-graf"&gt;Recent actions out of the Department of Health and Human Services suggest an aligned interest in holistic fertility methods.

Dr. Kaylen Silverberg, an adviser to that council and a fertility specialist at Texas Fertility Center, said he recommended to White House officials that they declare infertility an essential health benefit under the Affordable Care Act and cover IVF services for military and government employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-14abad" class="body-graf"&gt;But The Washington Post &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/08/03/trump-administration-ivf-care/" target="_blank"&gt;reported Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that the White House does not plan to require health insurers to cover IVF services, a policy Trump previously said he would implement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca500f" class="body-graf"&gt;Silverberg said White House officials haven’t told him which policies they favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d300f4" class="body-graf"&gt;“They come at me with very insightful questions, but they don’t give me anything,” he said. “If I say to them, ‘Hey, what are you thinking about such and such?’ The pat answer that I get back is, ‘Well, we’re listening to lots of different sources, and we’re trying to formulate the best solutions that we can.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5438b" class="body-graf"&gt;The White House said it has met with stakeholders across the spectrum to solicit their input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-742d81" class="body-graf"&gt;“President Trump pledged to expand IVF access for Americans looking to start families, and the Administration remains committed to delivering on that pledge and exploring all options that address the root causes of infertility,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3eb9af" class="body-graf"&gt;Restorative reproductive medicine may indeed be one of those options. The International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine, the professional association for doctors who offer this type of fertility care, has spoken with federal officials about its methods, said Dr. Tracey Parnell, the institute’s global director of communications and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c454f1" class="body-graf"&gt;Parnell, who is Canadian, coined the term “restorative reproductive medicine” in the late 1990s alongside a small group of international physicians. She was surprised earlier this year when her community became part of the national conversation in the U.S., she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2cb5ce" class="body-graf"&gt;“We were sort of expecting another decade to be able to get to the stage of more published information and further along the pathway to formal recognition as a specialty,” Parnell said, noting that such recognition in the U.S. requires accreditation by a national board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-563af9" class="body-graf"&gt;One group responsible for increasing the visibility of restorative reproductive medicine is the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank whose policy proposals are known to influence the White House’s agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-23e49c" class="body-graf"&gt;In March, the foundation &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/marriage-and-family/report/treating-infertility-the-new-frontier-reproductive-medicine" target="_blank"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; highlighting what it said are the benefits of restorative reproductive medicine over a fertility industry that “profits from the creation and selection of human life.” The report emboldened groups that are morally or ideologically opposed to IVF, said Levine, of CCRM Fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-47625d"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1466" data-original-width="2200"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg" alt="House Democrats Holds Press Conference On World IVF Day"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;People hold signs in honor of World IVF Day in Washington, D.C., in 2024. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Tierney L.

Kennedy Jr., also favor holistic methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-72efc0" class="body-graf"&gt;In late June, the Heritage Foundation and the MAHA Institute — a policy center that backs initiatives that align with the MAHA movement — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhlr3aVJKOQ" target="_blank"&gt;held a roundtable discussion&lt;/a&gt; on women’s fertility. Many of the speakers there advocated for restorative reproductive medicine and warned of the risks of hormonal birth control. At least one high-powered federal official, the Food and Drug Administration’s principal deputy commissioner, Sara Brenner, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apRJ9RpdTDc&amp;amp;t=151s" target="_blank"&gt;was in attendance&lt;/a&gt; and expressed support for the topics discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6c34b4" class="body-graf"&gt;“The goals of the Make America Health Again movement — to return to holistic, root-cause medical care for men and women — align with the goals and approach of restorative reproductive medicine, even if there are notable differences and distinctions between those two movements,” said Emma Waters, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f98f96" class="body-graf"&gt;Parnell, of the International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine, said the group’s methods don’t prevent people from pursuing IVF, but rather give them options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d812b8" class="body-graf"&gt;Practitioners of restorative reproductive medicine say their methods are individualized to the patient and don’t rush to diagnose women with infertility if they can’t conceive right away. They often ask patients to carefully track their menstrual cycles, body temperature and changes in cervical mucus to help determine when they’re ovulating. They also look to diagnose and treat medical conditions that may impact fertility, such as polycystic ovary syndrome or endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54d901" class="body-graf"&gt;Where necessary, practitioners may suggest changes to patients’ diets, recommend vitamins or supplements or prescribe hormone medications that improve ovulation. In some cases, they may advise surgery to diagnose endometriosis and remove scar tissue that can block an egg’s path to the uterus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7cee8e" class="body-graf"&gt;But IVF doctors said the restorative approach can take time&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; which some patients may not have if they have a diminished number or quality of eggs. Many of the tactics of restorative reproductive medicine, like prescribing hormones or dietary changes, are already used in fertility clinics nationwide, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7af863" class="body-graf"&gt;Silverberg, of Texas Fertility Center, said restorative reproductive medicine is “a made-up term for something that’s been going on for decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-adc35f" class="body-graf"&gt;“My concern is that the people who focus solely on restorative reproductive health want things to stop right there. They unfortunately advocate ignoring all of the medical advances that have happened in the last 40 years,” Silverberg said, adding that he shared these thoughts with White House officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fb1b25" class="body-graf"&gt;Monica Minjeur, the U.S. director of communications and development for the International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine, said there is data to show that the approach works. In a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2018.00210/full" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of more than 400 women with a history of infertility, most of whom had been unsuccessful with IVF, roughly 32% gave birth after turning to restorative reproductive medicine. The odds of having a child via an additional cycle of IVF were roughly the same, according to the paper, which Parnell co-authored. (The average &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4934614/" target="_blank"&gt;success rate of a woman’s first IVF cycle&lt;/a&gt; is around 30%.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-398e54" class="body-graf"&gt;Despite its conservative fan base, Minjeur said, restorative reproductive medicine is not inherently political or religious, and her organization is cautious about these associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5e17a9" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We are a science-based medical organization who is trying to just get the good word out to the people,” she said. “If and where that aligns with government priorities to help people who want to build families, great, we’ll take it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQRUYxekYxN0JTVzQyNk1aT0U0Wkk5YlJkcDlXeE0ySWNmYlZjTldCNkp1WXhMeksyUDFDZmNWcGxLN0g2aDg4d1MwcjFZY0dmUWdrRGtCNDV1eXAxdEpoWDhpbzFOUldtV2hqUVRPc0JiSXdwX2dJVC1PRkEzZFM1SDlJc1hHRGNTbFZGZ1VmZlh3RDRGT2JhRXRaN09MdFFzV1FwTmx4M0pCVTlfc0NDZFhqVFYzcXg4bjNLOExad9IBVkFVX3lxTFBHVTZoYVA5OWFxbldobG1rSUtLMFNUcTZxZDN1TVJFWkJLSlVZQzRWTy1CN2xZWl9aMWp2WGhUa1l0YlRUeDJPbUVuZElnekZwT092VDhR</guid></item><item><title>具有基因编辑细胞的糖尿病患者自行生产胰岛素-无需移植药物- Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxNRnZCcWIxSXBlaU54SG5zbVdib3RuOUxrM1lVMncwT1N5RldSdi13Ynk0WUwtVmtHYVlxLW1tZEhwMFFQb2I0OEpHU2U2OGhzZWtWckdKaDMxa1A0cU5vaXluU05lWGlCUXBhRTZqMVZMVDE1Tml4V3ZPcHdqWG80aDFBQlNPY1MxVlY0MEEzOXRVRHJJcVc3TW5Yc2ViNFAxS1lyczF4VGFDTEs5V0M4TXdnQ3VFeGE4VVNwSg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A new case study offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential future of transplantation medicine. A man with type 1 diabetes is now able to make his own insulin thanks to a transplant of gene-edited pancreatic cells—a transplant that hasn’t required the typical drugs used to avoid rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in Sweden and the U.S. conducted the research, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2503822"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this week in the New England Journal of Medicine. The 42-year-old man with long-standing diabetes was given donated islet cells that were genetically modified via CRISPR to prevent immune rejection. Roughly four months after the procedure, his fully gene-edited cells have continued to produce insulin without provoking an immune response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our study, although preliminary, suggests that immune evasion is an alternative concept for the circumvention of allorejection,” the authors wrote in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with type 1 diabetes have immune systems that destroy the pancreatic cells responsible for making insulin. The condition can be managed with regular doses of synthetic insulin, but people’s health still tends to worsen over time. Recently, scientists have been studying whether donated islet cell transplants can provide a self-sustained replacement supply of insulin for type 1 diabetics—an effective cure, in other words, provided the cells can survive long-term.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early clinical trials of the technology have &lt;a href="https://news.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-presents-positive-data-zimislecel-type-1-diabetes"&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; promising so far, but these transplants still require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy to ensure the host’s body doesn’t go after the donated cells. Effective as these drugs are, they have their well-known drawbacks, such as weakening people’s immunity to actual threats like infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study researchers have been experimenting with a unique approach to sidestep the need for these drugs. They first tested it on mice and monkeys, with this new case being the first test in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They created three specific edits in the donated cells, all intended to quiet the most likely responses from the immune system. Two of the edits deplete the cells’ supply of HLA class I and II antigens, proteins that tell our T cells whether another cell is foreign or not. A third edit causes the donated cells to make more of another protein called CD47 that inhibits the activity of other immune cells that would normally target them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers injected the modified cells into the man’s forearm. The edits weren’t completely successful in some of the cells, and the man’s immune system quickly killed off these cells. But as hoped, his body left the fully edited cells alone, even without immunosuppressants. The surviving cells produced insulin as normal, and the man appeared to be doing well 12 weeks later. He did experience several adverse events, but none were serious or linked to the transplanted cells themselves (he had mildly inflamed veins where a catheter was placed, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This study is only a proof of concept, geared more at showing the procedure can be done safely than at proving it actually works. The man was given a relatively low dose of the donated cells, likely too low for his body to produce enough insulin on its own to no longer need treatment. Follow-up is also needed to know whether these cells can survive long-term.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there’s much to be encouraged about. And it’s the latest sign that scientists are truly on the verge of making type 1 diabetes curable. Other research teams have shown early success in using similar transplants to cure the condition, including some that have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/in-medical-first-womans-type-1-diabetes-seemingly-cured-by-stem-cells-2000506407"&gt;also avoided needing&lt;/a&gt; immunosuppressant therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Florida has seen 16 cases this year, according to the state’s health department. &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/vibrio-vulnificus-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Seventeen cases have been reported in Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; — more than previous years’ annual averages. North Carolina has seen seven cases this year so far, the state Department of Health and Human Services confirmed to NBC News. And Mississippi has had three cases so far this year, the state’s health department says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4e1578" class="body-graf"&gt;Initial deaths from the infection in Florida were reported in counties spread around the state’s extensive coastline, from Bay County in the Panhandle and Hillsborough County, where Tampa is, on the Gulf Coast, to Broward County in Southeastern Florida and St. Johns County just south of Jacksonville. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d2b49" class="body-graf"&gt;The bacteria can get into the body through open wounds in the skin and cause the surrounding tissue to die, a condition known as necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; People can also get Vibrio vulnificus from eating contaminated foods, particularly raw oysters. It’s unclear how the people in Florida were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-63a2b5" class="body-graf"&gt;About 1 in 5 people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70793b" class="body-graf"&gt;Antarpreet Jutla, an engineering professor at the University of Florida, said that infections are still rare but “something is off this year.” Still, he said there are too many unknowns to be certain what's causing the rise in infections at this time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e2f9dc" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is certainly not normal, that’s one thing,” Jutla said. “We haven’t had that many cases early on in the summer for a very long time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-658b95" class="body-graf"&gt;Jutla said Vibrio vulnificus infections tend to increase after hurricanes. Last year, Florida saw a total of 82 cases, which may have been exacerbated by the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/hurricanes/hurricane-season-ends-rcna181808" target="_blank"&gt;“extremely active” hurricane season. &lt;/a&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hurricane-idalia-concerns-flesh-eating-bacteria-rcna102181" target="_blank"&gt;bacteria can linger&lt;/a&gt; in hurricane floodwaters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74b11d" class="body-graf"&gt;“Something happened this year that triggered the pathogens a little bit more than before,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44b37a" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/prediction-remains-on-track-for-above-normal-atlantic-hurricane-season" target="_blank"&gt;Hurricane season this year&lt;/a&gt; is still expected to be above normal as the U.S. enters its peak period, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5e444" class="body-graf"&gt;Jutla’s research group is investigating why there are high concentrations of plankton and chlorophyll — indicators for vibrio — across Florida’s panhandle. He calls it a “concern.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-509d8f" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Vibrio vulnificus? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c5f2e3" class="body-graf"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is one of over 200 species of Vibrio bacteria, said Rita Colwell, a professor emerita of microbiology at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84ef02" class="body-graf"&gt;The majority of Vibrio infections aren’t harmful to humans, Jutla said. Some only affect other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6854d5" class="body-graf"&gt;But Vibrio bacteria do cause about 80,000 infections in people each year, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24884-vibrio-vulnificus" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Most of those cases are gastrointestinal. Only a small handful — 100 to 200 cases — are due to Vibrio vulnificus. Other Vibrio species, including Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio alginolyticus, are often the cause of those stomach illnesses. Another type of Vibrio, Vibrio cholorae, causes the diarrheal disease cholera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3aeee6" class="body-graf"&gt;Because Vibrio bacteria prefer warm water, they are typically found along the southeastern shores of the U.S., but they are also found on the West Coast. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/fear-warming-oceans-flesh-eating-bacteria-rcna75935" target="_blank"&gt;As ocean temperatures warm&lt;/a&gt;, more cases have been found farther north in recent years, Jutla said, including some in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/3-people-die-flesh-eating-bacteria-infections-new-york-connecticut-pro-rcna100364" target="_blank"&gt;New York, Connecticut and Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b78964" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd93ce" class="body-graf"&gt;Vibrio bacteria can creep in open wounds after spending time in salty or brackish water, said Dr. Norman Beatty, an infectious disease doctor at University of Florida Health. Most cases he’s seen have been associated with spending extended time in the water, but he says that even a brief exposure could be the “only thing needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5a7a11" class="body-graf"&gt;Visible signs of an infection can start in just a few hours, Beatty said, and include redness, swelling and “bull’s-eye” blisters. The site will also be painful. If infection progresses, it can get into the bloodstream and cause sepsis, which can be deadly. Symptoms of sepsis include fever, chills and dangerously low blood pressure, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-18ecdc" class="body-graf"&gt;People with liver cirrhosis, weakened immune systems and those over 65 are most at risk for infection, Jutla said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d8a29d" class="body-graf"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus infections can be treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-5fd37e" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prevent Vibrio infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a21ff4" class="body-graf"&gt;Beatty said he recommends covering up any open wounds before going into the ocean. Even a waterproof Band-Aid does the job, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46f0fc" class="body-graf"&gt;If people think they have an infection, they should seek care immediately, Beatty said. Delaying can be the difference between developing severe complications and a more mild infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-55bfe4" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“A delay in presenting to health care is truly the likely reason why most people have a more serious outcome than others,” he said. “People who present within the same day with signs and symptoms of early infection, who receive antibiotics, can do well and can avoid a lot of these serious complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 13:10:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNOS1RWW9yLUhxMDJjZzU2TGZ4M25vNzRVWHktLXZWUmNRNWRqcWZhZDZEZnN6M1VBSlB6bENzeFpxTW5VZXFpM2NqNFZfQ1Q3ZHlnMnBHUDYtU1A1R0tEbFBJTC1jRlhJMjRCMndoOFl5WndTR0tValg0U2FNVVNydF9WMklmckRReEh1d3Zrb1pnNjdNTHkyVUVpc3lhb2h2SUgyTTJCZlRtR0XSAVZBVV95cUxPemRIXzRpNUpxRnBZTW1KRnN2a0JaY2lxeUZWYTgxT1pOMDdiWjUydVJZNVFmZnVoVkRMMXdpdkhFTmlrOVZXQWNKQk55YkY5MENndkt0QQ</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法， 6种预防脑雾的食物- EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE1ack9YZFQwbmsxOW1zTVJVdHRwd3FCaGI4eGpiRm5zVUoyMzVLd1JfaG5JVFJ3Wk5NSjdjRDFWbE1lbjI4YmxRWDA2WFQtOTYzcENlR0JNYWJKcHRsSEI2Rm9GUFJHZUFaWXktMi1sUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve ever walked into a room and forgotten why you entered, or spent hours searching for that one thing that you just&lt;em&gt; know &lt;/em&gt;is somewhere (but where?!), you may be suffering from brain fog. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Brain fog isn’t a formal medical diagnosis per se,” says &lt;a href="https://www.wendybazilian.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Wendy Bazilian, Dr.P.H., M.A., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “But many people use it to describe that frustrating feeling of mental fuzziness—when your thinking feels slower, your memory feels off [with] little mental blips or delays.” If you can relate, you’re not alone. One recent study of more than 25,000 adults found that 28% of them &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-of-cognitive-decline-11767736" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reported experiencing brain fog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Luckily, what you eat plays a role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-eat-every-week-for-better-brain-health-11784254" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;keeping your brain sharp&lt;/a&gt; and your memory in tip-top shape. To find out the foods you should be eating for better mental clarity, we dug into the research and talked to registered dietitians. Here’s what you need to know.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-dark-leafy-greens"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Dark Leafy Greens  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Time and time again, studies looking at the best foods to preserve cognition reinforce that we should be eating dark green leafy vegetables every day, if possible,” says &lt;a href="https://maggiemoon.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Maggie Moon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bazilian echoes the importance of eating your greens (which is why they’re at the top of our list!). Consider the results of this study, she says: “Older adults who ate just one serving of leafy greens a day experienced slower decline in memory and thinking skills compared to those who rarely ate them. In fact, the difference was so striking that their brains functioned as if they were 11 years younger.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Researchers hypothesize that the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants in leafy greens&lt;/a&gt;, including lutein, alpha-tocopherol and kaempferol, help keep brains sharp as we age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But those antioxidants aren’t the only reason greens help keep your brain clear and sharp. “[Greens] provide folate, vitamin E, carotenoids and flavonoids, which improve the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the brain, and help address neuroinflammation that can diminish cognitive performance,” notes Moon. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are so many different ways to eat your greens, even if you think you’re not a fan. Toss them into a green smoothie, scrambled eggs, pasta or a salad. And don’t be afraid to experiment to find the ones that work for you.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re feeling forgetful or fuzzy, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fruit-to-lower-dementia-risk-11777712" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;berries can help&lt;/a&gt;. Bazilian likens eating them to upgrading a processor on an old computer, where “tasks that were slow or glitchy before become smooth and responsive.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Berries are packed with brain-supporting nutrients, like fiber, vitamins, minerals and polyphenols. They are also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-antioxidant-rich-foods-you-should-eat-11776388" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rich in antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; called anthocyanins that are linked to better brain health, particularly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-to-improve-your-memory-8415078" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;improved memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your main brain fog symptom is feeling mentally sluggish, wild blueberries might help rev things up. In a randomized control trial of people over 65 years old with mild cognitive issues, those who consumed wild blueberry powder daily for six months experienced improvements in mental processing speed compared to those who took a placebo.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While wild blueberries have higher concentrations of anthocyanins than regular blueberries, all berries are believed to do good things for brain health. And they don’t have to be fresh to do their thing. When fresh berries are out of season, look for frozen berries and whir them into smoothies or stir them into yogurt. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-mushrooms"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Mushrooms  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may not think of mushrooms first when it comes to healthy foods to add to your diet, but these fungi are powerful. “Mushrooms are often a forgotten food in the U.S., but they deserve our attention for their potential brain-health benefits,” notes Moon. “Their bioactives may lower inflammation and oxidative stress common to mental fatigue.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, research has linked mushroom consumption with cognitive performance, including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-mistakes-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-11779797" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better memory and executive function&lt;/a&gt; among middle-aged and older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition, a culturally adapted version of the MIND diet that includes several weekly servings of mushrooms has been associated with better cognitive function in observational studies, adds Moon.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, different mushrooms have different nutrients and bioactive compounds. So, aim to eat a variety of your favorite mushrooms a few times a week. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There are dozens of individual studies on cognition and walnut consumption, and the science suggests a positive relationship between nut intake and cognitive performance,” says Bazilian. This is likely due to walnuts’ plant omega-3s in the form of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) plus antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t just eat walnuts to sharpen your brain today. Longer-term, walnuts may also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7909431/have-a-family-history-of-dementia-or-alzheimers-heres-how-to-protect-your-brain-as-you-age/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;decrease the risk of developing brain disorders&lt;/a&gt; like Parkinson’s disease, depression and stroke. Research finds that eating 1 to 2 ounces per day may help improve cognitive function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, they’re a tasty, convenient snack. But walnuts are also a fantastic way to add a healthy crunch to yogurt, oatmeal, energy bites, salads, pasta and more.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s not surprising to see &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-fish-regularly-8677271" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fatty fish like salmon and sardines&lt;/a&gt; on a list of the best foods to prevent brain fog. Fatty fish deliver &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-for-brain-health-as-you-age-11739345" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;DHA and EPA&lt;/a&gt;, long-chain omega-3 fats that may improve learning, memory and overall well-being by increasing blood flow to the brain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Neurons need omega-3s like we need good cell service—it makes a big difference in how well they can connect and work together,” explains Moon. “Omega-3s also have anti-inflammatory properties the brain needs to recover from daily wear and tear or other stressors that may contribute to brain fog.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moon’s pick? Sardines. “Sardines are low on the food chain for sustainability, but high in omega-3s for brain health.” Other &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-types-of-fish-for-brain-health-8609071" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3-rich fish&lt;/a&gt; include salmon, mackerel, herring and anchovies.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-water"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Water &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While technically not a food (we know, we know), water is so important for your brain. “Mild dehydration is directly linked to having a hard time focusing, thinking, learning and remembering,” says Moon. The result, she says, is that hungover, foggy feeling that makes it difficult to think straight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The impact of dehydration is so profound that one study of older adults found that poor hydration increased their risk of cognitive decline. Conversely, additional research has linked hydration to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-in-the-morning-for-better-cognitive-function-11689092" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better cognitive performance on tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If drinking enough water feels like a challenge, Moon says all forms of fluid work. Whether it’s coffee, green tea, 100% orange juice, cucumbers, watermelon, grapes or tomatoes, there are lots of foods and drinks that can help you get the fluids you need to stay on the ball.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have brain fog, you’ll be happy to know that there are foods that may help you think more clearly. Research has shown that leafy greens, berries, mushrooms, walnuts and fatty fish can all help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;keep your brain in top shape&lt;/a&gt;. While these foods aren’t magic, including them in a healthy eating plan may help keep your brain sharper, faster and less foggy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A healthy diet is like your brain’s personal assistant, giving it all the nutrients it needs to perform its best,” says Moon. “What we eat can be just as important as what we limit, so that we aren’t overburdening the brain with additional metabolic stress that can exacerbate brain fog.” In addition to loading up on these brain-supporting foods, try to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911108/best-and-worst-foods-for-brain-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;limit foods and ingredients linked to poorer brain health&lt;/a&gt;, like added sugars, refined grains, alcohol and saturated fats. And don’t underestimate the power of hydration, as dehydration can mess with learning and memory. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  While you’re at it, why not keep your brain in top shape in other ways? Getting enough sleep, moving your body and limiting stress (to the best of your ability!) can also keep your brain on top of its game. Then, get ready to say bye-bye brain fog and hello mental clarity.

She was in a graduate program, was working full-time, and had just been the maid of honor at her childhood best friend’s wedding. She was also only 28 years old. “It felt like absolutely everything about me was stripped away at that moment,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She moved home to begin treatment: six months of chemo, a lumpectomy, and radiation. She was declared cancer-free in April 2020, but four years later, doctors discovered she’d developed metastatic thyroid cancer—all before her 33rd birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that story sounds eerily similar to ones you’ve heard from friends, it’s not a coincidence. Since 1990, the global incidence of early-onset cancer (cancers diagnosed in people younger than 50) has increased by nearly 80 percent and is projected to rise by another 31 percent by 2030, according to a study in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BMJ Oncology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;BMJ Oncology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. And compared to men under 50, women of the same age have an 82 percent higher rate, up from 51 percent in 2002, according to the American Cancer Society’s most recent &lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/2025CancerFactsandFigures" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:annual report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;annual report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of all that, young people’s cancers tend to be more aggressive, often because they’re diagnosed at later stages. Colon and rectal cancers lead the uptick with the fastest rate increases, followed by uterine, blood (leukemia), kidney, and breast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, one of the biggest risk factors for cancer has been age. Now, being young isn’t the protector it once was, and scientists are disturbed, to say the least. Even if you don’t have someone in your life affected by cancer, you’ve probably noticed the increase in the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former &lt;em&gt;Bachelorette&lt;/em&gt; star &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a35447561/katie-thurston-bachelor-matt-james/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Katie Thurston;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Katie Thurston&lt;/a&gt; was just 34 when she found a cancerous lump in her breast; &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a40324405/jessie-j-body-shamers-pregnant-statement/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessie J;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jessie J&lt;/a&gt; recently shared that she was diagnosed with breast cancer at 37; &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a46660911/teddi-mellencamp-melanoma/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Teddi Mellencamp;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Teddi Mellencamp&lt;/a&gt; was 41 when doctors discovered melanoma; &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63422232/kate-middleton-cancer-remission/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kate Middleton;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kate Middleton&lt;/a&gt; was 42 when she talked about her cancer diagnosis; &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a60775792/olivia-munn-hysterectomy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Olivia Munn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Olivia Munn&lt;/a&gt; was 43 when she underwent a double mastectomy and hysterectomy for stage I aggressive breast cancer.

(Screening ages for some cancers have begun to inch down, but general recommendations haven’t dipped below 40.) For example, people at average risk are advised to start &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a32998464/chrissy-teigen-pap-smear-mammograms-instagram/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mammograms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mammograms&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection/american-cancer-society-recommendations-for-the-early-detection-of-breast-cancer.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:between the ages of 40 and 45;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;between the ages of 40 and 45&lt;/a&gt; and colorectal cancer screenings &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:at age 45;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;at age 45&lt;/a&gt;, according to the American Cancer Society. These ages are recommended partly because of the burden that earlier screenings would put on the medical system and because screening technology that works for older people might not be as effective on younger folks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mammograms, for one, aren’t as reliable in younger women, who tend to have &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62138347/dense-breasts-mammogram-fda/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:denser breast tissue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;denser breast tissue&lt;/a&gt;, says Ann Partridge, MD, MPH, interim chair of the department of medical oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and cofounder and director of the Program for Young Adults with Breast Cancer. “You’d be looking for needles in haystacks, unfortunately,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s still a lot more that researchers need to learn about which individuals are most at risk so they can start screening those candidates earlier. In the meantime, it might feel tempting to turn to pricey private companies that offer cancer-screening blood tests (like Galleri) or whole-body MRI scans (like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a45530775/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-review/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prenuvo;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Prenuvo&lt;/a&gt;), but those are not quite ready for clinical application yet, says Veda Giri, MD, a medical oncologist and director of the Early Onset Cancer Program at Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while we wait for better research, tumors in adults under 50 are only getting bigger—and their symptoms more severe. “If a colon cancer is diagnosed at 42, it wasn’t due to screening; it was due to symptoms,” says Therese Bartholomew Bevers, MD, medical director of the Cancer Prevention Center at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Jenna Putala, 27, a diagnosis took years to receive. Throughout her college softball career she was riddled with unexplained injuries and other health problems that sent her to an orthopedic surgeon and a neurologist. “No one did any scans,” she remembers. “Doctors just told me, ‘Move on, keep stretching, you’re fine.’” It wasn’t until last year, when a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62754772/chiropractor-cervical-neck-adjustment-stroke-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chiropractor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chiropractor&lt;/a&gt; sent her for an MRI of her back (where the pain originally was), that a scan showed the tip of an eight-centimeter tumor lower down, on her pelvis. Doctors think she’s been living with this PEComa, a rare form of sarcoma, since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the tumor’s size, its placement, and her age, doctors don’t want to remove it; it would alter her quality of life too dramatically. She could lose part of her bowel or sciatic nerve or her pelvis could cave in on itself. Instead, Putala attempted to harvest her eggs to preserve her fertility (but couldn’t because it turned out her tumor was estrogen-sensitive), underwent 40 rounds of radiation, and is on chemo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the rest of her life, to keep her cancer as manageable as possible, she’ll get regular screenings, go to physical therapy, and try different chemo treatments until they stop working or make her too sick to continue. Today, Putala is back at work and fighting for a sense of normalcy after a “whirlwind” year, but that doesn’t make her prolonged diagnosis any easier to swallow. “I honestly don’t even think it crossed doctors’ minds that I could have cancer,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is really a moment for everyone to rethink who a cancer patient is. Young women with no family history or obvious risk factor like smoking—women who are doing everything right—are still being diagnosed, so doctors and patients alike shouldn’t rule out the possibility. “I was a college athlete, I went to the gym all the time, I ate healthy,” Putala says. “I was doing all of these things that could help prevent cancer, so why did I get it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Blake Cale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hunt For The Cause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are racing to figure out why cancer rates are rising, but the unsatisfying truth is that there’s not much experts know for sure yet. While it’s unlikely one single cause will be found, there are some prime suspects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, our diets have changed across generations. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63975057/ultra-processed-foods-biological-aging-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; (UPFs) make up more than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316624011258#sec4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:half of the American diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;half of the American diet&lt;/a&gt; and take up &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43016-024-01095-7.epdf%3Fsharing_token%3DHrsoCCDnlHqlMnAxzCeiX9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Pn_te04WoNJigI2pJcdH0K3EukeZ9Gq--mkQ7oSARf7-kWs5eA_jt_tMPMWBBooQGTsUcBFmQzoedq-5e4pFjLmFjcqJRYG3Uwt7ZWYhOqmg-Bf04qLNLh_hnpxFKF5-g%253D&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65614815%2Fcancer-rates-young-people-prevention%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:70 percent of our grocery store space;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;70 percent of our grocery store space&lt;/a&gt;. Foods such as processed meats, sugary drinks (including artificially sweetened ones), and spreads and condiments have been &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(23)00190-4/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked to cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked to cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to past generations, people today are consuming UPFs at younger and younger ages, potentially meaning that the damage is starting earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These dietary habit changes can affect our &lt;a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-024-00177-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gut microbiom;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gut microbiom&lt;/a&gt;e, inflammation, and insulin levels—all of which can play a role in developing cancer, says Jeffrey Meyerhardt, MD, MPH, codirector of the Colon and Rectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger generations may differ in body composition as well. From 1990 to 2020, adult obesity has doubled while childhood obesity has quadrupled, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight#:~:text=Worldwide%20adult%20obesity%20has%20more,16%25%20were%20living%20with%20obesity." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has linked obesity with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6754861/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:13 different kinds of cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;13 different kinds of cancer&lt;/a&gt;, including colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian. “We think it’s because having extra body weight can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64040296/chronic-inflammation-anti-inflammatory-habits-doctors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chronic inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;,” says Dr. Bevers. Extra weight might also impact sex hormones, which play a role in some cancers, and insulin levels, which can be a growth factor for cancer, says Dr. Meyerhardt. (On the other hand, muscle is actually associated with improved insulin sensitivity, he says.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No surprise that physical activity also probably has a hand in this. Moving—and exercise—are thought to decrease cancer risk because of their effect on the factors we’ve been talking about: inflammation, insulin, body composition, and hormones, says Dr. Meyerhardt. While it doesn’t explain the rising cancer rates in younger people specifically, globally, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-06-2024-nearly-1.8-billion-adults-at-risk-of-disease-from-not-doing-enough-physical-activity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one-third of adults;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one-third of adults&lt;/a&gt; didn’t meet the recommended physical activity levels in 2022. That’s up by about five percentage points from 2010, and this number is expected only to increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These potential risk factors leave us with as many questions as answers, especially among people who have none of them. “Diet, activity, obesity—that’s not going to explain everything,” says Dr. Meyerhardt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, What Can You Do Now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind: Cancer at younger ages is still not super common. (We’re talking roughly 103 out of every 100,000 individuals, according to a study in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2808381" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Network Open;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.) Rather than freaking out (because who wouldn’t?), it’s best to focus on being proactive, says Dr. Giri. There are things you can do—and they’re all pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Keep up with the basics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not the most exciting thing you’ve ever heard, but the core tenets of Healthy Living 101 apply here. Eat well (focus as much as possible on whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and limit highly processed foods, sugar, and red meat); hit 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity each week; get the recommended vaccines, especially for HPV; and avoid smoking and drinking as much as you can. Alcohol and tobacco are Group 1 carcinogens, per &lt;a href="https://monographs.iarc.who.int/list-of-classifications/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the IARC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the IARC&lt;/a&gt;, which means there’s sufficient evidence to classify them as carcinogenic to humans. UV light is also a Group 1 carcinogen—so protect yourself from the sun too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Flag your symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any new lump, unexplained weight loss, change in bowel habits (like blood in your stool or black tar-like stools), abdominal pain, or cough is a symptom to take seriously, says Dr. Bevers. The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms-of-cancer.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; also lists fatigue or extreme tiredness, eating problems, skin changes, unusual bleeding or bruising, and bladder changes as potential signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might sound like a broad list, but the bottom line is this: “Whether it’s a new lump, a new pain, a new discomfort—something that’s just different and not going away—be sure to bring it to your doctor,” says Dr. Giri. Feeling like something is off can give rise to a range of emotions, she adds, including fear, guilt, and shame, but it’s important to not let that stop you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a rule Harris has lived by ever since her diagnosis. After she offhandedly mentioned to her doctor that her throat swelled and felt itchy one evening while at a friend’s house, her doctor sent her for an ultrasound, which is how they discovered her thyroid cancer. Now, “any small concern—even if I think it might sound stupid, even if it’s embarrassing, I really don’t care—I bring it up to my doctors,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you mention it to your physician and they blow it off or their recommendation doesn’t help? “Don’t feel discouraged. Bring it back to them,” says Dr. Giri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Get a clear picture of your risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk assessment is a key to avoiding a too-late diagnosis and to giving yourself more options, and it’s something anyone and everyone should be doing, per experts. When Alison Hall, 33, calculated her breast cancer risk assessment score—using the same free online tool that &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a60189322/olivia-munn-luminal-b-breast-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Olivia Munn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Olivia Munn&lt;/a&gt; used (the &lt;a href="https://magview.com/ibis-risk-calculator/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Assessment Calculator;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Assessment Calculator&lt;/a&gt;)—she discovered that she had a 36 percent risk, which is a low score on a math test but high when it comes to cancer risk. A doctor told her to start getting biannual screenings. Her first mammogram was clear, but an MRI just six months later found cancer in its earliest stage of malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall opted for a double mastectomy. “I don’t want to spend the rest of my life looking down at my breasts and wondering what is going on in there,” she says. Plus, the alternative, a lumpectomy and 5 to 10 years of hormone therapy, would delay her family planning by several years (and might have raised the risk of a recurrence during or after pregnancy, as a result of fluctuating hormones).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large part of calculating your risk involves understanding your family history of cancer—which isn’t always easy to do. You can plug this info into an online risk calculator, like the one Munn and Hall used, Dana-Farber’s &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/community-health/assess-your-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Assess Your Risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Assess Your Risk&lt;/a&gt; tool, the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/family-health-history/communication-resources/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:My Family Health Portrait: Cancer Edition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;My Family Health Portrait: Cancer Edition&lt;/a&gt; (an app), or the ACS’s &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/cancer-risk-360.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CancerRisk360;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CancerRisk360&lt;/a&gt;. But ideally, once you’ve gathered your data, you can bring it to your doctor and ask about next steps. “I certainly didn’t have this on my bingo card, but the earlier that things are caught, the better,” Hall says. Instead of being scared by the prospect of finding things out, she says, “see it as something you can be empowered by.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Hearst Owned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How To Find Out Your Family History&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with a family history of certain cancers—including breast, ovarian, uterine, and colorectal—screening and testing might be recommended at younger ages, even up to 10 years earlier than when your relative was first diagnosed. But that means finding out your family’s health history. There are plenty of reasons someone might not be able to access much info about their blood relatives’ medical histories, and that’s okay, says Dr. Giri. Doctors are able to work with the info you do have and can help sleuth out as much as possible. But here’s what to aim to get details on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you can speak to relatives about their health history, find out this info:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask if they ever had cancer, what kind it was (keep in mind that sometimes people have multiple types, which is helpful to know), and the age they were diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inquire about your grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins (living and deceased). Sometimes doctors can identify generational patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease into the conversation with these strategies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about the best people to turn to, both in terms of who you suspect will be most receptive and who will have the most information. Some families have one person who knows a lot about the entire clan, Dr. Giri says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be strategic about when to talk—when everyone is around for the holidays, or in private with certain people? Hard conversations like those about health and cancer might need to unfold over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be prepared to explain why you’re asking. Sometimes leaving family members with a resource to read on their own (like this story or one of the American Cancer Society’s flyers) can help get the ball rolling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If no one will talk or you don’t have anyone to ask… &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider genetic testing.

They found that CRC screening, which was at 20% in 2021, jumped to 37% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 45- to 49-year-olds, colonoscopy screening increased by 43%, and stool-based testing increased more than five times from 2019 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Jessica Star, associate scientist at ACS in Atlanta, considers it "thrilling" to see this increase in screening among younger individuals, as it's likely linked to earlier-stage diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, we still have a long way to go," she said in the release. "Screening for colorectal cancer in ages 45 to 49 remains suboptimal, and has not increased equitably by both educational attainment and insurance status."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The study findings support efforts for everyone in the 45 to 49 age group to have access to screening.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul E. Oberstein, M.D., medical oncologist and assistant director of the Pancreatic Cancer Center at NYU Langone Perlmutter Cancer Center, said the increase in screening is "successful in detecting more cancers at an early stage where the chance of cure is very high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This ultimately should mean that fewer people are diagnosed later in life and fewer people have advanced colon cancer," Oberstein, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study reinforces the need to focus research on understanding the causes of colon cancer increases – and possible steps to reduce these cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Individuals of all ages should contact a doctor if colorectal cancer symptoms arise, an oncologist said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of colon cancer in those under 45 remains "substantially lower," he noted, "so it is not clear yet if universal screening at a younger age is beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some specific patients who are younger than 45 may benefit from earlier screening, however, such as those with a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/genetics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:family history;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;family history&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cache Creek Casino Resort, a 659-room luxury hotel featuring legal gambling in the unincorporated community of Brooks, issued the statement in collaboration with the Yolo County Health and Human Services Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the statement, officials said casino staff “are conducting contact tracing to identify and notify individuals who may have had close contact with the affected person. Health authorities define close contact as having a cumulative exposure of at least eight hours to the individual with (tuberculosis).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; said the tuberculosis bacteria can be spread through coughing, sneezing or speaking with others nearby. Coughs that last three weeks or longer, chest pain, and coughing up blood all are symptoms of the infection, the agency said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, appetite loss, chills, fever and night sweats. The CDCP also said many people who catch the bacteria for tuberculosis never show symptoms and have an “inactive infection” that is not contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The casino urged employees and those who have stayed at the resort in the past three months to contact their health care provider. They said that urgency is even higher for people with a compromised immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials did not say how they came to find out about the exposure or when it happened. A message left for the casino on Thursday was not returned immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health on &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/TBCB.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt; said 2,100 people caught tuberculosis in California last year, 10 fewer than in 2023. Twenty-six of those cases were children under 5 years old.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the state’s annual incidence rate of 5.4 cases per 100,000 persons is nearly double the national rate, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest difference between whole milk and 2% is fat content—nutrient levels like calcium and vitamin D are nearly identical.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole milk’s fat can boost satiety, help absorb key vitamins, and may even support heart health when consumed in moderation, while 2% is better for those looking for low-fat dairy options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The healthiest milk is the one you’ll enjoy and drink regularly—both whole and 2% offer the same core benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/milk-storage-mistake" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Milk is a staple&lt;/a&gt; in almost every household, whether it’s poured over cereal, added to coffee, blended into smoothies, or enjoyed in a glass. But when it comes to choosing between whole milk and 2%, the decision can feel more complicated than it seems. Is one option healthier? Does fat content really make a difference? What should you consider when picking what’s right for you or your family? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We spoke with some experts to break down the real differences between the types of milk you might see on grocery store shelves, and how to make the best choice for you and your dietary needs.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-whats-the-main-difference-between-whole-milk-vs-2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What’s the Main Difference Between Whole Milk vs. 2%? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The difference is the fat content,” says &lt;a href="https://www.michelleschack.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Michelle Schack&lt;/a&gt;, dairy veterinarian and co-founder of DairyKind, a company that works to promote animal care and nutritional transparency. “Whole milk has 3.25% fat content (by weight) while 2% milk has, as the name suggests, 2% fat content (by weight),” she says. Whole milk has about eight grams of fat and roughly 150 calories per cup, while 2% milk contains around five grams of fat and 120 calories. But otherwise, Dr. Schack goes on to share that the other key nutrient levels—like calcium and vitamin D—are nearly identical. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Similarly, registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://app.qwoted.com/sources/hilary-walentuck" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Hilary Walentuk, RD&lt;/a&gt;, agrees. “All cow’s milk, regardless of fat content, contains the same 13 essential nutrients per serving,” she explains, including essential vitamins, potassium, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-that-have-the-most-protein-8763731" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt;, which are all vital for maintaining &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-bone-health-7495764" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;bone density&lt;/a&gt;, muscle function, and overall health. “The only real nutritional difference is the fat and calorie content. Everything else stays the same.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-role-of-fat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Role of Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fat has long been treated as something to avoid—but in reality, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;not all fats are created equal&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to milk, fats serve many important functions in the body: “Fat carries flavor, so whole milk tends to taste richer, which can increase enjoyment,” Dr. Schack says. And that flavor could have an additional benefit, as people may find they’re more satisfied even when they're drinking less. “Whole milk tends to keep people feeling fuller longer because fat slows gastric emptying,” she explains.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fat also plays a role in how your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-nutrient-pairings-8778049" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;body absorbs nutrients&lt;/a&gt;. Vitamins A and D, which are both in milk, are fat-soluble, which means your body needs some fat to absorb them properly into the bloodstream. “Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption and bone health,” Dr. Schack says. “And vitamin D is one of the most common nutrient deficiencies in the U.S.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And it’s not just the healthy fats that give whole milk its edge. Walentuk shares that there are even more hidden benefits: “Whole milk dairy contains over 400 unique fatty acids,” she says. “This complex nutritional profile may help explain why studies show a link between full-fat dairy and heart health.” That doesn’t mean more is always better, but it definitely challenges the idea that low-fat equals healthier.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So how do you know which milk is best for you? The answer largely depends on your individual health goals, taste preferences, and lifestyle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re watching your fat intake for medical reasons—such as high cholesterol or heart disease—2% or low-fat options might be the healthier choice. “Lower-fat milk is a great option for someone looking to reduce calories or fat in their diet but not looking to sacrifice nutrition,” Walentuk says. “But the healthiest milk choice is the one a person will drink and enjoy.” And if you're concerned about heart health, research shows that moderate consumption of whole milk can still fit into &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/simple-healthy-habits-11690833" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy eating habits&lt;/a&gt;, especially when balanced with other dietary choices throughout the day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those who enjoy the taste of milk and want a creamier texture and richer flavor, whole milk might be a better fit, Dr. Schack says. However, “all milk is safe and wholesome,” she emphasizes. No matter your choice, both experts agree: you really can’t go wrong when drinking milk. “Milk is still one of the most accessible, affordable ways to get essential nutrients,” Walentuk says. “Whether it’s whole or 2%, the most important thing is that it works for you.”

Smiling can even increase creativity and cognitive capacity, because “there is an increase in endorphins, neuropeptides, dopamine, and serotonin,” says Ramón. “These hormones act together to &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/5-simple-tricks-to-instantly-lower-your-stress-levels" target="_blank"&gt;decrease stress&lt;/a&gt;, lower heart rate, increase productivity and reduce anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smiling for longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to longevity experts, social relationships are a kind of life insurance—and so is laughter.

The finding confirms ancient beliefs: “The Chinese Taoists believed in the power of smiling to heal the soul and bring longevity,” notes &lt;a data-offer-url="https://eugeniacervantes.com/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw5PK_BhBBEiwAL7GTPc2AurDy9nLZENriigeEhGjrOjsee73UH99glvNy1hRiz087mbw3xxoCXcwQAvD_BwE" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://eugeniacervantes.com/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw5PK_BhBBEiwAL7GTPc2AurDy9nLZENriigeEhGjrOjsee73UH99glvNy1hRiz087mbw3xxoCXcwQAvD_BwE"}' href="https://eugeniacervantes.com/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw5PK_BhBBEiwAL7GTPc2AurDy9nLZENriigeEhGjrOjsee73UH99glvNy1hRiz087mbw3xxoCXcwQAvD_BwE" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Eugenia Cervantes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smiling is also contagious, thanks to &lt;a data-offer-url="https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/347826472/1-s2.0-S107158192300191X-main.pdf" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/347826472/1-s2.0-S107158192300191X-main.pdf"}' href="https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/347826472/1-s2.0-S107158192300191X-main.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mirror neurons&lt;/a&gt; that evolved to increase empathy and improve social connection. “When you smile, it generates a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/the-secret-social-power-of-smiling" target="_blank"&gt;domino effect&lt;/a&gt; among others, creating a spontaneous good vibe,” says psychologist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.avancepsicologos.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.avancepsicologos.com/"}' href="https://www.avancepsicologos.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Laura Palomares&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What if I don’t feel like smiling?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are days when you simply don’t feel like smiling—and it’s important not to bury your authentic emotions. “We need to let ourselves feel all types of emotions,” explains Ramón. “But it is helpful to know that we can develop resources and strategies that help us in our daily lives and that we can be co-creators of our own reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging in activities that help us manage stress—such as mindfulness, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/demystifying-transcendental-meditation" target="_blank"&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt;, or deep breathing exercises—can help calm the nervous system. “This allows the brain to reallocate resources and helps restore a more balanced neurochemical environment, which can support dopamine production,” says Markopoulos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, engaging in positive activities that directly trigger the brain’s reward system can also lead to a release of dopamine. “When we do something we enjoy, whether it’s listening to music, spending time with loved ones, exercising, or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/healthy-habit-tips" target="_blank"&gt;achieving a small goal,&lt;/a&gt; the brain rewards us with a burst of dopamine,” says Markopoulos. “This feel-good signal reinforces the behavior, making us more likely to repeat it.” Below, Markopoulos shares more tips for triggering dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips for triggering dopamine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set and achieve small goals:&lt;/strong&gt; Accomplishing a task, no matter how minor, provides a sense of accomplishment and a corresponding dopamine release. Try making a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/bullet-journaling" target="_blank"&gt;to-do list&lt;/a&gt; and crossing items off throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1pODlNN1BGcDh3X1ZNZDRuN3J1YTJMeHlQN0k1allpMlZfeVFabU5DRS0wVkdPS0VlVHRsV3F6UTNrMUdwemhpNFY1TGNNZWZiTktYTUcyU3Q0dw</guid></item><item><title>专家表示，削减用于mRNA疫苗的联邦资金使美国变得脆弱- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE5tWTZJM2tQMk0wREtJajFJVTRuOXk4bXhVcTF1aUwwWHQzdGdST3R0Y2VDcDEzOENwX2NrOF9mdE9HeXQ5YXl0TWIxckVjeWF1ekRTVGFlYm13Ym9LNGxkUnBFM2RpTU8zYjhiQWNqNm1fVExjaENPMV9CN1BfZ9IBgwFBVV95cUxNQlZLN2RDSmg0RVJKTS1SdHo2SlAzUzRwT2JiN01ETmxoa2NreVdhWkp6U0I1dklVeEM5ZGZ6cHNqcDZuX3JqeWlUODhxTmFIM0ZObTJpZkV6YnlkNTdHOHFoOHh2X0d6d3d2RE5xNnpfQ21FM0lacDhVZGRjNUVYREtBZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            This week, President Donald Trump called &lt;a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-operation-warp-speed-vaccine-summit/" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Warp Speed&lt;/a&gt;, a public-private federal program that helped speed up the development and distribution of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines in record time “one of the most incredible things ever done in this country.” It was just a day after US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the federal government was canceling a half-billion dollars in investments into the same technology, saying no new mRNA projects will be initiated under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme20x0nl00053b6n1nt6jnl2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine and preparedness experts said the decision could be disastrous for the United States, rendering another Operation Warp Speed impossible in case of threat from disease or bioweapons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme22hx2300093b6nvpvrh143@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, who has a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/21/politics/fact-check-rfk-not-anti-vax/index.html"&gt;long history&lt;/a&gt; of spreading vaccine misinformation, incorrectly suggested in his announcement that mRNA vaccine technology is ineffective, unsafe and unethical — comments that experts worry will put a chill on development even beyond the projects the government cut.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme24vxur00003b6nlvsy8zkz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the cancellation, Kennedy said the decision was based on a review of science and expert opinions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme23t7mt0004336nf01efs8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Let me be absolutely clear: HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them,” Kennedy said in this week’s announcement. “That’s why we’re moving beyond the limitations of mRNA and investing in better solutions.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm20008336n016zn7s4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said funding will be shifted “toward safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate,” such as whole virus vaccines, which use a weakened or deactivated version of a virus to trigger immunity. China developed a whole virus Covid-19 vaccine, but studies showed it wasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00410-2/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;nearly as effective&lt;/a&gt; as the mRNA vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm20009336n5pgtycy9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I wonder why we want to try and go back to the way it was in the 1940s when we had vaccines, but it took a really long time to make them,” Dr. Cynthia Leifer, a &lt;a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/research/cynthia-leifer-phd" target="_blank"&gt;professor of immunology&lt;/a&gt; at Cornell University said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000a336n6u8l1lo8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She equates the abandonment of mRNA research at this point to partially paying for a kitchen remodel and stopping to save money after the walls have been demolished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000b336nebpfxlc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You’d be out your money and you don’t have a kitchen,” Leifer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000c336nzjp3vsxv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The mRNA vaccine platform is uniquely suited to protect a country during a pandemic, said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and director of the &lt;a href="https://pandemics.sph.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Pandemic Center&lt;/a&gt; at the Brown University School of Public Health. Not knowing what will cause the next pandemic, she said, “mRNA vaccines offer real flexibility that other vaccine approaches don’t.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000d336n7cxxth2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For a flu vaccine, for example, makers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7047267/#:~:text=To%20egg%20or%20not%20to,sometimes%20it's%20a%20lot%20different." target="_blank"&gt;use eggs&lt;/a&gt; to grow the virus. It’s a complicated process that may require several months to make enough, Nuzzo said. But mRNA vaccines can be developed much faster, sometimes even in days, and don’t require time to grow virus cultures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000e336n1cxv0tuj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When making an mRNA vaccine, scientists take messenger RNA, a single strand of the genetic code, that can teach cells how “read” and make a protein that triggers an immune response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000g336nkc3cisul@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota epidemiologist,  said the decision to “wind down” the government’s investment in mRNA vaccines is one of the worst public health decisions in decades, particularly for pandemic preparedness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000h336n4r7m3wuw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Osterholm, who is the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/michael-t-osterholdm-phd-mph" target="_blank"&gt;founding director&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy&lt;/a&gt; and author of the forthcoming book&lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/michael-t-osterholm-phd-mph/the-big-one/9780316258340/" target="_blank"&gt; “The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics,”&lt;/a&gt; said vaccines are a “very, very small part of the pharmaceutical industry’s portfolio” since there’s not a lot of profit in vaccines. It’s government money that drives companies to make them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1zg98f0016336n8v283a64@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some mRNA projects are funded through other parts of the government, but Kennedy’s announcement may undermine mRNA vaccines in general.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000j336nzhov2hcv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The constant undercutting of support for vaccines is really a challenge. So the damage was twofold,” Osterholm said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000k336nfj3162it@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If we had another pandemic today, we would have to watch large parts of the world not get vaccinated for several years and based on what’s just happened, the United States would probably be at the end of the line, not the head of the line like it was in Covid.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000l336ni0ope4w6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nuzzo said it’s possible another pandemic may not happen during Trump’s term, but the decision leaves the US vulnerable in another way: Retreat from investment in mRNA vaccines may even be seen as an opening for an attack.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1zmptt001a336nl4tpxaoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Defense posturing and defense preparation are the best form of deterrence for a biological attack,” she said.“It sends a bad signal to our adversaries about our commitments to protecting ourselves and our vulnerabilities to attack, let alone it stifles medical innovation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme26r5ss000g3b6n98u2yklb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Leaders in the Trump administration have pushed to bring drug manufacturing to the United States but experts say the choice to stop investing in mRNA vaccines will do the opposite.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000n336nfcaxqxga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/16/us/katalin-kariko-covid-19-vaccine-scientist-trnd"&gt;Dr. Katalin Karikó&lt;/a&gt;, who shared the Nobel prize in 2023 for her pioneering work on the mRNA vaccines, told CNN this week that she moved to the US from Hungary because America offered opportunities to develop innovative science. US scientists in the same position today will not see the same opportunities, she said, and they’ll go where there’s investment in their work.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000o336nntrx2sjm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is really the next generation that will suffer the most,” Karikó told CNN, Wednesday. “When we have the next pandemic other countries will have to help us out.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humanoid robots, robots with a human-like body structure, have so far been primarily tested on manual tasks that entail supporting humans in their daily activities, such as carrying objects, collecting samples in hazardous environments, supporting older adults or acting as physical therapy assistants. In contrast, their potential for completing expressive physical tasks rooted in creative disciplines, such as playing an instrument or participating in performance arts, remains largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                              
                                        
                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at SUPSI, IDSIA and Politecnico di Milano recently introduced &lt;a href="https://robotdrummer.github.io/" target="_blank"&gt;Robot Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, a new humanoid robot that can play the drums both accurately and expressively, supported by a reinforcement learning algorithm. This robot, presented in a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11498" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published on the &lt;i&gt;arXiv&lt;/i&gt; preprint server, was found to gradually acquire human-like behaviors, including movements that are often performed by drummers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The idea for Robot Drummer actually emerged from a spontaneous conversation over coffee with my co-author, Loris Roveda," Asad Ali Shahid, first author of the paper, told Tech Xplore. "We were discussing how humanoid robots have become increasingly capable at a wide range of tasks, but rarely engage in creative and expressive domains. That raised a fascinating question: what if a humanoid robot could take on a creative role, like performing music? Drumming seemed like a perfect frontier, as it's rhythmic, physical, and requires rapid coordination across limbs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main objective of this recent study by Shahid and his colleagues was to develop a machine learning-based system that would allow a humanoid robot to play the drums for entire musical tracks, exhibiting rhythmic skills similar to those of human performers. The system they developed, dubbed Robot Drummer, was successfully evaluated in simulation on the G1 &lt;a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/humanoid+robot/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;humanoid robot&lt;/a&gt;, created by Unitree, allowing it to accurately play real songs on a drum kit.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="2793866484"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"The key idea is that we represent each piece of music as a chain of precisely timed contact events, what we call a rhythmic contact chain," explained Shahid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These contact goals tell the robot which drums to strike and when. The robot then uses this information and learns how to hit the drums by practicing and improving in a simulated environment. What's unique is that the robot develops intelligent behaviors, like dynamically switching sticks, crossing its arms to reach different drums, and optimizing its movements across the kit to adapt to the rhythm—in ways that resemble human drummers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate their system, the researchers tested it on a simulated G1 Unitree robot, assessing its ability to perform popular songs across different genres, from jazz to rock and metal. These included well-known tracks like "In the End" by Linkin Park, "Take Five" by Dave Brubeck and "Living on a Prayer" by Bon Jovi. They found that the robot effectively learned complex rhythmic structures and played the songs with high accuracy, often with a rhythmic precision of over 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More impressively, the robot discovered human-like strategies, such as planning for upcoming strikes, executing cross-arm hits, and reassigning sticks on the fly," said Shahid. "These behaviors emerged entirely by optimizing for rhythmic rewards the robot received during training. In the long term, Robot Drummer could pave the way for robotic performers to accompany live bands on stage, and it provides a framework for teaching precise timing skills in domains beyond music."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;This recent study could soon inspire other research groups to develop machine learning-based tools that allow &lt;a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/humanoid+robots/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;humanoid robots&lt;/a&gt; to play musical instruments or engage in other performance arts. Robot Drummer and other similar systems could prove valuable for the entertainment industry and could eventually be deployed in real-world settings to showcase advancements in robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our next step is to bring Robot Drummer into the real world by transferring learned skills to actual hardware," added Shahid. "We also aim to teach the robot to improvise and adapt its playing style instead of following a 'fixed drum sheet.' For example, we could enable the robot to adjust its timing on-the-fly based on musical cues— essentially giving it the ability to 'feel' and respond to music like a human drummer."&lt;/p&gt;

She was in a graduate program, was working full-time, and had just been the maid of honor at her childhood best friend’s wedding. She was also only 28 years old. “It felt like absolutely everything about me was stripped away at that moment,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;She moved home to begin treatment: six months of chemo, a lumpectomy, and radiation.

Since 1990, the global incidence of early-onset cancer (cancers diagnosed in people younger than 50) has increased by nearly 80 percent and is projected to rise by another 31 percent by 2030, according to a study in &lt;em data-node-id="2.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="BMJ Oncology" data-node-id="2.1.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;BMJ Oncology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. And compared to men under 50, women of the same age have an 82 percent higher rate, up from 51 percent in 2002, according to the American Cancer Society’s most recent &lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/2025CancerFactsandFigures" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pressroom.cancer.org/2025CancerFactsandFigures" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="annual report" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;annual report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-21" data-node-id="4" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1pxfh3s e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-sh2zho e1pe3zr90"&gt;Roughly 103 out of every 100,000 individuals below the age of 50 is diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;On top of all that, young people’s cancers tend to be more aggressive, often because they’re diagnosed at later stages. Colon and rectal cancers lead the uptick with the fastest rate increases, followed by uterine, blood (leukemia), kidney, and breast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Traditionally, one of the biggest risk factors for cancer has been age. Now, being young isn’t the protector it once was, and scientists are disturbed, to say the least.

(Screening ages for some cancers have begun to inch down, but general recommendations haven’t dipped below 40.) For example, people at average risk are advised to start &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a32998464/chrissy-teigen-pap-smear-mammograms-instagram/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a32998464/chrissy-teigen-pap-smear-mammograms-instagram/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="mammograms" data-node-id="10.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;mammograms&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection/american-cancer-society-recommendations-for-the-early-detection-of-breast-cancer.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection/american-cancer-society-recommendations-for-the-early-detection-of-breast-cancer.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="between the ages of 40 and 45" data-node-id="10.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;between the ages of 40 and 45&lt;/a&gt; and colorectal cancer screenings &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="at age 45" data-node-id="10.7" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;at age 45&lt;/a&gt;, according to the American Cancer Society. These ages are recommended partly because of the burden that earlier screenings would put on the medical system and because screening technology that works for older people might not be as effective on younger folks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Mammograms, for one, aren’t as reliable in younger women, who tend to have &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62138347/dense-breasts-mammogram-fda/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62138347/dense-breasts-mammogram-fda/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="denser breast tissue" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;denser breast tissue&lt;/a&gt;, says Ann Partridge, MD, MPH, interim chair of the department of medical oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and cofounder and director of the Program for Young Adults with Breast Cancer. “You’d be looking for needles in haystacks, unfortunately,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There’s still a lot more that researchers need to learn about which individuals are most at risk so they can start screening those candidates earlier. In the meantime, it might feel tempting to turn to pricey private companies that offer cancer-screening blood tests (like Galleri) or whole-body MRI scans (like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a45530775/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-review/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a45530775/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-review/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prenuvo" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Prenuvo&lt;/a&gt;), but those are not quite ready for clinical application yet, says Veda Giri, MD, a medical oncologist and director of the Early Onset Cancer Program at Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-23" data-node-id="13" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1pxfh3s e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-sh2zho e1pe3zr90"&gt;"I honestly don’t even think it crossed doctors’ minds that I could have cancer."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But while we wait for better research, tumors in adults under 50 are only getting bigger—and their symptoms more severe. “If a colon cancer is diagnosed at 42, it wasn’t due to screening; it was due to symptoms,” says Therese Bartholomew Bevers, MD, medical director of the Cancer Prevention Center at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For Jenna Putala, 27, a diagnosis took years to receive. Throughout her college softball career she was riddled with unexplained injuries and other health problems that sent her to an orthopedic surgeon and a neurologist. “No one did any scans,” she remembers. “Doctors just told me, ‘Move on, keep stretching, you’re fine.’” It wasn’t until last year, when a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62754772/chiropractor-cervical-neck-adjustment-stroke-risk/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62754772/chiropractor-cervical-neck-adjustment-stroke-risk/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="chiropractor" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;chiropractor&lt;/a&gt; sent her for an MRI of her back (where the pain originally was), that a scan showed the tip of an eight-centimeter tumor lower down, on her pelvis. Doctors think she’s been living with this PEComa, a rare form of sarcoma, since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Because of the tumor’s size, its placement, and her age, doctors don’t want to remove it; it would alter her quality of life too dramatically. She could lose part of her bowel or sciatic nerve or her pelvis could cave in on itself. Instead, Putala attempted to harvest her eggs to preserve her fertility (but couldn’t because it turned out her tumor was estrogen-sensitive), underwent 40 rounds of radiation, and is on chemo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For the rest of her life, to keep her cancer as manageable as possible, she’ll get regular screenings, go to physical therapy, and try different chemo treatments until they stop working or make her too sick to continue. Today, Putala is back at work and fighting for a sense of normalcy after a “whirlwind” year, but that doesn’t make her prolonged diagnosis any easier to swallow. “I honestly don’t even think it crossed doctors’ minds that I could have cancer,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This is really a moment for everyone to rethink who a cancer patient is. Young women with no family history or obvious risk factor like smoking—women who are doing everything right—are still being diagnosed, so doctors and patients alike shouldn’t rule out the possibility. “I was a college athlete, I went to the gym all the time, I ate healthy,” Putala says. “I was doing all of these things that could help prevent cancer, so why did I get it?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-24" data-node-id="19" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="collage combining human features and elements representing health" title="collage combining human features and elements representing health" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125feacancer-003-6893a0c9e275e.jpg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125feacancer-003-6893a0c9e275e.jpg?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125feacancer-003-6893a0c9e275e.jpg?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125feacancer-003-6893a0c9e275e.jpg?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Blake Cale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-hunt-for-the-cause" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;The Hunt For The Cause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Doctors are racing&lt;strong data-node-id="21.1"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to figure out why cancer rates are rising, but the unsatisfying truth is that there’s not much experts know for sure yet.

Compared to past generations, people today are consuming UPFs at younger and younger ages, potentially meaning that the damage is starting earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;These dietary habit changes can affect our &lt;a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-024-00177-0" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-024-00177-0" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gut microbiom" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;gut microbiom&lt;/a&gt;e, inflammation, and insulin levels—all of which can play a role in developing cancer, says Jeffrey Meyerhardt, MD, MPH, codirector of the Colon and Rectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Younger generations may differ in body composition as well. From 1990 to 2020, adult obesity has doubled while childhood obesity has quadrupled, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight#:~:text=Worldwide%20adult%20obesity%20has%20more,16%25%20were%20living%20with%20obesity." target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight#:~:text=Worldwide%20adult%20obesity%20has%20more,16%25%20were%20living%20with%20obesity." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World Health Organization" data-node-id="24.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has linked obesity with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6754861/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6754861/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="13 different kinds of cancer" data-node-id="24.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;13 different kinds of cancer&lt;/a&gt;, including colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian. “We think it’s because having extra body weight can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64040296/chronic-inflammation-anti-inflammatory-habits-doctors/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64040296/chronic-inflammation-anti-inflammatory-habits-doctors/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="chronic inflammation" data-node-id="24.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;,” says Dr. Bevers. Extra weight might also impact sex hormones, which play a role in some cancers, and insulin levels, which can be a growth factor for cancer, says Dr. Meyerhardt. (On the other hand, muscle is actually associated with improved insulin sensitivity, he says.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;No surprise that physical activity also probably has a hand in this. Moving—and exercise—are thought to decrease cancer risk because of their effect on the factors we’ve been talking about: inflammation, insulin, body composition, and hormones, says Dr. Meyerhardt. While it doesn’t explain the rising cancer rates in younger people specifically, globally, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-06-2024-nearly-1.8-billion-adults-at-risk-of-disease-from-not-doing-enough-physical-activity" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-06-2024-nearly-1.8-billion-adults-at-risk-of-disease-from-not-doing-enough-physical-activity" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="one-third of adults" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;one-third of adults&lt;/a&gt; didn’t meet the recommended physical activity levels in 2022. That’s up by about five percentage points from 2010, and this number is expected only to increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;These potential risk factors leave us with as many questions as answers, especially among people who have none of them. “Diet, activity, obesity—that’s not going to explain everything,” says Dr. Meyerhardt.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-what-can-you-do-now" data-node-id="28" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;So, What Can You Do Now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Bear in mind:&lt;strong data-node-id="29.1"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Cancer at younger ages is still not super common. (We’re talking roughly 103 out of every 100,000 individuals, according to a study in &lt;em data-node-id="29.3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2808381" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2808381" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="JAMA Network Open" data-node-id="29.3.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.) Rather than freaking out (because who wouldn’t?), it’s best to focus on being proactive, says Dr. Giri. There are things you can do—and they’re all pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="30" class="body-h4 css-8naf72 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="30.0"&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="30.1"&gt; Keep up with the basics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s not the most exciting thing you’ve ever heard, but the core tenets of Healthy Living 101 apply here. Eat well (focus as much as possible on whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and limit highly processed foods, sugar, and red meat); hit 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity each week; get the recommended vaccines, especially for HPV; and avoid smoking and drinking as much as you can. Alcohol and tobacco are Group 1 carcinogens, per &lt;a href="https://monographs.iarc.who.int/list-of-classifications/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://monographs.iarc.who.int/list-of-classifications/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the IARC" data-node-id="31.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;the IARC&lt;/a&gt;, which means there’s sufficient evidence to classify them as carcinogenic to humans. UV light is also a Group 1 carcinogen—so protect yourself from the sun too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="32" class="body-h4 css-8naf72 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="32.0"&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="32.1"&gt; Flag your symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Any new lump, unexplained weight loss, change in bowel habits (like blood in your stool or black tar-like stools), abdominal pain, or cough is a symptom to take seriously, says Dr. Bevers. The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms-of-cancer.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms-of-cancer.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Cancer Society" data-node-id="33.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; also lists fatigue or extreme tiredness, eating problems, skin changes, unusual bleeding or bruising, and bladder changes as potential signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That might sound like a broad list, but the bottom line is this: “Whether it’s a new lump, a new pain, a new discomfort—something that’s just different and not going away—be sure to bring it to your doctor,” says Dr. Giri. Feeling like something is off can give rise to a range of emotions, she adds, including fear, guilt, and shame, but it’s important to not let that stop you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s a rule Harris has lived by ever since her diagnosis. After she offhandedly mentioned to her doctor that her throat swelled and felt itchy one evening while at a friend’s house, her doctor sent her for an ultrasound, which is how they discovered her thyroid cancer. Now, “any small concern—even if I think it might sound stupid, even if it’s embarrassing, I really don’t care—I bring it up to my doctors,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And if you mention it to your physician and they blow it off or their recommendation doesn’t help? “Don’t feel discouraged. Bring it back to them,” says Dr. Giri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="body-h4 css-1ho78k8 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="37.0"&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="37.1"&gt; Get a clear picture of your risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Risk assessment is a key to avoiding a too-late diagnosis and to giving yourself more options, and it’s something anyone and everyone should be doing, per experts. When Alison Hall, 33, calculated her breast cancer risk assessment score—using the same free online tool that &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a60189322/olivia-munn-luminal-b-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a60189322/olivia-munn-luminal-b-breast-cancer/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Olivia Munn" data-node-id="38.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Olivia Munn&lt;/a&gt; used (the &lt;a href="https://magview.com/ibis-risk-calculator/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://magview.com/ibis-risk-calculator/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Assessment Calculator" data-node-id="38.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Assessment Calculator&lt;/a&gt;)—she discovered that she had a 36 percent risk, which is a low score on a math test but high when it comes to cancer risk. A doctor told her to start getting biannual screenings. Her first mammogram was clear, but an MRI just six months later found cancer in its earliest stage of malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hall opted for a double mastectomy. “I don’t want to spend the rest of my life looking down at my breasts and wondering what is going on in there,” she says. Plus, the alternative, a lumpectomy and 5 to 10 years of hormone therapy, would delay her family planning by several years (and might have raised the risk of a recurrence during or after pregnancy, as a result of fluctuating hormones).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="40" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;A large part of calculating your risk involves understanding your family history of cancer—which isn’t always easy to do. You can plug this info into an online risk calculator, like the one Munn and Hall used, Dana-Farber’s &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/community-health/assess-your-risk" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.dana-farber.org/community-health/assess-your-risk" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Assess Your Risk" data-node-id="40.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Assess Your Risk&lt;/a&gt; tool, the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/family-health-history/communication-resources/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/family-health-history/communication-resources/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="My Family Health Portrait: Cancer Edition" data-node-id="40.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;My Family Health Portrait: Cancer Edition&lt;/a&gt; (an app), or the ACS’s &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/cancer-risk-360.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/cancer-risk-360.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CancerRisk360" data-node-id="40.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;CancerRisk360&lt;/a&gt;. But ideally, once you’ve gathered your data, you can bring it to your doctor and ask about next steps. “I certainly didn’t have this on my bingo card, but the earlier that things are caught, the better,” Hall says. Instead of being scared by the prospect of finding things out, she says, “see it as something you can be empowered by.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="42" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;How To Find Out Your Family History&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For people with a family history of certain cancers—including breast, ovarian, uterine, and colorectal—screening and testing might be recommended at younger ages, even up to 10 years earlier than when your relative was first diagnosed. But that means finding out your family’s health history. There are plenty of reasons someone might not be able to access much info about their blood relatives’ medical histories, and that’s okay, says Dr. Giri. Doctors are able to work with the info you do have and can help sleuth out as much as possible. But here’s what to aim to get details on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="44" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="44.0"&gt;If you can speak to relatives about their health history, find out this info:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="45" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="45.0"&gt;Ask if they ever had cancer, what kind it was (keep in mind that sometimes people have multiple types, which is helpful to know), and the age they were diagnosed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="45.1"&gt;Inquire about your grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins (living and deceased). Sometimes doctors can identify generational patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="46" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="46.0"&gt;Ease into the conversation with these strategies:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="47" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="47.0"&gt;Think about the best people to turn to, both in terms of who you suspect will be most receptive and who will have the most information. Some families have one person who knows a lot about the entire clan, Dr. Giri says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="47.1"&gt;Be strategic about when to talk—when everyone is around for the holidays, or in private with certain people? Hard conversations like those about health and cancer might need to unfold over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="47.2"&gt;Be prepared to explain why you’re asking.

Once the mosquito population surges, it takes just one infected traveler from India or Thailand to kickstart local transmission. We’ve seen similar patterns in France, Italy, and now in Florida, where U.S. officials are reporting dengue cases.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ciprg" data-offset-key="bt5ca-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bt5ca-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bt5ca-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Leshem added that China has implemented a wide range of response strategies. “These include conventional tactics like spraying insecticides, draining standing water, using mosquito nets, and applying repellents. But in typical Chinese fashion, there are also strict public health enforcement measures: people face hefty fines for keeping water-filled flower pots, mosquito-eating fish are being released into ponds, and in some cases, patients are being hospitalized against their will.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ciprg" data-offset-key="5kh4l-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5kh4l-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5kh4l-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;While the risk of a similar outbreak in Israel is currently low, Prof. Leshem cautioned that it’s not out of the question. “We know these types of mosquitoes are present in Israel, and from time to time, we do identify chikungunya cases. It’s certainly a possibility, as we saw with last year’s West Nile virus outbreak.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ciprg" data-offset-key="6k2dk-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6k2dk-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6k2dk-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Chikungunya is spread by infected Aedes mosquitoes—the same species responsible for transmitting dengue and Zika viruses. Symptoms include high fever and debilitating joint pain, which can last for months.

                            &lt;p&gt;What is most fascinating about Ozempic isn’t the weight loss. It’s the psychological revolution it has triggered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something extraordinary is happening to people who’ve spent years, even decades, locked in a mental war with food. Again and again, I hear the same phrase from the medicalised weight-loss army: the “food noise” has stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when the jabs stop? &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/ozempic-patients-need-support-for-a-year-after-treatment-xhh9fhsp8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A recent report&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; suggested that patients may need a full year of support after coming off Ozempic. I’d say that’s the bare minimum. Because once the food noise returns, so does the weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients plan to taper off gradually, while others hope to stay on a maintenance dose indefinitely. But for many, going off the drug brings a risk of “Ozempic rebound” — the return of weight and cravings. Sustaining weight loss typically requires lasting lifestyle changes, as most users report a surge in appetite once the injections stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there are also accounts from people who say their cravings never returned, even after discontinuing the medication. If true, this raises a critical question: are these drugs doing more than suppressing appetite in the short term? Could they be reshaping long-term behaviour and not just altering brain chemistry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some slim people seem oddly irked by Ozempic. We’ve long treated body weight as a reflection of character. Thinness is seen as discipline, virtue, self-control. Obesity is framed as a moral failure — greedy, lazy, slobbish. Katie Hopkins once &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/british-tv-personality-katie-hopkins-gained-lost-weight/story?id=28216895" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt; to prove how easy it is to lose weight by deliberately gaining it. She had to force herself to eat, found the whole process unpleasant and difficult, and eventually, after much effort, she gained weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for a whole cohort of people, the reverse is true. They live in a near-constant state of hunger, tormented by a 24/7 food soundtrack. And still the weight piles on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozempic challenges this old narrative. Suddenly, it’s not about willpower or virtue — it’s about biology. And the implications go far beyond individual weight loss. The potential public health benefits are huge: lower rates of diabetes, heart disease, and even some obesity-related cancers. This could be the next statin or thalidomide. We don’t know yet, which is why we need to think very carefully about how we are using these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because we still have no quality research to show what happens in the long term. And already, serious concerns are emerging. The &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6jg6nw2zeo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of North Lanarkshire nurse Susan McGowan, 58, last September is believed to be the first in the UK officially linked to weight-loss medication. And across the country, regulators have now received &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2025/jun/concerns-grow-as-slimming-injections-tied-to-more-than-100-uk-fatalities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of more than 100 deaths potentially linked to drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro — though these cases remain unconfirmed and may involve other contributing health factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also countless reports of people self-medicating online. Singer Avery &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFVjSc5pUjJ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recently revealed&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram that she developed osteoporosis at 30 after taking a weight-loss drug without a prescription. “I DO have an eating disorder, and I did NOT get Ozempic from a doctor. It is very easy to get,” she said.  Online self-medication isn’t new. What’s new is how easy it has become, and how little scrutiny there seems to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question now is not just what happens next, but how we support people when the drugs wear off, stop working, or begin to cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="midcontent3" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                            
                                                        &lt;hr&gt;

                            &lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p class="staticendofarticle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p class="staticendofarticle2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;

Untreated, it causes serious liver damage over the course of decades, leading to much higher rates of cirrhosis and liver cancer, all of which is very expensive to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But in the 2010s, a number of extremely effective antivirals, which randomized trials show &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M16-2575"&gt;cure upwards of 95 percent of chronic infections&lt;/a&gt;, came on the market. Like most new drugs, these antivirals are &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/availability/generic-sovaldi.html"&gt;under patent&lt;/a&gt; and quite expensive; as of 2020, the cost of an eight-to-twelve week course of the drugs, usually enough to cure an infection, was &lt;a href="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/millimaninc5660-milliman6442-prod27d5-0001/media/Milliman/PDFs/2021-Articles/6-11-21-Analysis-prescription-drugs-treatment-hepatitis-C-US.pdf"&gt;between $11,500 and $17,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yet CBO concludes that the drugs are so effective, and the costs of treating patients with hep C who haven’t been cured are so massive, that expanding treatment with these drugs reduces federal spending on hep C treatment and associated complications overall. Doubling the number of Medicaid patients getting the drugs would increase federal spending by $4 billion over 10 years. But over the same decade, the federal government would save $7 billion through reduced need for treatments like liver transplants and ongoing care for chronic cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Put like that, this starts to sound like one of the rarest discoveries in federal budgeting: a free lunch. That means a policy that is good on its own merits (saving lives and preventing debilitating chronic disease) but also saves the government money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the most interesting part of the report to me comes at the end. “An increase in hepatitis C treatment could also affect the federal budget in other ways—for example, by leading to improved longevity and lower rates of disability,” the authors note. The latter point is pretty straightforward: If hepatitis C leads to disabilities that make people eligible for disability insurance and subsidized health coverage, then reduced hep C means lower spending on those programs. But (and this is me speculating, so blame me and not the CBO if I’m wrong) that effect is probably swamped by that of “improved longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Simply put: curing hep C means people live longer, which means they spend more years collecting Social Security, Medicare, and other benefits. That could mean that whatever cost savings the actual hep C treatment produces might be wiped out by the fact that the people whose lives are being saved will be cashing retirement checks for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I like to call it the Grim Reaper effect. The US runs a large budget deficit. It also provides far more generous benefits to seniors than to children or working-age adults. Per the &lt;a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/kids-share-2024"&gt;Urban Institute’s regular report on government spending for children&lt;/a&gt;, the ratio of per capita spending on senior citizens to per capita spending on children is over 5 to 1. Put together, the deficit and the elder-biased composition of federal spending implies something that is equally important and macabre: helping people live longer lives will, all else being equal, be bad for the federal budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In an &lt;a href="/the-highlight/23850582/millennials-aging-parents-boomers-seniors-family-care-taker"&gt;increasingly aging country&lt;/a&gt;, hep C is not the first place where the Grim Reaper effect has been felt, and it won’t be the last. I don’t have an easy fix for the situation, but it feels important to at least understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One of the first and clearest cases of this longevity dilemma in budgeting came with cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The history of mass cigarette smoking in the US is surprisingly short. Per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4843a2.htm"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, American adults were only smoking 54 cigarettes annually per capita as of 1900. By 1963, that number had grown to 4,345. The development of automatic rolling machines, &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/11795/chapter/4#42"&gt;milder forms of tobacco&lt;/a&gt;, and mass marketing meant millions of working and middle-class Americans became pack-a-day smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But while the per capita average floated around 4,000 from the late ‘40s to the early ‘70s, it then began a precipitous decline. In 2022, the most recent year for which the &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2022-Cigarette-Report.pdf"&gt;Federal Trade Commission released data&lt;/a&gt;, Americans bought 173.5 billion cigarettes, or 667 per &lt;a href="https://datacenter.aecf.org/data/tables/99-total-population-by-child-and-adult-populations#detailed/1/any/false/1095/40/416,417"&gt;adult&lt;/a&gt;, less than a sixth of the peak, while fewer than &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/research/trends-in-lung-disease/tobacco-trends-brief/overall-smoking-trends"&gt;12 percent of American adults now smoke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Cigarettes are, of course, deadly, but they kill with a lag, usually after decades of regular smoking. That meant that in the late 1980s and 1990s, the US started to hit peak cigarette deaths, as adults who came of age during the smoking era started to get lung cancer and emphysema en masse, at numbers that less-addicted subsequent generations wouldn’t match. The male &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/smoking#the-rise-and-fall-of-lung-cancer"&gt;death rate from lung cancer peaked&lt;/a&gt; in 1990, and the female death rate peaked in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A flurry of economic research at the time tried to make sense of what this meant for the federal budget. Smoking harms your health. But it also shortens your lifespan. A useful &lt;a href="https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/105th-congress-1997-1998/reports/tobacco.pdf"&gt;1998 Congressional Budget Office report&lt;/a&gt; noted that most research found that, over their lives, smokers spend more in health care costs (including more that goes on the federal tab) than non-smokers, even accounting for their shorter lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But that picture changed once you added in pensions and other non-health spending. Economists John Shoven, Jeffrey Sundberg, and John Bunker in 1989 estimated that the &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c11584/c11584.pdf"&gt;average male smoker saved Social Security $20,000&lt;/a&gt; (about $60,000 today) in benefits not paid. The figure for women, who live longer than men on average but earn less in wages and thus in Social Security, was about half that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It seems likely that the Federal budget currently benefits from smoking,” &lt;a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/19940308_94-214_5714418e1b0a5c7cba975ddcfda7c1c0aaee0f61.pdf"&gt;two Congressional Research Service researchers concluded&lt;/a&gt; in 1994, when the “benefits” of early death to Social Security and Medicare were included. Malcolm Gladwell, in a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/02/27/not-smoking-could-be-hazardous-to-pension-system/0c2151ba-c38a-400d-aab5-bd45a5ba80ec/"&gt;thoughtful 1990 treatment of the problem in the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, was catchier: “Not Smoking Could be Hazardous to Pension System.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Decades later, the &lt;a href="https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/Smoking_One-Col.pdf"&gt;CBO did a fuller analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the budgetary consequences of smoking in the aftermath of the large cigarette tax increase President Obama signed in early 2009 and proposals for further hikes. At first blush, the revenue raised from a cigarette tax should be easy to estimate: multiply annual cigarette sales by the amount of the tax. But obviously raising the price of the good will reduce the amount people buy; one major reason for cigarette taxes, after all, is to deter smoking. The CBO used a price elasticity of -0.3, meaning that a 10 percent increase in cigarette prices reduces the number sold by 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the 2012 report was meant to go a step or two further, according to then-director Doug Elmendorf, who explained the backstory in a recent conversation with me. “The effects of making people healthier are good for those people, obviously, but also perhaps good for the federal budget because the federal government pays for a lot of health care. If you’re healthier, you don’t need so much health care.” But at the same time, “It was clear that if people were healthier, they would live longer, and that could have budgetary costs. It wasn’t obvious offhand what the balance of those effects would be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The 2012 CBO report tried to put all these effects together: the effect of lower smoking on reducing health-care spending (including government-funded spending) due to a healthier population, the effect on Social Security and other benefit spending from resulting longer lifespans, the effect of lower smoking rates on wages, and tax revenue from those wages. (The latter is often not included in formal CBO scores, as it tips closer to “dynamic” scoring where the effect of legislation on the overall economy is included.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the first 10 years after a hike in the cigarette tax, they found that having a healthier population was more of a blessing than a curse, budget-wise. The health effects of a cigarette tax hike reduced federal health spending by over $900 million over a decade, even after accounting for people living longer and claiming more years of Medicare. By contrast, retirement programs only spent $183 million more because people lived longer. Swamping all that was a $2.9 billion increase in tax revenue from a healthier population capable of working and earning more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But that’s just the 10-year effect. As the decades pass, the effect of longevity would grow and grow. First, Medicare costs would start to rise, as the cost of a longer-lived population began to swamp the cost savings of that population being healthier overall. (Even people who’ve been healthy for a long time can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1282187/#:~:text=CURRENT%20FINANCING,$%2029%20billion%2C%20respectively2."&gt;run up major health spending at the end of their now longer lives&lt;/a&gt;.) Social Security costs would keep rising, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Fifty years in, these costs would overwhelm the benefits, and the cigarette tax’s health effects would start costing the budget, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The point isn’t “cigarette taxes are good” or “cigarette taxes are bad.” The point is that &lt;em&gt;even a policy that saves lives&lt;/em&gt; isn’t necessarily a slam dunk from the hard-eyed perspective of budget policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Recent years provided a possibly even darker example. In 2022, the &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/2022-medicare-trustees-report.pdf#page=8"&gt;Medicare Trustees pushed back the date&lt;/a&gt; they expected the program’s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to be depleted by two years. They had several reasons, but a major one was that Covid-19 had killed hundreds of thousands of Medicare patients prematurely. Not only that, but “Medicare beneficiaries whose deaths were identified as related to COVID had costs that were much higher than the average Medicare beneficiary prior to the onset of the pandemic.” Put another way: Covid killed off Medicare’s sickest, and most expensive, enrollees. That meant the program was left with an overall healthier population, which by itself lowered medical costs by 2.9 percent in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Similarly, a paper by a team of health economists earlier this year estimated that the 1.4 million excess deaths in the US due to Covid had &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w33465"&gt;the net effect of boosting the Social Security trust fund to the tune of $156 billion&lt;/a&gt;. That represented $219 billion in benefits that no longer needed to be sent, minus $44 billion in lower payroll tax revenues and $25 billion in new benefits to surviving family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It all reminds one of &lt;em&gt;Logan’s Run&lt;/em&gt;, in which people are killed off upon hitting age 30 lest they take up too many of society’s resources. That movie is a dystopia — but as a budget proposal, it’d score very well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="its-good-to-save-lives-actually" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;It’s good to save lives, actually&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The economists and agencies doing this math are, of course, only doing their jobs. We need to know what government programs will cost over the near- and long-run. These effects on health and life and death matter to those calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Members of Congress regularly thought that we were ghoulish for talking about how, if people live longer, there’ll be higher benefits for Social Security,” Elmendorf recalls. “But it’s not ghoulish. Obviously, we want to live longer and members of Congress should try to help all Americans live longer. CBO’s job — an analyst’s job in general — is just to be honest about the likely effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the fact that increased human longevity &lt;em&gt;on its own&lt;/em&gt; worsens the budget picture should lead to some reflection. For one thing, it suggests that sometimes we should embrace policies simply because they’re the right thing to do, even if they don’t pay for themselves. Recall the hepatitis C treatments that prevent expensive long-term expenses for Medicaid, but might add on new costs by extending the benefits’ lifespans. It’s possible that, upon taking the latter into account, expanding access to hep C drugs costs the government money on net. It’s a free lunch no longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s not a reason not to embrace the policy, though. Lots of things the government does cost money. The military doesn’t pay for itself. K–12 schools don’t pay for themselves. Smithsonian Museums don’t pay for themselves. That doesn’t mean those aren’t important functions that it makes sense to put some of our tax dollars toward. Hep C treatment, I think, fits in that list, even if it’s not literally free from a budget standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Congress should also allow agencies like the CBO to do more to symmetrically account for the positive budgetary effects of longevity, along with the negatives. People who live longer, after all, often earn wages in those new years of life, wages that generate income and payroll tax revenues for the federal government. Moreover, people at the end of their careers are earning more money and hence paying more taxes than young people, meaning life extension helping people in their 50s and 60s might be especially good for tax revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The problem is that the CBO generally considers “how many workers paying taxes are there” to be an economic effect and only considers it in &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w33425"&gt;special “dynamic” scores&lt;/a&gt; of legislation, in which the economic consequences of them are taken into account. Dynamic scoring has been a topic of great controversy for decades, going back at least to the Bush II administration, but the rule Congress sets for CBO on when to use dynamic scoring results in CBO applying dynamic scoring very rarely in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A middle ground option, though, would be something &lt;a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/1/18/population-change-effect-immigration-policies-on-federal-budget"&gt;called “population change” scoring&lt;/a&gt;, in which CBO considers the direct effects of a change in the population (through longer lifespans, say, or immigration) on the level of employment and tax revenue, without doing a full, more complicated dynamic score. That would make its accounting of the effects of longer lives less biased: the budgetary benefits would be counted alongside the costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We should also consider the aspects of our budget situation that make the longevity effect a reality. One is the US’s long-standing, bipartisan choice to run massive budget deficits, even during relative boom times. One arithmetic consequence of that choice is that it makes the continued existence of every American a net loss for the country’s books. That’s not the main reason to &lt;a href="/policy/367278/us-national-debt-gdp-government-inflation-solutions-recession"&gt;avoid large deficits during booms&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s a somewhat toxic byproduct all the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The other aspect driving this effect is the choice to invest government resources very heavily in seniors relative to other age groups. This is due in large measure to the US choice to provide universal health care for seniors but not other age groups, and due to our lack of investment in &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/data/datasets/family-database/pf1_6_public_spending_by_age_of_children.pdf#page=3"&gt;very young children&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goingdigital.oecd.org/en/indicator/42"&gt;working-age adults&lt;/a&gt; compared to other rich nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is no law of nature saying the US has to weigh its priorities that way. As long as we do, the numbers will imply that it’s better for the budget for people to die before they get old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNRnd5SEFTZlFjMFdseldXa2dzaFBBNjNwcHBDY2lTSXhvRjJRNThrdjFOYW0zRVpzS3ZCVm5XdHVSWGxpYnBFejlpa0xlN2JkNExuWnRDb1FqWm9NVGVlNHQ2djBmb01WYnU4ZnF4WHlLdnNfaVI0ell0eHJ4cFU2UExva29WNEV2Rldv</guid></item><item><title>随着感染激增，寻找麻疹治疗方法的竞赛-华尔街日报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQTWVMb1duVm01ZUNKdHdSRTdRSDhmUVRuR0VSelozWUNhY3pQaHhFTjNxeWZndmp2MjNNZGdWQ29GMnlrYzBvTHNxRFpKQnA0T1NMTkRxTWhTM2s4dHozZVdOT1BzaGI3Yk9VY2xCUXBVS2wya3AwMHg3ZklWTnV0THBHOUM4WHdhUk9fVTEzVTJfbDk0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQTWVMb1duVm01ZUNKdHdSRTdRSDhmUVRuR0VSelozWUNhY3pQaHhFTjNxeWZndmp2MjNNZGdWQ29GMnlrYzBvTHNxRFpKQnA0T1NMTkRxTWhTM2s4dHozZVdOT1BzaGI3Yk9VY2xCUXBVS2wya3AwMHg3ZklWTnV0THBHOUM4WHdhUk9fVTEzVTJfbDk0</guid></item><item><title>所以你碰了毒藤。现在怎么办？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5GMTNRVkJReWo2eFc5RzRGUk1zTTFNNG53QXpDc1M0TFk1WkxZVUdob2REbVZ4UUpUeFVqNzN6VGNJYjluRU9pNnRmdWx3ZVE4NjlRWlZOTzA3bl9sc0NtRmZaZ0VKdFdiZXNlU1Y5Z2xuRUJyVXVtSWl3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 09:00:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE5GMTNRVkJReWo2eFc5RzRGUk1zTTFNNG53QXpDc1M0TFk1WkxZVUdob2REbVZ4UUpUeFVqNzN6VGNJYjluRU9pNnRmdWx3ZVE4NjlRWlZOTzA3bl9sc0NtRmZaZ0VKdFdiZXNlU1Y5Z2xuRUJyVXVtSWl3</guid></item><item><title>所以你碰了毒藤。现在怎么办？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOc3dDZkZyNHRtRkRVOEJPblRlWUN4bVFkeU1CemdmVDgyYTVHOFVJaHlRYW5xZjZ1V2FXbk5QTnE4WlRhVW53Yk03SU5hd1h3ZWpmcUhrRHBYNFBXTmNpWk0ydEVMaDlUaHNudllwejVtdzV0eHd2M3FlcGFvNmlYZ0tnaTIzUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 09:00:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOc3dDZkZyNHRtRkRVOEJPblRlWUN4bVFkeU1CemdmVDgyYTVHOFVJaHlRYW5xZjZ1V2FXbk5QTnE4WlRhVW53Yk03SU5hd1h3ZWpmcUhrRHBYNFBXTmNpWk0ydEVMaDlUaHNudllwejVtdzV0eHd2M3FlcGFvNmlYZ0tnaTIzUQ</guid></item><item><title>“我们希望节省这笔投资” ：倡导在产妇保健资金耗尽之前争取获得产妇保健资金- ProPublica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQY2ZjTm5nOGNmVHg0SVlDRFBZTHFLUGQ4NjU3aHh4OW81bXh5UGluS0dyY3RfZ3JucEVheENmWTZoY3duRkd1ODUzNUExM2lYR0Zab3BWb3hsdXBRYjEtU1JGNld4ZGZUX2pLc0FHZDJFZ1lZd3ZwN3czOVJtOEJaRA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" data-pp-location="article body"&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0"&gt;Seven years ago, when President Donald Trump signed the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act into law, it was hailed as a crucial step toward addressing the nation’s maternal mortality crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0"&gt;The law pumped tens of millions of dollars a year into a program to help fund state committees that review maternal deaths and identify their causes. The committees’ findings have led to new protocols to prevent hemorrhage, sepsis and suicide. Federal money has allowed some states to establish panels for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0"&gt;The committees’ work only became more urgent after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Last year, Georgia’s committee &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/candi-miller-abortion-ban-death-georgia"&gt;determined the state’s abortion ban contributed to the preventable death of 41-year-old Candi Miller&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0"&gt;But now the program that enabled this progress — known as Enhancing Reviews and Surveillance to Eliminate Maternal Mortality, or ERASE MM — is in danger, maternal health advocates say.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0"&gt;The program’s funding expires on Sept. 30, and efforts to renew it have thus far not succeeded. Congress included money to extend ERASE MM in a broader stopgap funding measure that almost passed in December 2024 before being scuttled by Republican opposition. The program isn’t paid for in the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2026-aha-cj.pdf"&gt;budget proposal for 2026&lt;/a&gt;. Late last week, the Senate Appropriations Committee introduced a bill to fund the Department of Health and Human Services for the next fiscal year that includes money for ERASE MM, but the measure hasn’t moved forward yet.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0"&gt;Adrienne Griffen, executive director of the Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance, said she fears how little attention the program’s fraught future has drawn amid waves of layoffs at federal health agencies and ferocious debate over &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-medicaid-cuts-texas-residents"&gt;impending Medicaid cuts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0"&gt;“We were concerned when the president’s budget did not include these programs,” Griffen said. “While we are happy with the progress, there is still a lot that needs to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is responsible for awarding ERASE MM grants and guiding the work of state maternal mortality committees, didn’t answer specific questions from ProPublica about the future of the program. Andrew Nixon, communications director for HHS, the CDC’s parent agency, said in a statement that HHS “is committed to improving maternal and infant health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0"&gt;“We are currently reviewing the maternal and infant health portfolio to identify the most effective ways to collect and analyze data and improve the health and safety of mothers and infants,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0"&gt;HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn’t respond to requests for comment on whether advocates’ concerns are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0"&gt;The Trump administration’s budget proposal jettisons not only ERASE MM but a slate of programs known as the &lt;a href="https://amchp.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CDC_SafeMotherhood_073124.pdf"&gt;Safe Motherhood initiative&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to reduce risks such as premature births and infections that affect mothers and infants. All previously had bipartisan support. That’s left some members of Congress mystified about why their funding is in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0"&gt;At a June budget hearing, Rep. Greg Landsman, D-Ohio, pressed Kennedy on why the administration had proposed eliminating the programs, including ERASE MM.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0"&gt;“I genuinely believed this was zeroed out either accidentally or by some sort of oversight,” Landsman said, asking Kennedy to work with members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to restore funding.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0"&gt;After their exchange at the hearing, Landsman told ProPublica that Kennedy had agreed to meet to discuss restoring the funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.1"&gt;“We want to save this investment,” he said. “It’s critical for expecting moms.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0"&gt;ERASE MM came about in 2019 after &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/lost-mothers"&gt;reporting by ProPublica&lt;/a&gt; and others showed that hundreds of American women were dying each year from preventable causes related to pregnancy. U.S. maternal mortality rates had risen sharply over two decades as rates in other affluent nations had dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0"&gt;Other countries, particularly the United Kingdom, had reliable national data on maternal mortality, as well as robust case-review systems designed to turn information into improvements in care. In the U.S., by contrast, only two-thirds of states had review processes at all and even those sometimes went years between reports or operated inconsistently.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0"&gt;ERASE MM was designed to plug these holes, ensuring that lessons from maternal deaths didn’t go unlearned.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0"&gt;Over the last five years, the CDC has distributed nearly &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/abortion-bans-deaths-state-maternal-mortality-committees"&gt;$90 million&lt;/a&gt; to fund the work of state review committees. At least by federal standards, the program is relatively inexpensive; it divvied up a total of about $40 million last year between 46 states, an average of $870,000 apiece.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0"&gt;The members of maternal mortality review committees — usually a mix of physicians, nurses, mental health professionals and advocates — volunteer their time. ERASE MM grants typically pay to hire the staffers who gather records from hospitals, medical examiners, police and other agencies and abstractors who redact private information from case summaries.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0"&gt;Committees are advisory in nature, but their findings have made a difference, advocates say. In recent years, many states have developed mental health initiatives for pregnant people and new mothers based on maternal mortality reviews. Recommendations by New Hampshire’s committee, for example, led to a program in which OB-GYNs collaborate with psychiatrists on treatments for post-partum depression or substance use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0"&gt;In Indiana, which used ERASE MM funds to establish a maternal mortality review committee in 2018, the panel’s work spurred state officials to expand an initiative to have nurses make post-partum home visits to new mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0"&gt;Indiana is one of at least five states that rely entirely on federal dollars to pay for their maternal mortality reviews (the others are South Carolina, Iowa, Missouri and Utah). Committee members in several states expressed alarm that this money may evaporate.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0"&gt;Before ERASE MM, Utah had a joint committee that reviewed both infant and maternal deaths, said Dr. Marcela Smid, a maternal-fetal health specialist. Utah set up a maternal mortality review committee for the first time in 2019 using funds from ERASE MM, which Smid chairs. It found increasing numbers of maternal deaths by suicide, leading to programs for better mental heath and substance use disorder screening and treatment. Since 2021, the committee has received about $1.7 million from the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0"&gt;“If we get defunded, I suspect it would be devastating,” Smid said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0"&gt;As part of reviews, committee members consider the legal and socioeconomic context in which a woman dies. Those steps were critical in Georgia when the committee reviewed deaths that had occurred after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022 and the state prohibited abortion. The CDC hasn’t directed committees to ask explicitly about such laws, but committee members say the process has provided a window that could be lost if ERASE MM ends.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0"&gt;Case reviews are typically confidential, but ProPublica reported last year that Georgia’s committee had concluded the abortion-related deaths of Miller and &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-abortion-ban-amber-thurman-death"&gt;Amber Thurman&lt;/a&gt;, 28, had been preventable.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0"&gt;Reviewers found both women had taken abortion pills and suffered a rare complication when they failed to expel all the fetal tissue from their bodies. Miller decided not to go to the doctor when she began having symptoms of sepsis because she feared repercussions related to the state’s abortion ban, the review committee found. Thurman went to the hospital but died after doctors waited 20 hours to perform a dilation and curettage to clear her uterus; the procedure, also used to perform abortions, had become entangled in restrictions subjecting doctors to criminal penalties if they violated the law.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0"&gt;Even before the threat to ERASE MM’s funding emerged, four states, including Florida and Texas, had opted out of accepting money from the program. The Florida Department of Health didn’t respond to questions from ProPublica about why it had done this. The Texas Department of Health said the state Legislature had instructed it not to take the funds and instead allocated funding to create its own system. Texas, which accounts for about 10% of U.S. maternal deaths, also stopped sharing data collected by its maternal mortality review committee with the CDC shortly after restricting abortion access.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0"&gt;Officials at the Texas Department of Health also have chosen not to have the state’s maternal mortality review committee examine cases from 2022 and 2023, a period that includes &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/nevaeh-crain-death-texas-abortion-ban-emtala"&gt;two preventable deaths&lt;/a&gt; ProPublica &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/porsha-ngumezi-miscarriage-death-texas-abortion-ban"&gt;reported on last year&lt;/a&gt;. The panel was nearly four years behind on case reviews, and state officials said skipping two years would help it catch up. The state also &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/abortion-bans-deaths-state-maternal-mortality-committees"&gt;forbids its panel&lt;/a&gt; from investigating deaths related to abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0"&gt;Dr. Thomas Westover, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who also sits on the maternal mortality review committee in New Jersey, said he worries that if ERASE MM goes away, there will be no consistency from state to state in how maternal deaths are reviewed or what data is collected on them.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0"&gt;“You’ll have states that pick and choose what to review,” Westover said. He noted that some states likely would ignore accidental deaths to manage their caseloads, while others, like Texas, choose to exclude deaths related to abortions, making data less comparable nationally. “That’s a bad decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0"&gt;As part of ERASE MM, the CDC gives state review committees detailed guidance on what contributing factors to consider when assessing maternal deaths, including obesity, mental health issues, substance abuse and homicide.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0"&gt;This information fuels analysis that goes well beyond what’s in death certificates, said Amy Raines-Milenkov, an associate professor at the University of North Texas Health Science Center and longtime maternal health scholar-practitioner. Based on this information, Texas expanded nurse home visits to post-partum mothers that’s similar to Indiana’s initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0"&gt;“What we choose to measure is what we value in society,” Raines-Milenkov said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0"&gt;Maternal health advocates say they’re working together to bring national attention to the potential funding threat to ERASE MM. Griffen, the executive director of the Maternal Mental Health Leadership Alliance, said she’s hopeful with more meetings on Capitol Hill that a solution can secure the program.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0"&gt;Women’s lives depend on it, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Americans have never heard of it. But this neglected tropical disease is no longer confined to the tropics. It’s here, in the United States, spreading silently in wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease can lie dormant in the human body for years before leading to heart failure, stroke, arrhythmias, or sudden death. Once symptoms appear, the damage is often irreversible. The parasite is spread by &lt;a href="https://kissingbug.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;triatomine insects&lt;/a&gt;, also known as “kissing bugs,” which feed on the blood of infected animals like raccoons, opossums, and rodents. They defecate near the bite, and if the feces enter broken skin or mucous membranes, the parasite can infect humans. In rare cases, it has also been transmitted via organ transplant, blood transfusion, and congenital exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although Chagas disease is endemic to Latin America and a major public health concern there, it remains largely overlooked in the United States. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cme/chagas/lesson_1/7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; estimates that around 300,000 people living in the United States are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. Many were born in endemic regions of Mexico, Central America, and South America, yet most don’t know they are infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the popular idea that this disease only affects immigrants or travelers is dangerously outdated. My research confirms that T. cruzi is actively circulating in U.S. wildlife, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12233274/?utm_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; have found infected kissing bugs and mammalian hosts in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7470559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7470559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/13/4/06-1002_article?utm_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, and now the &lt;a href="https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-medical-entomology/volume-62/issue-3/tjaf018/Trypanosoma-cruzi-Kinetoplastida-Trypanosomatidae-in-the-Midwest--prevalence-among/10.1093/jme/tjaf018.short?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;While Trypanosoma cruzi in raccoons and triatomine bugs doesn’t guarantee human infection, the ecological conditions for spillover already exist, and in some cases, transmission has likely occurred. A recent review in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/14/7/901" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; found about 90 confirmed or suspected locally acquired Chagas cases in the U.S. between 2000 and 2020, mostly in Texas but also in Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, and California. More recently, a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0012920" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;field study&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, revealed that nearly 35% of triatomine bugs collected inside homes tested positive for T. cruzi, and 23% had fed on humans, confirming direct human-vector contact and ongoing potential for unnoticed transmission. A 2022 study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35731040/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; about 10,000 locally acquired cases in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although locally acquired Chagas cases remain relatively rare in the United States, some researchers are beginning to raise concerns that could shift this dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://nwdistrict.ifas.ufl.edu/phag/2021/10/01/chagas-disease-a-health-risk-for-rural-people-in-the-southeastern-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;University of Florida Extension report&lt;/a&gt; states that the risk of human contact with infected triatomine bugs may increase in areas where homes border wooded landscapes or include features like dog shelters, poultry sheds, or stacked firewood. These environments create ideal hiding spots and blood sources for the insects, raising the chances they’ll enter homes. As climate change and land development reshape ecosystems, monitoring these risk factors is critical to staying ahead of potential disease spillover.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s worse is how unprepared we are. Most doctors in the U.S. don’t consider Chagas disease in their differential diagnoses. Routine testing is nearly nonexistent. There’s no standardized national surveillance, and most infections are only discovered incidentally, such as during blood donor screening. By then, it’s often too late.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even among those familiar with Chagas, there’s a misconception that it’s rare or imported. My fieldwork contradicts that narrative. If raccoons in rural Illinois are carrying this parasite in such high numbers, what does that mean for human exposure? People living in rural and wooded areas, hunters, campers, and agricultural workers are all potentially at risk, especially as triatomine bugs expand their geographic range due to climate change and environmental shifts.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The CDC has published data and guidelines on T. cruzi, but much of the clinical community remains unaware of the disease’s domestic relevance. This knowledge gap is both preventable and dangerous. Every year we delay action, we miss opportunities for early detection, treatment, and public education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be clear, Chagas disease is treatable if caught early. Antiparasitic medications like benznidazole can reduce parasite load and prevent progression, particularly in children and newly infected patients, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. But we must first recognize it exists here, and test for it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The solution is not panic but preparation. We need:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awareness campaigns to educate clinicians and the public&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Expanded diagnostic access, especially in high-risk regions&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Targeted screening for patients with unexplained cardiac issues in endemic zones&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Continued wildlife surveillance to monitor spread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My experience as a research scientist showed me that the line between neglected and recognized diseases is not biology, it’s attention. Chagas disease has all the warning signs of an emerging public health crisis: silent spread, climate-driven expansion, low awareness, and long-term health consequences. What it lacks is urgency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen this before. Covid-19, mpox, and now rising tick-borne diseases, all emerged from complex relationships between humans, wildlife, and environmental change. Trypanosoma cruzi is no different. It’s not a matter of if this becomes a bigger problem in the U.S., but how soon, and whether we will be ready. It’s time to stop underestimating Chagas disease and start treating it like the threat it truly is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Esther Onuselogu, M.Sc., is a biological sciences researcher with a focus on public health. Her thesis is on Trypanosoma cruzi infection in U.S. wildlife. She is passionate about infectious disease awareness and public health equity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The human brain tends to slow down as we age — even healthy brains shrink. That can make learning and memory harder as people age. But some people's brains shrink more slowly than their peers. This lucky group is called "SuperAgers." They're people aged 80 or older. But they have the memory abilities of someone 50-to-60 years old. This week in the journal Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia, researchers from &lt;a href="https://www.brain.northwestern.edu/superaging/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Northwestern University's SuperAging Program&lt;/a&gt; summarized some of the secrets they've learned in the last 2.5 decades.   &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to hear about more stories about human health and aging?
