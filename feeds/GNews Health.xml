The two are so closely linked, and we know what’s good for one is often good for the other. We were excited to see some of the strongest evidence to date that you can protect your brain health with exercise, healthy eating, social interaction and brain games. A new study looked at people at risk of developing dementia because of a family history or other factors, and found a “recipe” of lifestyle changes helped improve their cognitive function. About 45 percent of all dementia cases might be preventable, according to other research, so this is incredible news for anyone (everyone?) who’s worried about their memory or brain health as they age. And back to that heart-mind connection. Those very same lifestyle changes that are so good for your brain often help your heart. Cardiologist Eric Topol shared 10 science-based ways to protect your ticker — plus there’s an online tool you can use to find out how “old” your heart is! — and I’m sure our minds would benefit, too. But before that …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GBRUOROFKBGXHJ7M6XROR3MGOQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GBRUOROFKBGXHJ7M6XROR3MGOQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;This week’s must-reads:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="6VOS4GDES5ACNFDGLCSBNZVCDU" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s how to embrace the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/29/blue-spaces-calming/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;benefits of ‘blue health’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She ended up with a bat in her mouth — and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/31/rabies-vaccine-cost/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;$21,000 in medical bills&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Picking up the pace &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/27/walking-cadence-aging-health-improvement/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;on your walk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helps, even for older adults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 100-year-old on a bike?

&lt;p&gt;In general, all three experts say that avoiding ultra-processed foods and fatty meats (like sausage or bacon) at breakfast is one big way to ensure your morning meal is adding years to your life instead of subtracting them. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6538973/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916715" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Scientific research shows&lt;/a&gt; that a diet high in ultra-processed foods is directly linked to reducing lifespan. Similarly, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2803089/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916715" data-affiliate="true"&gt;eating red or processed meat regularly&lt;/a&gt; increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three experts say minimizing added sugar at breakfast is another way to add years to your life. That means avoiding sugary cereals, flavored yogurts and pastries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a longevity-supporting breakfast, focus on whole, nutrient-dense foods that provide a balance of healthy fats, proteins and complex carbohydrates. Incorporate plenty of antioxidants from fruits like berries, healthy fats from nuts, seeds, or avocados and fiber-rich vegetables or whole grains,” Sehgal advised. He also said that including probiotic-rich foods like yogurt or miso, as Bhanote’s breakfast does, can support gut health, which plays a critical role in overall well-being and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes to no surprise that plants reign supreme when it comes to the breakfasts of choice for longevity experts. Consider this a reminder to get your fill of them in the morning. While vegetables are often regulated to lunch and dinner, incorporating them into your breakfast along with an unprocessed protein source is a science-backed way to increase your lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting your morning by adding years to your life? Not too shabby of a way to start the day. Use it to set the tone and keep the longevity-supporting habits coming. With hope, you’ll be doing them for many, many years to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/healthy-breakfasts-for-long-life_l_67004049e4b0c12c1d3bd133" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916715"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptors in your nerves, so your brain perceives less pain and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But it acts on other parts of the body too - including the cardiovascular system - which can be risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;High levels can cause a rapid heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms and seizures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Although rare, there are documented deaths from excess caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some people are more sensitive to caffeine than others and can feel nauseous, anxious and irritable, and get headaches even at lower doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Generally, up to 400mg of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/news-alerts/news/fsa-and-fss-issue-guidance-on-caffeine-in-food-supplements" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;caffeine a day &lt;/a&gt;appears to be safe for most healthy adults - that's around four cups of instant coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Tea contains a bit less, so five cups a day is usually fine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pregnant women are advised to halve daily intake to 200mg or less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Children and teenagers are also more susceptible to the risks and potential for an overdose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is why energy drinks containing over 150mg of caffeine, for example, are already required by EU law to carry labels stating: "High caffeine content.

Either way, the disease hijacks the instructions that tell our cells how to behave, turning helpful teammates into troublemakers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, oncology has focused on destroying those unruly cells. A new line of work asks a different question: what if we could push them back to their earlier, well-behaved selves instead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift in thinking matters because collateral damage from chemotherapy and radiation can leave patients exhausted, immunocompromised, or facing secondary health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-cells-create-power-waves-to-fuel-invasion/"&gt;malignant cells&lt;/a&gt; into harmless ones – rather than wiping them out – could soften side effects and open doors for people too frail for aggressive regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spotting-the-tipping-point"&gt;Spotting the tipping point&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before a tumor shows up on a scan, genetic and epigenetic tweaks accumulate inside would-be cancer cells. Eventually the balance tips, launching a rapid change known as a critical transition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicists know a similar tipping point from the way water flashes into steam at 212 °F (100 °C). Biologists, though, have struggled to pin down that instant in living tissue because every cell moves at its own pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (&lt;a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;KAIST&lt;/a&gt;) recently reported a method that captures this fleeting window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team at KAIST, led by Professor Kwang-Hyun Cho of the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, calls its approach REVERT, short for REVERse Transition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to record each cell’s gene activity, reconstruct the internal circuitry, then simulate how the circuitry shifts as cancer sets in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-revert-kills-cancer-with-math"&gt;REVERT kills cancer with math&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many computational &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/computer-model-can-identify-tumor-fighting-immune-cells/"&gt;cancer models&lt;/a&gt; rely on differential equations packed with hard-to-measure parameters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REVERT keeps the math lean by translating gene networks into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/boolean-logic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Boolean logic&lt;/a&gt;: every gene is either on or off, yes or no. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That stripped-down map is surprisingly powerful. It lets the software explore all the stable states – called attractors – that a cell might occupy and rate each one with a malignancy score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low score reflects orderly growth signals. A high score flags a pattern more typical of tumors, such as constant division or resistance to suicide signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By nudging one switch at a time in the computer, the investigators can ask which combinations shove a high score back down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pausing-a-rogue-gene-pair"&gt;Pausing a rogue gene pair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medicinal-plant-has-great-potential-to-fight-colorectal-cancer/"&gt;Colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; gave REVERT its first real-world test. The researchers fed the program single-cell RNA-sequencing data from patient biopsies, watched the simulated cells cross the transition, and searched for breakpoints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One culprit popped up quickly: &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MYC&lt;/a&gt;, a gene famous for stepping on the gas in many cancers. Shutting off MYC alone, however, did not restore order. The malignancy score fell partway, then stalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second gene, &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=YY1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;YY1&lt;/a&gt;, changed the picture. Treating MYC and YY1 as a toggle switch produced two stable outcomes. Tip the balance one way and the cell speeds toward malignancy; tip it the other and normal behavior resurfaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have discovered a molecular switch that can revert the fate of cancer cells back to a normal state by capturing the moment of critical transition right before normal cells are changed into an irreversible cancerous state,” said Cho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-code-to-colon-organoids"&gt;From code to colon organoids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding candidate switches &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; is useful, but genuine tissues decide whether a therapy will fly. The researchers collaborated with &lt;a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Seoul National University&lt;/a&gt;, which provided colon organoids grown from patient samples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scientists reduced activity of USP7 – another REVERT-highlighted target – the organoids regained orderly architecture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells once eager to overgrow instead respected their neighbors’ space and lined up neatly. Those test-tube results hint that similar reversions could emerge in living patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In particular, this study has revealed in detail, at the genetic network level, what changes occur within cells behind the process of cancer development, which has been considered a mystery until now,” Cho explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that uncovering those hidden levers marks the first time anyone has shown that “an important clue that can revert the fate of tumorigenesis is hidden at this very critical moment of change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-using-revert-on-different-cancer-types"&gt;Using REVERT on different cancer types&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal tumors were the proving ground, yet the underlying logic of critical transitions spans many cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lung and breast malignancies, for example, also pass through mixed-identity stages where healthy and diseased programs overlap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because REVERT focuses on that limbo period rather than late-stage chaos, it may reveal intervention points earlier than traditional drug screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-cell_transcriptomics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Single-cell transcriptomics&lt;/a&gt; keeps improving in depth and speed, so feeding richer datasets into the Boolean engine should sharpen its predictions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/crispr-used-to-remove-extra-chromosomes-in-down-syndrome-and-restore-cell-function/"&gt;CRISPR-based&lt;/a&gt; gene editing has grown precise enough to toggle multiple switches in living tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pair those tools and oncologists could one day customize reversion cocktails for each patient, sparing healthy organs the collateral hits of broad-spectrum treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cancer-revert-and-regenerative-meds"&gt;Cancer, REVERT, and regenerative meds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attractor landscape at the heart of REVERT does more than illuminate cancer. Stem-cell biologists routinely coax cells to choose fates during laboratory reprogramming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Errant transitions, however, can derail tissue-engineering projects. A map that catches switches before the wrong fork could refine protocols for growing heart muscle, insulin-producing pancreas cells, or even neurons for spinal-cord repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the new framework remains a laboratory concept. Clinical trials that target paired switches must prove safe and durable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tumors also mutate quickly, potentially rewiring the very circuits researchers aim to reset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, a strategy that persuades misbehaving cells to stand down – rather than carpet-bombing them – offers a fresh playbook in the long fight against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202412503" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 23:38:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOeWN5TThxY05xaUJMbDR3VlZIblIwSmpwLVBwWEprRkRpRXoyNGhiS216VURYX0NId1NEcjRqaXhXR0xLSmNjS1l5eVAwbkFYMHJqdlZoTmJTS1Jha2NGYmVEeGJHSXl1UDZITnI2a0dSWWZTX0tNWFJGUmdodmlRc0daMF9EZGg5T2M2MjNCalBzMXRPVEo3M3M3MTJENXZXN3g3V3M1ZEZOaG1RcnpULTNvYnZyZw</guid></item><item><title>诅咒的印记？坏死性溃疡代替男性的交叉纹身。- Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPSng3TV9SNFI1aTBxZVJ6ZklRUEpIc2ZIc0dJbkRNWTR4eDJJVHJZNzU5UEVxYWxWaUZSUlBPU0l0UVBranRQdkcyWjdPZnpIWFBVcUYtSW14M2ZGTHRPLXIwaWFmUTBRU0lGRnlLelVyRHNWLU5hVTZxc0Z4cHRQLUZkWTJLVFlPYzJZdzhuSEx3YXJ5TDRDYnJadmtVVjV6NXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;

But all they got out was dead tissue debris and immune cells, which wasn't very helpful. Given the masses, blood clots, and spreading necrotic ulcer, the man was sent to surgery. The doctors surgically removed the ulcer and masses and closed off the clotted veins. They then had to use tissue from the man's thigh to reconstruct his neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jinxed ink&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final diagnosis was necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis, which means that clumps of immune cells formed amid inflammation, his lymph nodes became inflamed and swollen, and there was also dead tissue. It's unclear exactly how it all happened, but the doctors had several hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central theory is that he had an abnormal immune response to the tattoo—red organic dyes and heavy metals that can be found in some tattoo ink have been linked to this before. In one possible scenario, the abnormal immune response led to immune cell clumping, causing his lymph nodes to swell and press against his vasculature. This in turn slowed blood flow in his neck, causing cells to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that chronic inflammation from the tattoo caused the walls of his veins to start eroding, also leading to cell death. A biopsy showed necrosis in his jugular veins that supports this hypothesis. It's also possible that the inflammation response involved a variety of aberrant immune responses that spurred a hyper-coagulant state, meaning his blood formed clots more easily. Blood clots in his neck could have also led to a necrotic lesion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doctors can't say for sure what happened—or if it involved some sort of divine retribution—they say the case expands the possibilities of bad outcomes from tattoos and clinicians should be aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the man recovered from the ordeal after comprehensive support. He was likely advised to avoid tattoos—and possibly holy water.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prescriptions for weight loss drugs, including Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro, have &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12979695/ozempic-usage-american-states-weight-loss-drug-rates.html"&gt;surged more than 700 percent&lt;/a&gt; in the US among those who do not have diabetes, and who are prescribed the drug off label, from 21,000 prescriptions in 2019 to about 174,000 in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, 1.9million Americans have been prescribed a weight loss drug since 2018, according to data analysis company Truveta, and more than 9.3million prescriptions for the medications have been issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While patients lose several pounds on the injections every month, the weight loss happens so rapidly that they are often left with loose skin as a result of the loss of fat and muscle volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those in their 20s and 30s, plastic surgeons said their skin should still be able to bounce back, while sunken cheeks and hollow eyes should recover, but for older adults, they can be left with loose hanging skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To combat the loss, people turn to injectable substances used to restore volume, smooth wrinkles and enhance facial features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They typically last for around three months and cost around $500 to $1,200 per syringe. Fillers are minimally invasive and can be inserted during a single appointment, with patients able to return to normal life the same day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Adam Rubinstein, a plastic surgeon in Florida, added to this website: 'This has been a trend for a little while, and it is not so much some sort of side effect of Ozempic or Mounjaro or drugs like them, it is really just a normal consequence of weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But, because so many people have had weight loss made easier by these medications, a lot more people are losing weight, losing weight everywhere and then seeking these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even after you lose 10 or 15lbs, you notice facial changes. Sometimes the amount of weight you lose can show up in your face.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), which tracks cosmetic and surgical procedures in the US, found that filler injections have more than doubled between 2017, when Ozempic was first approved, and 2024, the latest date available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic was originally approved for type 2 diabetics, but it has been prescribed off-label by doctors to those who are looking to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its sister medication Wegovy, which uses the same active ingredient semaglutide, was approved in June 2021 for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were around 6.2million filler injections carried out in the latest year, they found, compared to just 2.6million when the weight loss drugs were first approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bruno and Dr Rubinstein, a plastic surgeon in Florida, said that the 'bulk' of this increase was down to the surge in the use of weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they also said that over this period society has become more accepting of fillers and more people have been open about receiving injections, further raising demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ASPS data also showed there had been a 32 percent surge in abdominoplasties, or tummy tucks, over the same period, from 129,000 to 170,000 annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scott Disick shocked the public when he emerged looking gaunt and malnourished in March last year, with images later emerging of weight loss drugs in his refrigerator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Above is a woman who lost 135lbs after using a GLP-1 medication.

              &lt;p&gt;A common sedative sometimes taken to get high is becoming deadlier. Research out this week finds that annual U.S. deaths caused by nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas or whippits, have significantly spiked over the past decade and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Mississippi and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign conducted the study, an analysis of mortality data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They found that yearly reported nitrous oxide deaths rose by roughly 500% between 2010 and 2023. Though the death toll from this drug is still low overall, the study indicates that recreational nitrous oxide use is becoming a bigger problem, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The “findings underscore a growing public health concern and the need for enhanced surveillance and prevention efforts,” they wrote in the paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2836925"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in JAMA Network Open.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/nitrous-oxide-laughing-gas"&gt;Nitrous oxide gas&lt;/a&gt; is routinely used in medicine as a sedative and anesthetic (perhaps most notably at the dentist’s office). And it’s a common propellant with many uses, including in whipped cream. People also use it recreationally to induce euphoric, if short-lasting, effects. These users often get nitrous oxide from whipped cream canisters, giving rise to the drug’s common nickname of “whippets” or “whippits.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other studies have &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10550887.2020.1813361"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that nitrous oxide misuse in the U.S. has increased over time, but according to the authors, there’s still little we know about the deaths that this misuse is causing. Though the effects of nitrous oxide are typically short-lasting, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/nitrous-oxide-laughing-gas#:~:text=Some%20people%20use%20nitrous%20oxide%20recreationally%20to%20achieve%20a%20momentary%20euphoric%20high.%20But%20inhaling%20laughing%20gas%20more%20often%20than%20you%20need%20it%20can%20cause%20serious%20and%20potentially%20life%2Dthreatening%20health%20complications%20like%3A"&gt;misuse&lt;/a&gt; can lead to oxygen deprivation, low blood pressure, seizures, and even heart attacks. Chronic use also saps the body of vitamin B-12, which can cause paralysis and permanent neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers examined death certificate data sent to the CDC. In 2010, they uncovered 23 reported deaths associated with nitrous oxide poisoning among people between the ages of 15 and 74. By 2023, there were 156 such deaths—a fivefold jump. Annual nitrous oxide deaths continued to increase significantly until 2018 and have since plateaued.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the latest &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt47095/National%20Report/National%20Report/2023-nsduh-annual-national.pdf"&gt;National Survey on Drug Use and Health&lt;/a&gt;, at least 13 million Americans have used nitrous oxide recreationally in their lifetime. But the growing popularity of consumer nitrous oxide products has likely driven a surge in recreational use, the researchers say. These products are commonly sold online or in stores as whipped cream chargers or similar culinary products with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/style/galaxy-gas-nitrous-oxide.html"&gt;colorful names&lt;/a&gt; like “Galaxy Gas.” People on social media outlets like TikTok have encouraged the use of these products as part of viral challenges, though TikTok and other platforms have recently taken action to stop these challenges from spreading (at least some teens may still be finding &lt;a href="https://baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2024/09/28/galaxy-gas--nitrous-oxide--tiktok"&gt;workarounds&lt;/a&gt; to see the posts, though).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study researchers say that more should be done to educate Americans, especially children, about the dangers of the drug when misused and to mitigate its harm however possible.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This is not local to one area; it’s everywhere,” said study researcher Andrew Yockey, University of Mississippi assistant professor of public health, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-07-nitrous-oxide-deaths-spike.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “And it absolutely deserves national surveillance. The numbers are still small right now, but they’re growing, and they’re growing fast.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has also spotted an increase in reported adverse events related to nitrous oxide. In March 2025, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda-advises-consumers-not-inhale-nitrous-oxide-products"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a warning to the public to stop using these products recreationally, which it updated in June with more brands to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/video/embed/vi3271083033/"&gt;Sharks with frickin' lasers&lt;/a&gt; are tired news. Peacocks, apparently, are where it's truly at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Famous for their dazzling iridescence, peacock feathers are known to &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2018.0043"&gt;contain nanostructures&lt;/a&gt; that scatter light in ways that make their plumage shimmer in hues of blue and green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying a special dye to multiple areas on a peacock's tail, researchers from Florida Polytechnic University and Youngstown State University in the US went on the hunt for structures that may emit a very different signature glow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a mind-blowing first for the animal kingdom, they discovered the eyespots on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/female-animals-teach-each-other-to-choose-unusual-males-research-suggests"&gt;the fowl's fabulous feathers&lt;/a&gt; have unique properties that align light waves by bouncing them back and forth, effectively turning them into yellow-green lasers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-emits-a-secret-light-that-scientists-are-trying-to-read?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Your Brain Emits a Secret Light That Scientists Are Trying to Read&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word laser itself is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Shine a light on atoms in certain materials, such as certain dyes or crystals, and they'll collectively excite one another into releasing a flood of photons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of light amplification &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1566119918303963?via%3Dihub"&gt;isn't rare&lt;/a&gt; in nature, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06736"&gt;attracting the attention&lt;/a&gt; of researchers who are interested in developing biological lasers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To become a bona fide laser beam, however, the buildup of stimulated waves must be neatly aligned so their phases march in step. One way to achieve this is to reflect the waves back and forth in a confined space known as an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_cavity"&gt;optical cavity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_103608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-103608" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/lasercoherency_explainer.jpg" alt="laser coherency diagram" class="wp-image-103608 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/lasercoherency_explainer.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/lasercoherency_explainer-553x415.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/lasercoherency_explainer-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-103608" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;What makes a laser's light so different? (ScienceAlert)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found evidence of optical cavities in the form of resonating nanostructures in different parts of the eyespot, all faintly emitting two different wavelengths: green and yellow/orange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly what kind of structure is responsible for aligning the amplified light at these colors isn't clear. But the fact they are found across the feather, all emitting the same precise wavelengths in a signature fashion, is a sign that something strange is at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying the physical properties of these resonators could lead to advances in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-laser-breakthrough-can-read-text-on-a-page-from-a-mile-away"&gt;laser technology&lt;/a&gt;, or provide biologists with a new tool for analyzing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/living-material-made-from-blood-can-repair-bones-study-shows"&gt;living materials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the peacocks, we can only guess why evolution built lasers into their stunningly iridescent plumage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given how biologists are quickly coming to terms with the way &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-shaved-roadkill-to-find-out-how-mammals-glow-in-the-dark"&gt;animals fluoresce&lt;/a&gt; and shine in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/most-birds-of-paradise-are-secretly-biofluorescent-study-finds"&gt;patterns and colors&lt;/a&gt; beyond our perception, it may be for displays that other peacocks are well adapted to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blue-sharks-may-be-secret-chameleons-scientists-discover"&gt;sharks with lasers&lt;/a&gt; aren't such a terrible idea after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-04039-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It was the same table where I’d sat through both of my pregnancies and where, three years earlier, I’d been diagnosed with breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m so sorry,” my doctor said. “I know how it feels to go through menopause. Especially since you went through it overnight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was the one who diagnosed me with cancer. I’d found a small lump on my right breast and called her office immediately. Our appointment fell on Halloween 2017, and she was dressed up as Snow White, wearing full face paint and a black wig. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You are one of the lucky ones,” she said, as I sat on the table and cried. “You don’t need chemotherapy, and you’re going to be okay.” My doctor was right — I was lucky. I’d caught it early, and with breast cancer, early detection is everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My treatment consisted of a mastectomy, reconstruction surgery and 10 years of targeted hormone therapy — to kill the estrogen in my body and lower my risk of recurrent cancer. The goal of these hormone treatments — for pre-menopausal women — is to slingshot you through menopause. It worked. Within a matter of weeks, I went from being a healthy 37-year-old menstruating woman, to a hot-flashing, bone-aching, post-menopausal cancer survivor. I suffered vaginal irritation, something I’d later learn was vaginal atrophy. The only thing not atrophying were my post-operative breasts — they looked perkier than ever. But while my boobs felt 16 again, my vagina felt 61. It was a total mindfuck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It hurts,” I complained. “Just... all the time. And especially during sex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Menopause makes it very uncomfortable — nearly impossible — to have successful intercourse,” she said matter-of-factly. “Have you heard of vaginal rejuvenation? A colleague of mine, in Albuquerque, is offering laser treatment in her practice. I think you’d be a great candidate for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author taking a selfie during her first mammogram appointment. "I didn't know at that time what was ahead of me," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;An hour later I was home, googling laser vaginal rejuvenation. Eventually, I found a reputable women’s healthcare site with information on the treatment. Above the medical description, there was a photo of a smiling woman in her 60s, wearing a pink button up shirt. She had done the treatments and seemed to be enjoying “successful intercourse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of vaginal rejuvenation treatment I was considering, “gently rejuvenates” the vagina, by delivering a type of therapy known as fractional CO2 (carbon dioxide) laser energy to the soft tissues of the vaginal wall and providing a hormone-free treatment for vaginal atrophy. Vaginal atrophy — for those who have not yet journeyed into the Saharan desert of menopause — is next-level vaginal dryness. It’s a side effect of menopause — practically a guarantee. For many women and people with vaginas, vaginal estrogen creams can provide sufficient relief for the pain experienced during intercourse caused by vaginal atrophy. For women like me — who are proactively killing the estrogen inside their bodies with mega medications — the research remains ongoing about estrogen creams, rings and tablets, and whether they are safe to use. Right now, it’s not something I am comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was excited to discuss what I’d learned with my husband. In the throes of parenting two toddlers — while also recovering from a life-threatening illness — addressing sexual dysfunction was on our to-do list but hadn’t yet become a crisis in our marriage. Together we defined two major drawbacks to the treatment. The first was the price tag. The laser treatment consists of three sessions, distanced a few months apart. I was quoted $3,000 in total for the three sessions. Insurance does not cover the cost of vaginal rejuvenation, although you might be able to get reimbursed through a flexible spending account (FSA). I don’t have one of those. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second concern was the risk. Most of the websites I researched did not mention any risk involved with the treatment. But there is, of course, risk when you decide to have your vagina lasered. Some women have experienced excruciating pain during the treatment and — in very rare cases — suffered vaginal burns. Despite all that and because I was one of the lucky ones to have access to the treatment and could afford it, I decided to try it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband, Alex, at the Inn in Vermont where they got married. "This was on our 8th wedding anniversary," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, I was taking in the desert mesas on my way to Albuquerque for my first laser treatment. When I arrived at the small gynecology practice, I was greeted by a young and chipper receptionist. I told her in a quiet voice that I was there for vaginal rejuvenation. She asked me to repeat myself. I did. She giggled nervously and asked me to wait. I watched her consult with a co-worker before returning to the window. “I’m sorry,” she said with amusement. “I hadn’t heard of that before.” I shot her a look that was meant to say, &lt;em&gt;menopause is coming for you too, young lady. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I was led to an examining room and given a gown. A nurse entered the room and applied a numbing cream to my labia. As I waited to go numb, I spotted the laser treatment in the corner of the room. It was a tall machine with a long, slender wand. It looked like something you might see at a dentist’s office. Then the gynecologist walked in — an older, soft-spoken, hippy-ish woman — and told me how excited she was to have the opportunity to perform the treatment. “Have you used the laser before?” I asked nervously. “Only a few times,” she responded. I tried to ignore the sudden wave of panic that washed over me. She turned on the machine and it made a loud, vibrating noise. As I laid back, a tagline from an old Virginia Slims commercial popped into my mind: &lt;em&gt;You’ve come a long way, baby. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial treatment went well. For a few days, I experienced some light vaginal bleeding, which was to be expected. The laser creates tiny micro-abrasions on the vaginal wall, increasing blood flow and stimulating the growth of new blood vessels — essentially bringing new life to your vagina. I didn’t feel any pain during the treatment, although it was a bit uncomfortable and awkward. After the first session, I noticed something right away. My vagina seemed happier. In fact, it didn’t hurt ― at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My gynecologist told me to have sex in-between the sessions, to help maintain my new elasticity. I was feeling so bolstered from the positive results of the first treatment, I couldn’t wait to jump into bed with my husband. But when it came time to get down to business, I was extremely disappointed to find out penetration remained very painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry,” I said to my husband, after we tried — unsuccessfully — to have sex. “I can’t do this, it hurts too much.” I was in tears. We both were frustrated. &lt;em&gt;Would I ever have sex again?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author, her husband and two children on Halloween 2017, a few hours after her doctor diagnosed her with breast cancer. "We are trick-or-treating on Canyon Road in Santa Fe, New Mexico," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I brought this question to my next appointment in Albuquerque. My gynecologist told me to wait to finish all three treatments before coming to any conclusions. But the results from the second treatment weren’t all that noteworthy. And the same was true for the third and final treatment. It seemed to me the major benefits of vaginal rejuvenation occurred after the first treatment. It had a very positive effect on the overall wellbeing of my vagina but didn’t fix the painful symptoms I was experiencing during intercourse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Six months after my initial doctor’s visit, I was back in the examining room detailing my experience. My doctor and I agreed that researching and devoting more funds to women’s health has a long way to go. Most women can’t afford expensive vaginal laser treatments, and instead, are learning to normalize their pain or simply avoid talking about it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Did vaginal rejuvenation fix the painful symptoms I experienced during sex? No. Do I feel comfortable using an estrogen cream? Again, no. But I think of the waiting room at the Dana Farber Cancer Center — and I guess I can live with it. The question is, why should I? Why is there a little blue pill for erections and not an effective medication for vaginal dryness? Yet again, it seems we have been given the shaft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before I left, my doctor wrote me a prescription for Lidocaine, a numbing cream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Put this on twenty minutes before sex, it really helps,” she said. Before she left the room she turned and gave me a half smile, as if to say, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;welcome to menopause, we’ve come a long way, baby. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;But have we? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a few other non-estrogen vaginal atrophy treatments out there — and maybe someday I’ll try them. For now, my partner and I are exploring what “successful intercourse” means to us. Penetration is only one way of having sex — there are lots of fun things to do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It surrounds your organs, messes with your metabolism, and quietly raises your risk for things like heart disease, diabetes, and more. It’s called visceral fat, and the kicker is, you don’t have to look overweight to have too much of it. Spot reduction is not really an option, but certaian tweaks in the routine can help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, even slim folks can carry dangerous levels of visceral fat — a condition sometimes referred to as “skinny fat.” Unlike the soft layer just under your skin (subcutaneous fat), this kind hides out around your liver, kidneys, intestines, and heart, fueling inflammation and silently working against your health. Visceral fat increases the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and even Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 workouts to cut down that belly fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to tell if you’ve got too much visceral fat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If visceral fat is about 10% of your body’s total fat mass, that’s normal and healthy, according to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24147-visceral-fat" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/living-with/healthy-weight.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Generally, if your waist measures more than 35 inches for women or 40 inches for men, it may be time to take notice. But don’t cheat the tape, breathe out naturally and wrap it just above your hip bones, right around your belly button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hint is your muscle-to-fat ratio. If you’ve lost muscle and gained fat, especially as you age, that imbalance can mean more visceral fat inside, even if the scale doesn’t budge much. Tools like DEXA scans or smart body composition scales can offer more insight, but the everyday clues, low energy, weight gain around your midsection, or poor sleep, are often just as telling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chris Chappel, on his social media page, recently shared nine habits that can naturally shrink visceral fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoid late-night eating&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating close to bedtime isn’t just about calories, it affects hormones like insulin, cortisol, and glucose, which all play a role in fat storage. Try shifting your biggest meals to earlier in the day and giving your body a few hours of fasting before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Embrace the cold&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold exposure, like a quick 1–2 minute cold shower or using an ice pack a few times a week, can activate brown fat, which burns energy to produce heat. It’s not a miracle fix, but it can help reduce waistline over time when done consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Move more &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about your workouts. Daily movement that isn’t “exercise”, like walking while on the phone, cleaning the house, or taking the stairs, actually burns a surprising amount of fat. It’s called NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis), and it adds up fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Apple cider vinegar before meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a tablespoon of diluted apple cider vinegar about 10 minutes before meals has been shown to reduce post-meal blood sugar spikes. Stable blood sugar means less fat storage, particularly around the belly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prioritize sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep isn’t just rest, it’s a reset button for your hormones. Getting less than 6 hours a night over time is linked to significant increases in visceral fat. Aim for 7 to 9 hours, cut screen time before bed, and sleep in a cool, dark room. Right sleep environment is crucial for a good night's sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Add more soluble fiber&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soluble fiber helps regulate blood sugar, supports gut health, and improves insulin sensitivity, all of which play a part in reducing belly fat. Some good sources: avocados, oats, flaxseeds, and Brussels sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rethink your cooking oils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly processed oils like canola, soybean, and corn oil can fuel inflammation, which plays a big role in fat gain. Instead, reach for olive oil, avocado oil, or even grass-fed butter in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lift weights &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training just two or three times a week can lower visceral fat, even if your weight doesn’t drop. Building muscle improves insulin sensitivity, which helps your body manage fat storage more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start your day with protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping protein in the morning is a missed opportunity. A breakfast with 30–40 grams of protein helps reduce hunger later in the day and keeps blood sugar levels steady. Try eggs, Greek yogurt, a protein shake, or lean meats like turkey sausage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With consistent effort and mindful habits, shrinking visceral fat is not only possible — it’s one of the best investments you can make in your long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

Eight have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection, called Vibrio vulnificus, is one of a dozen species of Vibrio: a bacteria found in coastal waters when the weather is warm and in raw shellfish, especially oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Department of Health said Thursday morning that it is seeing a higher number of cases and deaths than typically reported. So far this year, there have been 17 cases and four deaths in the state. Seventy-five percent reported seawater exposure as the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;This is a noticeable spike compared to previous years. Between 2013 and 2023, there was an average of &lt;a href="https://lsbme.la.gov/severe-vibrio-vulnificus-infections-in-the-united-states-associated-with-warming-coastal-waters" target="_blank"&gt;13 cases per year&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen cases and four deaths have been reported to the Florida Department of Health. The state has been a hot spot for Vibrio vulnificus infections in prior years. In 2022, 74 people were infected and 17 died — "an abnormal increase in cases," the department said at the time. Many were linked to Hurricane Ian, which brought bacteria-laden floodwater into homes.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Both Mississippi and Alabama have had only one recorded case. Neither were deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that 1 in 5 people who become infected die, while many survivors undergo limb amputations. Symptoms include diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting, fever and chills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with open wounds should be cautious when swimming in brackish or warm coastal waters. Some Vibrio vulnificus infections lead to necrotizing fasciitis — a severe bacterial infection that kills the flesh around an open wound, which is why it is called a "flesh-eating" bacteria, health officials said. People with weakened immune systems should also be careful when eating or handling raw seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;After spending months without eating, drinking, or moving, hibernating mammals must rebound from extreme physiological changes. Two new studies suggest that the genetic “superpowers” underlying this incredible resilience may also be present in the human genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For these studies, published Thursday, July 31, in the &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4701?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D51090245318916360690338922894760961130%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1753966582"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4025?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D51090245318916360690338922894760961130%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1753966595"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at the University of Utah honed in on the specific DNA regions that help hibernators rapidly recover from muscle atrophy, insulin resistance, and brain damage. They found strong evidence to suggest that the human genome shares these genetic regions, which function as control switches for hibernator adaptations. Finding and harnessing them could lead to new treatments for type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and other disorders, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Humans already have the genetic framework,” said Susan Steinwand, a neurobiology and anatomy researcher at U of U Health and first author of one of the studies. “We just need to identify the control switches for these hibernator traits.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;During hibernation, mammals enter a state of torpor, or physiological dormancy. This allows them to survive months without food and water, but at great cost to their health. Their muscles deteriorate due to lack of nutrition and movement, Christopher Gregg, a professor of neurobiology at U of U and senior author on both studies, told Gizmodo. Proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease build up in their brains, and upon awakening, the sudden reperfusion of blood can cause further neurological damage, he explained. What’s more, they become insulin resistant due to the amount of fat they gain to sustain them during months of starvation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hibernating mammals have evolved remarkable adaptations to reverse this extensive physiological damage. The genes that underlie these adaptations are likely also present in humans and other non-hibernators, Gregg explained. The fact that hibernation has evolved independently in multiple animal species suggests that its basic genetic ingredients are present across the mammalian genome. Therefore, non-hibernators may still carry them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We mostly all have the same genes across species,” Gregg said. “The big change is in the 98% of the genome that does not encode for genes.” Non-coding DNA is largely responsible for gene regulation. In hibernators, specific regions of non-coding DNA act as “master switches” for controlling functional gene responses to starvation and refeeding, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Finding these master switches in the mammalian genome is like searching for needles in a DNA haystack. To accomplish this, the researchers made whole-genome comparisons across mammals to identify conserved DNA regions that are stable in most species but show accelerated change in hibernators. These hibernator-accelerated regions are regulators that turn genes on in specific cells at specific times, Elliott Ferris, a data analyst in Gregg’s lab at U of U and first author of one of the studies, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To understand the biological processes that may be linked to these hibernator-accelerated regions, the researchers identified genes that get turned up or turned down during fasting in mice. Hibernation is an adaptation to survive food scarcity, so fasting triggers similar metabolic changes. This led them to “hub genes” that act as master regulators for fasting-induced changes to gene activity.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The really surprising discovery that was very exciting was that the hibernation-linked elements are disproportionately affecting those key hub genes,” Gregg explained. “The implication is that hibernators changed the regulation and activity of these core hub genes to have big downstream effects on the whole program for responding to food scarcity and food deprivation. That’s important as we think about translating this knowledge into the real world.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gregg is co-founder of Primordial AI, a Utah-based biotech startup that leverages AI to uncover master regulator gene drug targets. Through this company, he aims to develop drugs that mimic the genetic advantages hibernators have, such as boosting neuroprotection in Alzheimer’s patients or reversing insulin resistance in type 2 diabetics. “Those hub genes are the ones that we think are a really good starting point to design medicines to affect those genes,” Gregg said.&lt;/p&gt;

However, one family physician sees patients who are often surprised that their weight increased—or at least their efforts to lose it stalled—after they also upped their &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/number-one-healthiest-fruit-according-to-registered-dietitians" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fruit intake;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fruit intake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Fruit can satisfy that sweet tooth, hopefully helping you avoid the less healthy refined sugar," says &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/dr-mike-sevilla-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mike Sevilla, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Mike Sevilla, MD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;a family physician. "On the other hand, I have a lot of patients who have incorporated fruit in their diets, but are not achieving weight loss."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's frustrating to follow advice and not see results. However, Dr. Sevilla often asks questions about &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;his patients consume fruit. Their answers frequently reveal they're making a common but sneaky mistake with it. The good news? Fixing it isn't complicated and can be downright delicious. Dr. Sevilla and other doctors share the one thing they're begging people attempting to lose weight to stop doing with fruit, why and what to do instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🩺 &lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/a&gt; 💊&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The No. 1 Fruit Mistake To Avoid When You're Trying To Lose Weight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After talking to patients struggling to lose weight, Dr. Sevilla learns that some of them are using fruit juices. "I prefer my patients to use whole fruit for health benefits," he says. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2813987" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; by Harvard researchers suggested that a tall glass of 100% fruit juice daily could contribute to &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/habits-of-people-who-never-gain-weight-according-to-experts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight gain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet, seeing "100% fruit juice" on a container in the grocery store can seem promising and healthy. Speaking of which, when you look at the front of a fruit juice label, you may see phrases like "Excellent source of &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1142998/shameikarhymes/vitamin-c-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;." That's not just clever marketing—it's true. Doctors aren't denying that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Some of the benefits of fruit, such as vitamins, can still be there in juice form," says&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mir Ali, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Mir Ali, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it's important to read the &lt;em&gt;entire &lt;/em&gt;nutrition label for fruit juice to see what else is in it (and what's not) that could stifle weight loss efforts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/weekly-walking-workout-plan-for-weight-loss-according-to-trainers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Personal Trainers Share Exactly What a Week of Walking Should Look Like if You Want To Lose Weight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Personal Trainers Share Exactly What a Week of Walking Should Look Like if You Want To Lose Weight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Fruit juices are low in fiber, which does not satisfy hunger, and can cause people to drink more juice and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/worst-habit-for-blood-sugar" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spike their blood sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;spike their blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and insulin levels," explains Dr. Sevilla. "In addition, the amount of calories in fruit juices is higher and more concentrated than in whole fruit."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These risks also apply to recipes one weight loss doctor often sees incorporated into "juice cleanses," which, ironically, can have the opposite effect on your goals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"'Juicing' juice cleanses can hinder weight loss because they have too much sugar and not enough fiber to slow absorption of fruit sugar," explains &lt;a href="https://www.drdecotiis.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sue Decotiis, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Sue Decotiis, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a medical weight loss doctor in New York City.

They may gravitate toward juices with added sugar (and not fiber) instead. Additionally, it's essential to be mindful of whole fruit intake when trying to lose weight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doctors share these tips to help you eat foods that nourish your body and support your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;1. Learn to enjoy whole fruit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Patients constantly ask Dr. Sevilla how to make whole fruit more enjoyable. For instance, there are numerous ways to enjoy fruit without making it the star of the plate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Add fruit to some of your favorite dishes, which helps add a welcoming sweet taste to your meal," he recommends. "[One] example is to toss diced apples or pears into a salad with walnuts and feta. At breakfast, you can try mixing berries into cottage cheese or low-sugar Greek yogurt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;2. Balance nutrients regardless of your fruit's form&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Sevilla's meal suggestions are balanced—for instance, cottage cheese and Greek yogurt have protein, and apples are a good source of fiber. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Decotiis says that's important. In fact, she advises people trying to lose weight to be mindful of how much fruit they consume—even in whole form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Fruit contains important vitamins, minerals and fibers, but also fructose, which is a form of sugar," she points out. "While eating fruit is healthier than eating sucrose found in sweets, it is still sugar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Therefore, a balance of nutrients is key, with fiber and protein playing vital roles. Without fiber? It doesn't matter if the fruit was in whole or juice form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Sugar will be absorbed quickly, resulting in a spike in insulin," Dr. Decotiis notes. "We could see a rapid drop in blood sugar or glucose that could trigger hunger and cravings between meals. Eating fruit with protein or having the fruit with a meal can help avoid swings in blood sugar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;3. Load up on vegetables&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Vegetables have less sugar, much more fiber on average and many—if not more—nutrients," Dr. Decotiis explains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1316162/michelle-polizzi/high-fiber-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fiber is filling;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Fiber is filling&lt;/a&gt;, helps control hunger and boosts gut health while also keeping you regular (pooping)—all of which can help you lose weight at a healthy pace. So, you may not need to load up on fruit if you're consuming lots of vegetables daily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If vegetables are consumed in adequate amounts, only one fruit a day is really necessary," she says. "Fruits with higher fiber grams are apples [and] &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-happens-if-you-eat-avocados-every-day" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avocado;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;avocado&lt;/a&gt;—yes, it’s a fruit, not a veggie."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Ali also notes that consuming fruits on the lower end of the glycemic index can help lower the odds of experiencing blood sugar fluctuations that can make weight loss more challenging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Fruits like berries and citrus fruits have a lower glycemic index and tend to cause less sugar spikes," he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-happens-if-you-eat-bananas-every-day" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Here's What Happens to Your Body if You Eat Bananas Every Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Related: Here's What Happens to Your Body if You Eat Bananas Every Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Consumption of 100% Fruit Juice and Body Weight in Children and Adults. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2813987" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Pediatrics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mir Ali, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Mir Ali, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-not-to-do-with-fruit-when-trying-to-lose-weight-according-to-doctors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Doctors Are Begging People Trying To Lose Weight To Stop Doing This One Thing With Fruit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Doctors Are Begging People Trying To Lose Weight To Stop Doing This One Thing With Fruit&lt;/a&gt;

experts say this year is the worst tick &lt;/a&gt;season on record due to a milder winter across the US, which allowed more ticks and their animal hosts to survive the winter months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A Maine resident has been hospitalized with the year's first human case of the tick-borne Powassan virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Powassan virus human disease cases reported by area of residence from 2004 to 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In line with other tick-borne diseases, human cases of Powassan virus have steadily risen over the past decade in the US, a trend some say is linked to &lt;a href="/news/climate_change_global_warming/index.html" id="mol-6f08b9b0-da13-11ed-b0f8-8f0644773167" target="_self" class=""&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; and clearing more land for development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections are increasing across the midwest and northeast and are most common in the summer months when ticks are active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the Powassan virus case in Maine, the CDC is warning residents and visitors to the state to take care in areas ticks might be present to prevent themselves from getting bit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powassan virus is named for the city it was discovered in, Powassan, Ontario, where it was discovered in a young boy in 1958.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person will often feel symptoms of the virus somewhere between a week and a month after the tick bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Along with other tick-borne disease, human cases of Powassan virus have steadily increasing over the past decade in the US, a trend some say is linked to climate change and clearing more land for development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initial symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting, and generalized weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease can then spread to the brain and cause inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it reaches this stage some of the more severe symptoms include an altered mental status, seizures, speech problems (aphasia, dysarthria), paralysis, and movement disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Maine resident was reported to have suffered severe neurological symptoms as a result of their infection. They are currently receiving treatment for their infection in a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC reports that a majority of people that are infected with the virus are asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government agency has reported 397 cases of the virus since 2004 and 50 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, cases have been steadily increasing year over year, with the highest number of patients in 2024 at 57.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of the Powassan virus are extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Maine, less than 20 have been reported over the last 12 years, though the prevalence of asymptomatic infections means the figure is likely an undercount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, the most common tick-borne disease is Lyme disease with more than 470,000 new cases but only a small fraction of these cases result in death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Lyme disease is the most prevalent, there are at least 20 other tick-borne diseases in the US, including anaplasmosis, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ticks aren't the only threat, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile virus and dengue fever are also becoming more prevalent due to the rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;West Nile virus is currently the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the US. Just this week, mosquito samples from two cities in Ohio tested positive for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far this year, there have been 98 human cases of West Nile virus in the US, including 53 severe or 'neuroinvasive' cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the US declared dengue outbreaks in 2024 that have continued into 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local transmission of dengue was reported last year in California, Florida, and Texas. Florida has reported local dengue transmission in 2025 with four confirmed cases of 'locally acquired' dengue found in Brevard County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far in 2025, there have been 2,553 cases of dengue fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They're called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW2eGaUzq7E" target="_blank"&gt;Demodex&lt;/a&gt;, and they feast on the greasy oil (sebum) in your pores! These microscopic 8-legged arachnids are related to ticks and spiders. They don't have an anus or eyes. It's more than likely that you have dozens of them on you at this very minute. They spend most of their time near your hair follicles. They "crawl out to the surface and mate, before crawling back into your pores to lay their eggs." It's impossible to truly rid your body of all of them, so don't waste your time trying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The term first popped up in 2020, and has since taken off on social media, with thousands of users sharing what they “order” when they feel low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s helpful to think of a dopamine menu like a regular menu, Adrienne Matei explained, with “starters” that take little time and effort, more substantial “mains”, and “sides” that zest up the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Matei spoke to several happiness experts about the items on their dopamine menus. These included giving people compliments, sitting in your favorite green space, cuddling with a loved one, and smashing objects to bits in a rage room. Whatever works for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/18/whats-on-your-dopamine-menu-15-ideas-for-a-positivity-boost" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;&lt;sub class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More about dopamine menus&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;h2 id="let-them" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Let them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This year, millions of people realized they can’t control the actions of others – no matter how desperately they might want to. At the end of 2024, podcaster and self-help guru Mel Robbins published a book called The Let Them Theory. Its central thesis was simple: if someone is doing something that bothers you, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/29/let-them-mel-robbins-self-help-mantra" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;let them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The book made a splash. It jumped to the top of bestseller lists. There were news articles and podcast episodes about the theory, and Oprah called it a “gamechanger”. People even got “Let them” tattoos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The theory was not without critics. Some claimed Robbins cribbed the idea from poet Cassie B Phillips, whose poem, Let Them, went viral in 2022. Others said the concept was obvious. But sometimes obvious advice is the most helpful. As one therapist said: “It’s a reminder that it’s OK to step back, let people be who they are, and stop carrying things that aren’t ours to carry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/29/let-them-mel-robbins-self-help-mantra" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;&lt;sub class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More about the ‘let them’ theory&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;h2 id="creatine" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure id="ad3f4457-7fc7-44a8-a4ee-c4a5503dfb82" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Creatine is a naturally occurring compound that helps power short bursts of high-impact activities.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Gabriel Soler Tomasella/Alamy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Strength training has been the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/09/weightlifting-tips-beginner-strength-training#:~:text=Start%20without%20weights,%2C%20pushups%2C%20lunges%20and%20planks." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;darling&lt;/a&gt; of the fitness world recently (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jul/25/older-women-weightlifting" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;deservedly&lt;/a&gt; so), and as more people spend time moving heavy weights, there is an increasing demand for products and supplements that help maximize each lift. Enter &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/15/what-is-creatine-benefits-drawbacks" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;creatine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Long a favorite supplement among athletes and fitness professionals, creatine is a naturally occurring compound that helps power short bursts of high-impact activities – think sprints or heavy lifts. Synthetic creatine is often sold as a white, flavorless powder that one can mix with water or juice (some influencers take it dry as a stunt, but experts strongly discourage this as it could lead to choking).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Creatine is considered safe for most healthy adults. And while research doesn’t fully support popular social media claims that creatine helps build muscle, it might do so indirectly by giving you more energy during intense workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/15/what-is-creatine-benefits-drawbacks" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;&lt;sub class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More about creatine&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(Is that the most cursed sentence I’ve ever typed? Who’s to say.) Online, many speculated that her youthful appearance was the result of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jun/27/what-is-a-deep-plane-facelift" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a deep plane facelift&lt;/a&gt; – a technique that works with deeper layers of tissue than a traditional facelift. Searches for the term soared. (Jenner did not discuss or confirm any particular procedures.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Deep plane facelifts are pricey, because it is a more complex procedure, and also tends to last a few more years. They can set patients back anywhere from $30,000 to $100,000. By contrast, the average cost of a regular facelift in the US is about $11,395.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jun/27/what-is-a-deep-plane-facelift" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;&lt;sub class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More about deep plane facelifts&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;h2 id="psyllium-husk" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psyllium husk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure id="4c2f177a-c4d2-4f4c-8f8a-93f25ae0e429" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Psyllium husk has been touted by influencers as “nature’s Ozempic” – a cheap, non-prescription alternative to GLP-1 medications.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Boommaval Boommaval/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jun/11/what-is-psyllium-husk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Psyllium husk&lt;/a&gt; has been touted by influencers as “nature’s Ozempic” – a cheap, non-prescription alternative to GLP-1 medications. But this comparison is “oversimplified and misleading”, warns Lena Beal, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Psyllium husk comes from the seed of a desert shrub, and is the leading ingredient in popular laxatives like Metamucil. When consumed with water, it’s simply a good source of soluble fiber, and has been found to help lower levels of “bad” cholesterol, slow down digestion and increase satiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If psyllium husk isn’t your thing (some people don’t enjoy the gloopy, gel-like texture it develops in water) don’t fear. There are plenty of other good sources of fiber, like fruits, vegetables and legumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jun/11/what-is-psyllium-husk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;&lt;sub class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More about psyllium husk&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;h2 id="fibermaxxing" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fibermaxxing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As protein mania reaches a fever pitch, consumers are already looking toward the next nutrition trend. According to some on social media, the future is all about “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/09/fibremaxxing-could-tiktoks-latest-wellness-trend-actually-make-sense" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fibermaxxing&lt;/a&gt;” – a trendy term for “eating a lot of fiber”. As one wellness influencer put it, fiber is “super cool”. Indeed, one study found a fiber-rich diet can improve heart health and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. You could give psyllium husk a try – or just eat an apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/09/fibremaxxing-could-tiktoks-latest-wellness-trend-actually-make-sense" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;&lt;sub class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More about fibermaxxing&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="aa62e5da-f409-47aa-97fa-f4ed9545bc69" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.EmbedBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="UnsafeEmbedBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"html":"&amp;lt;script src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js\"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;","alt":"inline button","index":37,"isTracking":false,"isMainMedia":false,"source":"The Guardian","sourceDomain":"uploads.guim.co.uk"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPelYzM3p2UnJGa01iT2ttbE9wNDdJc2hidnlZcEQxeXhWOFcxYkJYbWNSUE5RVnN0VW5RdTBXSGJFVFJMTU1mVC00Ullac2FVX2JaX0xidHIxUXFib181Q01hQ2FHRVJhaFpEb3ZMdDMxUmJFc1hmZXlaNGFOOG5WTnI2aEJrcWxJOGk2ZFpRaXVDTHItMkZCcF9n</guid></item><item><title>大麻使用者面临明显更高的口腔癌风险，类似于吸烟者- Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOaGV3ZzMtc0pSczFYMld2d2kwa1dockxuQjRlTW5nTXQ4SGlJeGhhekliWktTY2lJVkJVQklOV214b0NaeGFTQ0pEbF9Rc3BfcXBaeV9aeHRfV01SWnU3azc0TjkyVjVHUEFoQnM0dktrVDMxeXFxR1ZXZ0pUOGsyc3dvbldDbl9vRkFvRzFYNHg1d2VuZ3RIZXZMOHFtaklaYmw2eHJkeVI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More people in the United States now smoke cannabis every day than drink alcohol, with about 17.7 million daily or near daily users recorded in the 2022 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38775461/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Survey on Drug Use and Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift adds urgency to questions about what long term, high frequency use might be doing to the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of California San Diego (&lt;a href="https://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSD&lt;/a&gt;) followed more than 45,000 patients. They found that people diagnosed with cannabis use disorder (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538131/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CUD&lt;/a&gt;) were 3.25 times more likely to develop oral cancer within five years than those without the disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elevated &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-use-in-any-form-directly-linked-to-significant-risk-of-heart-damage/"&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt; held even after accounting for age, sex, body mass index, and tobacco smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/raphael.cuomo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Raphael E. Cuomo, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and member of the &lt;a href="https://moorescancercenter.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Moores Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt;, led the analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points out that the findings dovetail with toxicology data showing cannabis smoke carries many of the same chemicals blamed for tobacco related malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-use-linked-to-oral-cancer"&gt;Cannabis use linked to oral cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legalization has widened access to cannabis, yet roughly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16854249/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;three-in-ten&lt;/a&gt; regular users meet criteria for the disorder, a clinical diagnosis that signals problematic use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike casual &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/legal-access-to-cannabis-is-proving-to-be-good-for-both-people-and-society/"&gt;consumption&lt;/a&gt;, CUD typically involves near daily smoking, deeper inhalation, and higher potency products that bathe oral tissues in combustion by products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; estimates about 59,660 Americans will be told they have cancers of the mouth or throat in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking remains a leading risk factor, but human papillomavirus (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt;), heavy drinking, and now cannabis may add new layers to that risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral tumors often begin as painless spots on the lip or tongue, making early detection tricky. By linking CUD and tumor incidence in electronic health records, the &lt;a href="https://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC San Diego&lt;/a&gt; team offers clinicians a fresh flag for vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-raises-cancer-risk"&gt;Cannabis raises cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study drew data from six academic medical centers between 2012 and 2019, then tracked each participant for five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 2.1 percent developed CUD, yet that small group accounted for nearly a third of the oral cancer diagnoses observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/smoking-related-deaths-will-surge-by-2030/"&gt;Tobacco smokers&lt;/a&gt; in the cohort already faced extra danger, but those who both smoked cigarettes and had CUD were six times more likely to be diagnosed than smokers without CUD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the cannabis signal persisted inside the smoking subgroup, Cuomo’s team suspects mechanisms beyond simple smoke exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted that women, older age, and higher body mass index appeared to slightly temper risk, echoing patterns seen with tobacco related oral cancers. However, those demographic buffers did not erase the impact of CUD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smoke-harms-mouth-tissue"&gt;Smoke harms mouth tissue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18062674/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analyses&lt;/a&gt; show that marijuana smoke contains hundreds of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-03/documents/pahs_factsheet_cdc_2013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PAHs&lt;/a&gt;), benzene, and ammonia, many at concentrations equal to or higher than tobacco sidestream smoke. Several of these compounds directly damage DNA in epithelial cells lining the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A detailed chemical fingerprint published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63120-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; cataloged 2,575 distinct compounds in mainstream cannabis smoke, 110 of which are known human toxicants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such particle rich aerosols stick to mucosal surfaces, extending contact time between carcinogens and target cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Histology from habitual marijuana smokers has revealed &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9719080/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dysplasia&lt;/a&gt; and other precancerous changes in bronchial tissue even when tobacco is absent. Those cellular alterations mirror the earliest steps seen on the path to malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-affects-cancer-defense"&gt;Cannabis affects cancer defense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tetrahydrocannabinol (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/tetrahydrocannabinol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt;), the main psychoactive molecule in cannabis, can impair &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18040791/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune suppression&lt;/a&gt; pathways that normally patrol for rogue cells. Less immune surveillance could give mutated oral cells a head start toward tumor formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edible or vaporized products bypass the oral cavity, yet frequent users often combine delivery methods, so risk patterns for noncombustible forms remain unclear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies that separate smoke exposure from total THC dose may untangle these variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another unknown is whether the rising average potency of commercial &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-potency-why-you-shouldnt-trust-the-label/"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; accelerates carcinogen uptake or immune effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public laboratories have only begun to simulate how today’s 25 percent THC flower compares with the 4 percent material studied decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daily-users-face-big-risk"&gt;Daily users face big risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with CUD commonly face co-occurring mental health challenges, alcohol misuse, and lower participation in preventive dental care. These overlapping factors could compound cancer risk and delay diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socioeconomic gaps may also play a role, because uninsured adults are less likely to receive routine oral examinations. Community clinics that integrate substance use counseling with oral screenings could bridge that divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clinicians, the takeaway is straightforward. When a patient meets criteria for CUD, adding a quick inspection of the mouth and a referral to dentistry costs little but may spot trouble early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heavy-cannabis-harms-oral-health"&gt;Heavy cannabis harms oral health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis is not just a milder cousin of tobacco, its smoke delivers a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-extract-cbd-proven-highly-effective-at-killing-mosquitoes/"&gt;complex chemical load&lt;/a&gt; with measurable impacts on human tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UC San Diego study reminds us that heavy, prolonged use carries consequences that legalization debates often overlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy makers weighing retail expansion should ensure that cancer prevention messaging keeps pace with marketing. Clear warnings, similar to those on cigarette packs, could help users make informed choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, anyone lighting up daily can lower potential harm by switching to noncombustible products, spacing out sessions, and keeping regular dental check ups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will continue probing dose, delivery, and biology, but prudence starts with individual habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis smoke contains many of the same carcinogenic compounds found in tobacco smoke, which have known damaging effects on the epithelial tissue that lines the mouth,” noted Cuomo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying aware of that simple fact may be the first step toward safer choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335525002244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preventive Medicine Report&lt;/em&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-0b46afe3-5373-4d7b-b149-ae51b4185ee8"&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-94c7e0c5-6e44-4b60-b48d-91c9796c24f4"&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-443f8909-7106-405a-b093-e9b4bd7024ee"&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-4454416d-6e1a-4eaf-b811-4a941bc234b2"&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 16:14:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOaGV3ZzMtc0pSczFYMld2d2kwa1dockxuQjRlTW5nTXQ4SGlJeGhhekliWktTY2lJVkJVQklOV214b0NaeGFTQ0pEbF9Rc3BfcXBaeV9aeHRfV01SWnU3azc0TjkyVjVHUEFoQnM0dktrVDMxeXFxR1ZXZ0pUOGsyc3dvbldDbl9vRkFvRzFYNHg1d2VuZ3RIZXZMOHFtaklaYmw2eHJkeVI</guid></item><item><title>致命的食肉细菌在路易斯安那州杀死4人- WAFB</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQcHVJNWQxaEpWV3N4M19pZDNKRV9RUU9LTUpyNHM0bWN2V01yZUY2b2MwWEhhM0pMQ2dReWV6aU5NanZGVzJpbFl1eHFtUmctUWtSYXJRZHFZZ2dEOFk0NUJ1TktRQ2pPLUUzUERhXzhnVk4xc0ozZXM3anl3YVlmajYydjRCQdIBmgFBVV95cUxPcmxxVWRZREc2ZjFSdHZwWHNPeG5kS1NSRHI3NWFrQVhVc3VxSFVwT3NRSWQ4UXZJWHQxWUZmUFFWUGpTWHVYOW9VbWtxYnlLMkZITE5rYkhhbUd5azAwSnA4UERXbllxYVUyZWY5a1ROQm1xUFZNem1vamZMX3pSRDBDdW1ORDJLUUtlaUcyNGlIbl92Y3Ryci1R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - Louisiana health officials are warning residents to take precautions after a rise in cases of Vibrio vulnificus, a potentially deadly, flesh-eating bacteria found in warm coastal waters and raw seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;So far in 2025, the Louisiana Department of Health has confirmed 17 Vibrio vulnificus infections statewide. All required hospitalization, and four people have died. Over the past decade, the state reportedly averaged only seven cases and one death annually during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The bacteria can cause illness when an open wound is exposed to coastal waters or when a person eats raw or undercooked seafood, particularly oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The LDH says 75% of this year’s infections have been linked to open wounds exposed to seawater. Vibrio bacteria thrive in warmer months, typically May through October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In Florida, thirteen people have contracted Vibrio vulnificus and four have died from it so far in 2025, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html"&gt;Florida Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;State health officials warned that you don’t have to be swimming to be at risk. Even handling raw seafood with a small cut can cause a severe infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who’s most at risk?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;While anyone can become infected, individuals with chronic health conditions such as liver disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV, or those who are immunocompromised, face a much higher risk of severe illness or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Some infections result in gastrointestinal symptoms like watery diarrhea, cramps, nausea, fever, and chills. Others cause wound or bloodstream infections that may lead to blistering skin lesions, amputation or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;According to the CDC, about 1 in 5 people with Vibrio vulnificus die, sometimes within 48 hours of becoming ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to stay safe:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list | article-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoid brackish or saltwater with open wounds or cover wounds with waterproof bandages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thoroughly clean any cuts that may have been exposed to water or raw seafood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wear protective gloves when handling raw shellfish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Don’t eat raw or undercooked oysters or seafood, especially if you’re in a high-risk group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wash your hands with soap after handling raw seafood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Additional resources and prevention tips are available on the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html"&gt;CDC’s Vibrio page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divider | border-bottom mx-auto w-75 my-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:typo@wafb.com" target="_self" rel="" title="mailto:typo@wafb.com"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Click here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to report a typo.

&lt;p&gt;Caffeine may help some bacteria keep antibiotics out of their cells, potentially reducing the therapeutic effects of the drugs, a new laboratory study hints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts caution that it's not yet clear how this effect might play out in humans, so caffeine drinkers needn't panic yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have known for decades that bacteria can &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1429469790730861249&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41579-018-0048-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fmedicine-drugs%2Fcaffeine-may-help-e-coli-resist-antibiotics-but-more-research-is-needed" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-018-0048-6" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41579-018-0048-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fmedicine-drugs%2Fcaffeine-may-help-e-coli-resist-antibiotics-but-more-research-is-needed" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;protect themselves&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by pumping out harmful substances through special transport proteins in their outer layers — and this ability helps bacteria resist the effects of drugs that would otherwise kill them. However, it wasn't clear how bacteria change the activity of the genes behind these transport proteins in response to molecules they encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more, researchers tested how the common gut bacterium &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; — better known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64436-e-coli.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64436-e-coli.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— responded to 94 different chemical compounds, including antibiotics and aspirin, as well as products made in the gut, like secondary bile acids. They also looked at small molecules found in common foods, such as vanillin, the compound that gives vanilla its flavor, and caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study, published July 22 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003260" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003260" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showed that many different chemicals can trigger changes in bacterial transport-related genes and thus potentially affect their response to antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/superbugs-are-on-the-rise-how-can-we-prevent-antibiotics-from-becoming-obsolete" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/superbugs-are-on-the-rise-how-can-we-prevent-antibiotics-from-becoming-obsolete"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superbugs are on the rise. How can we prevent antibiotics from becoming obsolete?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, caffeine was found to reduce the production of a transport protein called OmpF, which helps bring common antibiotics — like ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin — into bacterial cells' membranes or innards. In theory, with fewer of these OmpF proteins available, the antibiotics cannot access their targets within the cells as easily, making them less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-aFfbWSfR43o3DjbHEFjdXk" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-aFfbWSfR43o3DjbHEFjdXk slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this finding shouldn't worry coffee drinkers just yet — there are many potential variables that haven't been studied yet, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ecehh.org/person/april-hayes/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ecehh.org/person/april-hayes/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;April Hayes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Exeter who was not involved in the study. "This would include whether the effect of caffeine would reduce the body's ability to clear infections," Hayes told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/a.edwards" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/a.edwards" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Andrew Edwards&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of molecular microbiology at Imperial College London, agreed that "there's no evidence from this study that drinking coffee will affect a person's response to antibiotics and nobody should change their routine." Edwards, who was not involved in the study, said he recommends that people prescribed antibiotics follow their doctor's guidance and the instructions that come with the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="adaptable-microbes-3"&gt;Adaptable microbes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany looked at how seven genes involved in transport inside &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; responded to different chemicals. Out of the 94 substances they tested, 28 changed the activity of these genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chemicals that had an effect included caffeine; the weed killer paraquat; and certain classes of antibiotics, like tetracyclines and macrolides. Drugs that block folic acid, which are used to treat some cancers and inflammatory diseases, and salicylates, a broad class of drugs that includes aspirin, also had an effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study adds to a growing appreciation that bacteria can sense and respond to numerous different stimuli … all of which can affect the susceptibility of the microbe to antibiotics," Edwards said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-third of the chemical-induced genetic changes involved the Right-origin-binding protein ("Rob," for short), which switches genes on or off by binding to specific DNA sequences. The findings suggest that Rob plays a bigger role in helping &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; adapt to its environment than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, though, it's still unclear exactly how caffeine changes gene activity in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; or interacts with Rob at the molecular level. Additionally, the researchers don't yet know whether the effects seen in lab experiments happen the same way during real infections in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers found that caffeine's ability to interfere with how antibiotics work also applied to a strain of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; sampled from a real patient with a urinary tract infection. This lab experiment suggests the effect of caffeine on bacteria could have important implications for human health — but again, that will need to be confirmed in future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could also look at microbes beyond &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. The researchers suspect their findings may also have implications for how other bacteria tweak their transporters over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But importantly, "at this point, it still seems highly unlikely that consuming caffeine would result in a difficult-to-treat infection," Hayes said. "Overall, this study is interesting, but is not a cause for concern for caffeine consumers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-aFfbWSfR43o3DjbHEFjdXk-8g6TlsOeaIzsfPf6gMeYd2hDsoIzIdTD" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-aFfbWSfR43o3DjbHEFjdXk-8g6TlsOeaIzsfPf6gMeYd2hDsoIzIdTD slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical or dietary advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;How’s the weather inside your head? If it’s foggy, you are not alone. You may have what people with a variety of health conditions call brain fog — a common term for thinking problems that can make getting through the day a mental slog.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;While there’s no official list of symptoms, people with brain fog often say that “their thinking is not clear, it’s cloudy,” says Lynne Shinto, a naturopathic doctor and professor of neurology at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University. “They might say, ‘I have problems concentrating.… I feel like I don’t have clarity of thought, and sometimes I forget things.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/what-is-dementia/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="dementia"&gt;people with dementia&lt;/a&gt; or other, more severe cognitive challenges, they often can do what they need to do in a day, but “their thought processes are just slower,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Cognitive psychologist Julie Dumas, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Vermont, says brain fog can be like “thinking through mud or molasses.”&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Brain fog is not a disease or disorder itself, so it’s important to figure out the underlying cause, Dumas says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;A recent research review published in &lt;i&gt;Trends in Neurosciences&lt;/i&gt; found that brain fog has been linked with more than a &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/most-common-chronic-health-conditions/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="chronic health conditions"&gt;dozen chronic conditions&lt;/a&gt;, and exact symptoms and cognitive test results can vary, depending on the apparent cause. That suggests that there’s no one underlying pathway, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the most common possible causes of brain fog:&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Sleep problems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Not getting &lt;a href="/health/healthy-living/better-sleep-for-better-health/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="better sleep"&gt;enough sleep&lt;/a&gt; is a major cause of brain fog. If you have chronic insomnia, which can include problems falling or staying asleep, improving your sleep can clear the fog, says Leslie Swanson, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at Michigan Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;Another sleep disorder strongly tied to daytime sleepiness and foggy thinking is &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/sleep-apnea-treatment-benefits/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="sleep apnea"&gt;obstructive sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;, a disorder in which people stop breathing repeatedly during sleep. Many people go undiagnosed and untreated for this condition, Swanson says. “&lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/causes-of-snoring/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="snoring"&gt;Snoring is a red alert&lt;/a&gt;” and a good reason to see a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Perimenopause&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;Women going through the hormonal shifts of perimenopause, the years before periods end, often report brain fog, with problems like forgetting names or having &lt;a href="/work/careers/talking-to-boss-about-menopause/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="menopause and work"&gt;trouble focusing at work&lt;/a&gt;, Swanson says. Studies back them up, she says, finding “small declines” in learning and verbal memory.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;Part of the explanation is that perimenopause often comes with sleep disturbances, especially unwanted awakenings during the night, Swanson says. &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/common-menopause-symptoms-treatments/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="menopause symptoms"&gt;Hot flashes&lt;/a&gt; cause some, but not all, of those disturbances, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Hormonal shifts may affect sleep and brain functioning even in women who don’t have a lot of hot flashes, she says. The good news, she says, is that the fog tends to lift after menopause.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. COVID-19 and other infections&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;When you get &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/covid-flu-or-cold-symptoms/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="flu covid or rsv"&gt;the flu, COVID-19 or any infection&lt;/a&gt;, especially with a fever, you can get brain fog, which is likely linked to inflammation, Dumas says. But one reason more people are hearing about brain fog these days is that it’s a common part of &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/long-covid-symptoms/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/health-conditions-that-cause-brain-fog.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="long covid"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, the symptoms that continue or develop after the initial illness, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Shinto says she has seen some long COVID patients with “intense brain fog, where they have a lot of trouble concentrating [and] intense mental tasks are very draining.”&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;In addition, many are constantly physically exhausted. That combination, along with other symptoms, can be disabling, making it impossible for some people to manage their usual daily activities, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;

The water soluble vitamin, explains Samantha Dieras, RN, DCN, director of ambulatory nutrition services at Mount Sinai Hospital, plays a vital role in nerve function, blood cell formation, metabolism, DNA production, and many other functions that our bodies need to stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; foods are easy to add to any routine. Whether you're solely following a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/delciously-ella-mills-healthy-plant-based-eating-guide-farmers-market-recipes-ingredients" target="_blank"&gt;plant-based diet&lt;/a&gt; or welcome any animal and dairy product into your meals, you can find vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; foods pretty much in any food group. And as an added bonus, these foods also come with other essential nutrients (think omega-3 fatty acids, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/protein-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, iron, and more) that our bodies need. So if you’re looking to see if you’re already on the right track or wanting to add more good sources of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; into your life, the best ones to add are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Clams&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you love shellfish, registered dietitian nutritionist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/laurenlovesnutrition/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/laurenlovesnutrition/"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/laurenlovesnutrition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lauren Manaker&lt;/a&gt; says that clams make for a great source of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 3 oz. of clams contain about &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;17 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient. It also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889157509000234" target="_blank"&gt;contains iron&lt;/a&gt;, which she says makes it a great combo with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; for energy and red blood cell production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beef, Chicken, and Other Animal Liver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manaker calls liver a nutrient powerhouse as it contains B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, iron, and &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/retinol-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;. According to the NIH, one serving of beef or chicken liver contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;70.7 micrograms (mcg)&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, which is almost &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;3000% daily value&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Salmon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmon is a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/victoria-beckham-eats-this-collagen-stimulating-food-every-day" target="_blank"&gt;favorite food&lt;/a&gt; amongst experts and our favorite celebs. Manaker says it’s not only high in vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; with &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;2.6 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient, but it is also a main source of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/omega-3-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;. This combo especially helps support brain function and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manaker lists trout as another fish source that is rich in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and omega-3s. According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), one filet of trout has &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/172004/nutrients" target="_blank"&gt;4.6 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tuna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuna is known as a great source of protein, but Manaker says you can also look to the fish for your B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; needs. The NIH says that 3 ounces of tuna contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;2.5 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another great source of protein and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, Manaker says eggs are &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/2-eggs-for-breakfast-for-2-weeks" target="_blank"&gt;one of the easiest foods&lt;/a&gt; to add to any meals. The NIH says one large egg contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;0.5 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dairy Milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole milk (please don’t drink raw milk), is a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/healthiest-milk" target="_blank"&gt;nutrient powerhouse&lt;/a&gt;. It’s most known as a great source of calcium to build and maintain strong bones and teeth. But it also provides protein, vitamin D, and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; to hydrate, repair muscle, and boost our energy and metabolism. The NIH says that one cup of 2% milk contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;1.3 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yogurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another dairy product you can turn to for vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is yogurt. The NIH says that 6 oz. of plain, fat-free yogurt contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;1 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sardines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinned fish are &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/are-tinned-fish-healthy" target="_blank"&gt;having a moment,&lt;/a&gt; and sardines especially make for a great source of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. “Tiny but mighty, they’re rich in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, calcium, and omega-3s,” says Manaker. According to the USDA, one tin of sardines contains &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/175139/nutrients" target="_blank"&gt;8.22 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lean Beef&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lean beef provides you with many different nutrients, such as protein and iron. Manaker also lists it as a good source of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; to give you energy and boost red blood cell health. The NIH says that 3 oz. of lean beef contains &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;2.4 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nutritional Yeast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known for its cheese-like flavor, nutritional yeast is a vegan seasoning that is packed with nutrients. It’s especially rich in vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, according to the NIH. A quarter of a cup can contain anywhere from &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;8.3 to 24 mcg&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; do for the body?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously, the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;benefits of vitamin&lt;/a&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;12 &lt;/sub&gt; are many. Manaker says that it primarily helps convert the food you eat into energy for your body. But it also supports your nervous system, produces red blood cells, and DNA production while also reducing your risk for heart disease. And if you’re feeling the need for an emotional boost, she says the nutrient can play a role in regulating your emotions and producing serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; should I take daily?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dieras says that the recommended amount of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; one should aim for can range from 2.4 to 2.8 mcg per day. For those who are pregnant, Manaker says it’s best to stick to 2.6 mcg per day while those who are breastfeeding may increase it a bit to 2.8 mcg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should I take vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manaker says that eating whole foods in a well-balanced diet is the ideal way to get your daily vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; intake. But if you’re not getting enough from food or if you have absorption issues (a.k.a pernicious anemia), you might need to incorporate dietary supplements into your routine. she says you can turn to supplements in a pill form or as a shot if prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are there downsides to vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Dieras and Manaker say that vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is generally safe and that there are minimal downsides. “B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; supplements are generally safe because your body flushes what it doesn’t need,” Manaker says. In high doses, it may cause headaches or nausea. Dieras says it might also interact with certain medications such as gastric acid inhibitors and metformin. As with any new supplement you’re interested in taking, it’s always best to consult with a doctor to make sure it’s right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a beauty or wellness trend you're curious about?

                                &lt;p&gt;WYOMISSING, Pa. - The Animal Rescue League of Berks County (ARL) is issuing a warning to residents of the Wyomissing area after an injured cat tested positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ARL received results for a positive rabies case after an injured brown tabby and white kitten were located by a resident near Hill Avenue in Wyomissing Borough on Saturday, July 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyomissing Borough, the ARL and the Pennsylvania Department of Health are assessing the exposure to all individuals involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a precaution, residents should be alert for other animals in the area with signs of illness and should not allow their pets outside unsupervised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone that suspects they have been in contact with an animal infected with rabies is advised to seek immediate medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect that an animal is infected with rabies, please contact the animal control provider of your municipality or your local police department and do not approach the animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms of rabies in animals include general sickness, swallowing problems, excessive drool or saliva, an animal who bites at everything, an animal who appears tamer than you would expect, an animal who is having trouble moving or may be paralyzed, or a bat that is on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, rabies is a neurological virus that infects the central nervous system of mammals, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death in 99.9% of human cases if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say making sure pets are up to date on their rabies vaccinations and keeping them away from unfamiliar animals, especially wildlife, is the most effective way to keep pets safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A potential new male contraceptive drug has just undergone its first tests in human volunteers. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-01004-4"&gt;The results&lt;/a&gt; give the first indication that the drug, which does not use artificial hormones or affect testosterone production by the testes, may be safe in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous attempts have been made to develop a male contraceptive in the past, these largely failed to pass  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="169652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; due to their unacceptable side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this newest contraceptive works differently from past attempts, which means it doesn't require surgery and is much less likely to cause hormonal side effects – problems that have helped stop previous attempts from reaching the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed the drug was well tolerated in a small group of healthy young men and did not appear to cause any serious side effects at the doses used. Further research will be needed to demonstrate precisely how effective it is as a contraceptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-type-of-reversible-male-contraception-proves-a-success-in-mouse-study?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;New Type of Reversible Male Contraception Proves a Success in Mouse Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new method uses a specially designed chemical &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782424005237"&gt;known as YCT-529&lt;/a&gt; to target a specific cell receptor in the testes called retinoic acid receptor–alpha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar, but less specific compounds, had been shown to reduce sperm production in humans previously. But these compounds also had unwanted side effects – such as feeling ill when &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2164/jandrol.110.010751"&gt;drinking alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, altering salt levels in the bloodstream and &lt;a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(02)00294-9/abstract"&gt;not being fully reversible&lt;/a&gt; in all men. This made them unsuitable for contraceptive use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169661" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169661" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_taking_pill_642.jpg" alt="man taking pill" class="wp-image-169661 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_taking_pill_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_taking_pill_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_taking_pill_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169661" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Previous attempts at a male contraceptive pill have proven unsuitable. (Ron Lach/Pexels/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00752-7"&gt;animal studies&lt;/a&gt;, YCT-529 was shown to produce fully reversible, temporary infertility without any significant side effects. A &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/157/4/1601/2422643?login=true"&gt;study in mice&lt;/a&gt; also found that those who went on to father babies after stopping the drug produce normal, healthy offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these results, the drug then entered into phase 1 trials in humans. This is the first stage of human testing, where a small group of healthy volunteers are recruited to test safety, tolerability, and possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This small trial involved 16 male volunteers who took the drug twice at increasing doses – either 10mg to 30mg or 90mg to 180mg. Some men took  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="169652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; pills for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were monitored for 15 days for any effects on normal hormone levels, inflammation (signs of cell damage), kidney and liver function, abnormal heart rhythms, sexual desire and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No changes were detected in the natural hormones in the body. There were also no lasting effects on liver and kidney function and no signs of cell damage. No dangerous abnormalities of heart rhythm were detected, and the participants reported no changes in mood or sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, participants only took two doses of the drug and were only followed up for 15 days. The authors say in the paper that a larger phase 2 trial is underway which will test the drug in a greater number of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will then be followed by phase 3 trials in hundreds of men where the effectiveness, reversibility and side effects of longer term use of the drug will be assessed. These are the hurdles which have prevented other approaches from being made widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why past male contraceptives have failed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present there are no commercially available contraceptive methods for men that are not only safe and effective at preventing pregnancy, but which also allow sperm production to be turned off and on again at will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While condoms have few side effects and are used at will, they have a relatively &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1363/psrh.12017"&gt;high failure rate&lt;/a&gt; (resulting in pregnancy around 12%-18% of the time with typical use).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vasectomy, which severs the tube connecting the sperm-producing testes to the rest of the male reproductive organs, is very effective (more than 99%) and safe – but it's not easily reversible and requires a minor operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169659" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/vasectomy_diagram_642.jpg" alt="vasectomy diagram" class="wp-image-169659 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/vasectomy_diagram_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/vasectomy_diagram_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/vasectomy_diagram_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169659" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diagram of a vasectomy. (Anna Bergbauer/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been previous attempts (and some ongoing) at producing a reversible method of contraception for men. Some have proven to be effective at stopping sperm production or preventing sperm from exiting the male reproductive tract. However, they haven't moved to the stage of commercial production, often because of unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of these attempts used one of two main approaches to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bacandrology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12610-020-0099-1"&gt;One method&lt;/a&gt; involves injecting a substance into the vas deferens (a tube leading from the testes to the urethra). This substance filters out and damages sperm during ejaculation. This substance can be flushed out through a minor procedure if the man wishes to become fertile again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drawback of this method is that it requires a minor surgical procedure (an injection into the scrotum) and that the man has to have a further procedure to reverse its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second route involves stopping sperm production altogether by lowering the hormones that cause sperm to be made in the testes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most successful of these trials used &lt;a href="https://srh.bmj.com/content/45/4/236"&gt;an injectable progestogen&lt;/a&gt; (a synthetic version of the sex hormone progesterone). This injectable signalled the brain to stop producing follicular-stimulating hormone (FSH) and lutenising hormone (LH), which normally &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8658012/#:%7E:text=These%20two%20hormones%20are%20composed,genitalia%20the%20maintenance%20of%20spermatogenesis"&gt;signal the testes&lt;/a&gt; to produce sperm and testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, suppressing LH also turned off the testosterone in the testes that is needed for normal, healthy function in men. To counteract the loss of testosterone, this contraceptive approach required men to take an "add back" testosterone – either as a tablet or a gel applied to the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2110729-male-contraceptive-injection-works-but-side-effects-halt-trial/"&gt;major trial&lt;/a&gt; testing this method was stopped early because of the hormonal side effects participants experienced, including mood swings, acne and changes to sex drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a long way to go before the new drug can be considered suitable for use as a male contraceptive. But this new approach shows a lot of promise because it avoids upsetting hormonal balance and can be taken orally – rather than requiring an invasive procedure. &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262083/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

They may age your body faster too. In 2023 alone, the city recorded over 140 days with temperatures surpassing 100°F. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, new research suggests that these extreme heat conditions do more than cause short-term harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; has revealed that long-term exposure to high heat can speed up biological &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/monthly-exercise-before-the-age-of-50-results-slows-brain-aging-dramatically/"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people in places like Phoenix show signs of accelerated aging at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-ages-you-like-smoking"&gt;Heat ages you like smoking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The impact is similar to the effect of smoking and drinking,” said Eunyoung Choi, lead author and gerontologist at the &lt;a href="https://usc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choi’s team compared older adults from across the U.S., including heat-struck Phoenix and cooler cities like Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living in hotter areas appeared around 14 months older biologically than their cooler-region counterparts. These results reflect how consistent heat exposure may silently wear down the body’s internal systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-affects-health-and-work"&gt;Aging affects health and work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt; gerontologist Deborah Carr noted that even small differences in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthy-aging-how-some-people-live-past-100-years/"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; matter. “It’s just a tremendous strain not only on their own lives and the lives of their families and caregivers, but also has a larger societal impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faster aging may lead to earlier onset of conditions like diabetes, dementia, and cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If those health issues appear sooner, they may push people out of the workforce or into expensive, long-term care. “It really can have tremendous impacts,” said Carr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-changes-how-your-genes-work"&gt;Heat changes how your genes work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on biological age, not just chronological &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-are-experimenting-with-new-approach-to-fight-and-stop-human-aging-necrosis/"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt;. They used DNA samples to track changes linked to a process called methylation. This chemical process affects how genes behave. It acts like switches that can turn genes on or off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methylation doesn’t alter the DNA sequence but changes how genes are expressed. These shifts can occur in response to environmental stress, poor diet, inactivity, pollution, and heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used several epigenetic clocks to measure aging. These clocks rely on different sets of DNA methylation markers and offer insight into both pace and risk of biological decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-makes-aging-speed-up"&gt;Heat makes aging speed up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased heat exposure was linked to faster aging in several clocks. Short-term exposure, such as a few days or weeks, raised PCPhenoAge, a measure tied to general physiological &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer-term exposure, such as one to six years, also accelerated PCGrimAge and DunedinPACE, which reflect mortality risk and pace of decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies support this. Heat stress can leave a lasting “epigenetic memory” that alters how immune cells and heart cells function. These changes persist long after the initial heat exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, heat has been linked with reduced methylation of genes like TLR-2. This gene affects inflammation and immunity. Such changes may explain how heat accelerates disease onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rising-heat-makes-things-worse"&gt;Rising heat makes things worse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency visits and deaths spike during heat waves. With climate change, those risks only grow. The U.S. may see 20 to 30 more extreme heat days each year by mid-century, according to the National Climate Assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choi warned that this rising heat comes as the population ages. Older people cannot cool themselves as efficiently. Medications and declining circulation increase their vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But heat affects everyone. “It’s basically like if you’re trying to tread water and someone hands you a brick,” said Robert Meade, a heat physiology expert from &lt;a href="https://www.harvard.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s just an extra weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-levels-at-home-matter"&gt;Heat levels at home matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What matters isn’t just the outdoor temperature. Conditions inside homes vary widely. Some people live in overheated trailers or apartments without cooling. Others have access to reliable air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research aims to explore these differences. Personalized data could reveal how daily exposure shapes long-term health. That could guide public health policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-long-heat-exposure-and-aging"&gt;Long heat exposure and aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that not all gene changes are harmful. Some may reflect adaptation that helps bodies handle heat better. But current evidence leans toward damage, not resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged exposure may reduce physical activity, disturb sleep, and increase stress. These effects accumulate over time, pushing bodies into faster aging even without visible symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By capturing these changes with precision tools like epigenetic clocks, scientists now offer a clearer view into how heat transforms health at its core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr0616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 13:54:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNUW5sWjRBclRZTkhCaWhrdzZIaGotOHdEbEQ4VTVyZWNsR1NVOW1WOXZvaTJjVHdjTWtrUTNNSUs5c0ZrWFFKbkNKV1RjNnNlQnpGaE80QlU2RERzTk9nQ1dlaVdDMVNqN0d5N3ZqXzFiQnRWdXVyeTB1UUM0VmZGVWVDa09iR2R2NDdrNTRjWldnNnY2ZUE</guid></item><item><title>为什么今天的年轻人患直肠癌的可能性是现在的4倍-研究发现</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxNYUN6eGdjZEhac0sxaGY1Q0RIcDVlcG5Vc3h6NFVweTVIMjFTOXdpcWpGY0JHdHJEdmlvd2VuaVJHX0lvZlNpNkRjenp0V3UwV0llTUhjeXBJNDJpLUVfUVNGQXNrN2RQcURsYmNPZkxOZUJvVVgyNGVjNnlzVHEzbkF5amE4cHlxdXJFaXBuQjg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;Cancer rates, particularly gastrointestinal cancers, continue to rise among young adults. (Photo by Frame Stock Footage on Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Americans born in 1990 face a 4× higher risk of rectal cancer (and 2× higher for colon cancer) than those born in 1950.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Early-onset GI cancers rose 14.8% between 2010 and 2019; pancreatic rates climbed 4.34% per year in 25–29-year-olds.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Obesity (BMI ≥30), Western diets, and fatty liver disease drive most of these cancers, which are sporadic, not inherited.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Younger patients often face delayed diagnoses, more aggressive treatment with marginal benefit, and greater “financial toxicity.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOSTON —&lt;/strong&gt; Americans born in 1990 have four times the risk of developing rectal cancer compared to those born in 1950, according to a sweeping analysis that reveals how dramatically cancer patterns have shifted across generations. This alarming trend extends beyond a single cancer type; gastrointestinal cancers among people under 50 have surged by nearly 15% in just one decade, transforming diseases once considered rare in young people into leading killers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;British Journal of Surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and led by researchers from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, the review examined cancer trends across multiple databases and studies. Between 2010 and 2019, cases of early-onset gastrointestinal cancers jumped by 14.8%, with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/colorectal-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; now ranking as the top cancer killer for men under 50 and second for women in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of these cancers aren’t caused by inherited genetic defects. Instead, researchers point to environmental factors tied to modern life: soaring &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/obesity-causing-cancer-young-adults-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; rates, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/colorectal-cancer-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diets dominated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/processed-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sedentary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sedentary lifestyles&lt;/a&gt;, and exposures that previous generations simply didn’t face. “The rising incidence demonstrates a birth cohort effect, implicating environmental factors, such as diet and lifestyle,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The increases hit certain groups hardest. Hispanic patients represent more than 22% of young adults diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stomach-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stomach cancer&lt;/a&gt;, compared to just 7% of older patients. Black, Hispanic, and indigenous populations face disproportionately higher rates of early-onset colorectal cancer compared to their White counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-cancer-rates-are-rising-in-young-adults"&gt;Why Cancer Rates Are Rising in Young Adults&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer incidence among Americans under 50 jumped from 5.9 cases per 100,000 people in 2000 to 8.4 cases per 100,000 by 2017. Among adults aged 25–29, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/pancreatic-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; incidence climbed by 4.34% per year beginning in the mid-1990s. Stomach cancer rates rose by 1.6% per year among women under 50 between 2010 and 2019, while &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/esophageal-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;esophageal cancer&lt;/a&gt; cases increased by 6.86% per year in 30–39-year-olds and showed a steady early-onset rise overall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These patterns mirror troubling trends worldwide, particularly in wealthy nations where Western lifestyles have taken hold. European countries reported significant increases in early-onset colorectal cancer from 2004 to 2016, with the steepest rises — 7.9%, 4.9%, and 1.6% per year — among people in their twenties, thirties, and forties, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several key factors appear to drive this health emergency. Obesity emerges as perhaps the strongest risk factor. Studies consistently show that people with a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/bmi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body mass index&lt;/a&gt; of 30 or higher face nearly double the risk of developing early-onset colorectal cancer. Diet plays an equally critical role: a Western eating pattern high in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/red-meat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt;, processed foods, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sugary-drinks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sugar-sweetened drinks&lt;/a&gt;, and refined grains, while low in fruits and vegetables, has been linked to higher cancer risk. Heavy alcohol use and smoking further compound these effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/liver-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt; represents another major factor largely absent in past generations. This condition, which affects roughly 25% of adults globally and has exploded alongside rising obesity, significantly increases gastrointestinal cancer risk even in people who aren’t severely overweight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unique-challenges-young-cancer-patients-face"&gt;Unique Challenges Young Cancer Patients Face&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond rising numbers, young adults with gastrointestinal cancers encounter challenges that older patients typically avoid. Diagnosis often comes later because neither patients nor doctors initially suspect cancer in someone so young. This delay frequently means the disease has progressed to more advanced stages by the time it’s detected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/young-adults-cancer-psychological/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Younger patients&lt;/a&gt; tend to receive more aggressive treatment than their older counterparts, even though research suggests this intensive approach doesn’t necessarily improve survival outcomes. Studies show that those under 50 are significantly more likely to receive chemotherapy and radiation, but show only marginal survival improvements compared to older patients receiving less intensive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Financial devastation often follows diagnosis. Researchers have documented that younger cancer patients experience what they term “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/financial-toxicity-in-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;financial toxicity&lt;/a&gt;” at much higher rates than older patients. This stems partly from being in peak earning years while facing massive medical bills, and partly from having young families to support during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quality of life impacts can be particularly severe for younger patients. Treatments like pelvic radiation for rectal cancer can affect fertility, sexual function, and bowel control. These concerns are especially relevant for people who may have decades of life ahead of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cancer disparities along racial and ethnic lines are stark and getting worse. Analysis of California cancer registry data showed that Black Americans had an early-onset colorectal cancer rate of 12.2 per 100,000 compared to 9.2 per 100,000 for White Americans. Five-year survival rates range from 57.6% for Black patients to 69.1% for non-Hispanic White patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-healthcare-is-responding-to-rising-cancer-rates"&gt;How Healthcare Is Responding to Rising Cancer Rates&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Healthcare systems are racing to adapt to this new reality. In 2021, the United States lowered the recommended age for colorectal cancer screening from 50 to 45, but many experts worry this reactive approach isn’t sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current treatment guidelines don’t differentiate between young and older patients, despite growing evidence that early-onset cancers may behave differently at the molecular level. Young patients often have more aggressive disease features and different genetic profiles, yet they receive essentially the same treatment protocols developed primarily based on studies of older patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some promising developments offer hope. Recent clinical trials have shown that certain intensive treatments may be safely scaled back without compromising outcomes. This is particularly important for younger patients facing decades of potential treatment-related side effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research efforts are now focusing intensively on understanding why certain birth cohorts face higher risks and identifying critical windows during childhood or adolescence when environmental exposures have the most lasting impact. Scientists are also working to develop prevention strategies and screening methods tailored specifically for younger populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, these medical advances won’t address the root causes driving this epidemic. As long as obesity rates continue climbing, diets remain dominated by processed foods, and sedentary lifestyles persist, the cancer rates documented in this review are likely to worsen rather than improve. Without dramatic changes to the environmental factors driving these increases, an entire generation faces rectal and other gastrointestinal &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer risks&lt;/a&gt; that previous generations never had to confront.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: This article summarizes a narrative review of existing studies and registry data; it does not constitute medical advice. Readers should consult healthcare professionals for personalized guidance on cancer risk and screening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study represents a narrative review rather than original research with participants. The authors systematically analyzed existing research literature, cancer databases, and registry data to examine trends in early-onset gastrointestinal cancers, defined as those diagnosed before age 50. They reviewed epidemiological data from multiple sources including the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database, various national cancer registries, and published studies from around the world. The review focused on colorectal, esophageal, stomach, and pancreatic cancers, examining patterns in incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics, genetic features, and treatment outcomes. Rather than conducting new experiments, the researchers synthesized findings from hundreds of existing studies to provide a complete overview of this emerging health issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The review documented consistent increases in early-onset gastrointestinal cancer rates globally, with the United States seeing a 14.8% increase between 2010 and 2019. The most striking finding was a birth cohort effect, where Americans born in 1990 face twice the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer compared to those born in 1950. While 10–25% of early-onset cases involve inherited genetic mutations, the majority are sporadic and linked to environmental factors including obesity, Western dietary patterns, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The increases disproportionately affect Black, Hispanic, and indigenous populations, with significant racial disparities in both incidence and survival rates. Younger patients typically present with more advanced disease stages and receive more intensive treatment than older patients, though survival outcomes vary across different studies and cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a narrative review synthesizing existing literature rather than conducting original research, this paper’s limitations stem from the quality and scope of the studies it analyzed. The authors noted that different studies use varying definitions of “early-onset” cancer, ranging from under 40 to under 60 years old, making direct comparisons challenging. Some cancer registries don’t consistently distinguish between different tumor subtypes, which can affect trend analyses. The review also acknowledged that deeper genomic characterization through whole exome or genome sequencing of large patient cohorts is needed to better understand the molecular differences between early-onset and average-onset cancers. Additionally, many of the risk factor associations come from observational studies rather than controlled trials, limiting the ability to establish definitive causal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s easy to grab when running out the door (late for something yet again), sweet enough to feel like a treat, and work well in recipes from smoothies to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a60100613/super-moist-banana-bread-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:banana bread;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;banana bread&lt;/a&gt;. So when my editor asked me to eat a banana every day for a week and document how it made me feel, I was excited to take on the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a dietitian, I know the importance of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. Fruits, including bananas, provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber our bodies need. Despite this, I will admit that there are days when I don’t quite meet my own fruit quota. So if anything, I figured taking on this challenge would help me get closer to eating enough fruit every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how my week with bananas unfolded and what I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened when I ate a banana every day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of this experiment, I reflected on how often bananas naturally made an appearance in my diet. I realized that while I wasn’t eating them daily, I did enjoy them in several forms—blended into smoothies, sliced over yogurt, or spread with peanut butter as a quick snack. I figured eating one each day wouldn’t be difficult, and I was curious to see if I’d notice any tangible benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next several days, I made a point to eat a banana a day. And honestly, it was easy to do, thanks to not needing refrigeration. Running to my car, I grabbed a banana to hang onto for when hunger pangs hit, and I was so happy I had it on hand when I got hungry. One day for dessert, I sliced a banana over &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ICELANDIC-PROVISIONS-Caramel-Banana-Creamy/dp/B0D9PC6JVW/ref=sr_1_1_f3_0o_wf?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65545332%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Icelandic Provisions salted caramel and banana skyr;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Icelandic Provisions salted caramel and banana skyr&lt;/a&gt; (tastes like banana pudding). And another day, I leaned on a classic peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwich at lunchtime (with a glass of milk, of course!). It was very little effort to add a banana to my days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the week went on, I noticed some pleasant changes. My energy levels felt steadier, especially during the busy mid-morning hours when I’d usually start searching for a quick pick-me-up. Bananas gave me a satisfying boost without the jitters or crash I sometimes get from sugary snacks. I felt more satisfied and less likely to reach for less healthy options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digestively, things seemed to move along more smoothly, too. While the difference wasn’t extreme, it was certainly positive. I didn’t feel bloated like I do on occasion, and my bowel movements were regular. Plus, having that daily banana seemed to curb my sweet tooth, so I wasn’t tempted by mid-afternoon sweets as much. Overall, it was a simple change that left me feeling good!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of eating bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas might seem basic, but they’re nutritional powerhouses. Here are some of the scientifically backed benefits of eating bananas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contains potassium&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium is a critical nutrient that &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supports heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;supports heart health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and helps maintain proper blood pressure. One medium banana provides about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1105314/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:375 milligrams of potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;375 milligrams of potassium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making it a great way to meet your daily needs of about 2,600–3,400 milligrams. If you struggle with muscle cramps after workouts or occasional fatigue, adequate potassium intake might help ease those symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aids digestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas are an excellent source of dietary fiber, with one medium banana providing about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1105314/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:3 grams of fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 grams of fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Fiber plays a significant role in supporting regular bowel movements and promoting healthy gut bacteria. What’s more, slightly underripe bananas offer a unique benefit: They’re a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11167165/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:source of prebiotic fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;source of prebiotic fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Prebiotic fiber feeds the “good” bacteria in your gut, which supports a healthy digestive system and can improve overall gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good source of vitamin B6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One medium banana contains about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1105314/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:0.4 milligrams of vitamin B6;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;0.4 milligrams of vitamin B6&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is roughly 25% of the daily recommended intake for adults. The benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a64819302/vitamin-b6-vs-b12/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin B6;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin B6&lt;/a&gt; are vast, but it particularly helps &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4772032/#:~:text=Beyond%20its%20role%20as%20a,noradrenaline%20and%20the%20hormone%20melatonin." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, aiding the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine that regulate mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provides energy boost without the crash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas are predominantly made up of carbohydrates, with about&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4772032/#:~:text=Beyond%20its%20role%20as%20a,noradrenaline%20and%20the%20hormone%20melatonin." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:27 grams per medium banana;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt; 27 grams per medium banana&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to their natural sugars and the fiber they contain, bananas provide a steady source of energy, making them ideal before a workout or as a pick-me-up snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contains antioxidants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas contain several antioxidants, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10465879/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including vitamin C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;including vitamin C&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals in the body, reducing oxidative stress and potentially lowering the risk of certain chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great for Hydration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because bananas are about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:75% water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;75% water&lt;/a&gt;, they contribute to your overall hydration. Combining their potassium content with this water content makes them a fantastic post-workout snack to help replenish lost electrolytes and fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Banana nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A medium-sized banana is considered a single serving. Here’s the breakdown of what you get in &lt;a href="https://snaped.fns.usda.gov/resources/nutrition-education-materials/seasonal-produce-guide/bananas#:~:text=Serving%20Size%3A%201%20medium%20banana,105" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one medium banana:;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one medium banana:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calories: 105&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates: 27 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber: 3 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugars: 14 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein: 1 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fat: 0.3 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you eat too many bananas?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While bananas are packed with nutrients, like any food, they’re best enjoyed in moderation. Eating too many bananas in a short timeframe may result in an overload of certain nutrients, such as potassium. Though this is rare, too much potassium (a condition called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15184-hyperkalemia-high-blood-potassium" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hyperkalemia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hyperkalemia&lt;/a&gt;) can lead to issues like heart irregularities if your kidneys can’t process the excess properly, or even dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, eating one to two bananas a day is perfectly safe. If you focus on a balanced diet with a variety of fruits, it prevents overdoing any one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider is bananas’ carbohydrate and sugar content. If you’re monitoring your blood sugar closely, be mindful of your portion size and pair bananas with some protein or fat, like almond butter or yogurt, to help support healthy blood glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to eat more bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re ready to increase your banana intake, there are plenty of easy (and delicious) ways to do it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoothies&lt;/strong&gt;: Slice a banana and toss it into your blender with yogurt, milk, and your favorite fruits for a quick breakfast or snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On toast&lt;/strong&gt;: Pair banana slices with nut butter on whole grain toast for a filling, balanced meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desserts&lt;/strong&gt;: Freeze ripe bananas to make creamy “nice cream” as a healthier alternative to ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baking&lt;/strong&gt;: Use mashed bananas in recipes like banana bread or muffins for natural sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toppings&lt;/strong&gt;: Add sliced bananas to your cereal, oatmeal, or yogurt for some extra flavor and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eating a banana every day for a week, I can confidently say that incorporating a banana into your daily routine comes with some impressive benefits. They’re convenient, affordable, and packed with essential nutrients like B6 and C that can boost energy, support digestion, and enhance overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, balance and variety are key.

But when it becomes constant, due to processed food, poor sleep, pollution, or hidden infections, it begins to harm instead. It breaks down healthy tissue, supports tumor growth, and messes with immune responses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seyfried and others stress an anti-inflammatory lifestyle: whole foods, clean fats, enough sleep, and minimal toxins. Even small changes, like swapping refined oils with cold-pressed ones, or eating more green vegetables, can lower this dangerous fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only.

EEE was also found in a mosquito sample collected in Belchertown on July 21. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Catherine M. Brown, the state’s epidemiologist, said Thursday that the infected mosquito found in Bridgewater is a species “we know will bite humans.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The fact that we’ve only had two findings so far, and they’re in different parts of the state, is a little bit encouraging,” Brown said. “It gives us less time for amplification.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Brown said most human cases occur in August and early September. Once the weather gets cold, mosquitoes die off, she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The state Department of Public Health currently rates Bridgewater and most of southeastern Massachusetts at “low risk” for EEE and West Nile, Bridgewater officials said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;EEE, a mosquito-borne virus, kills 30 percent of people who develop a severe case of the illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many people who survive a severe case experience ongoing neurological issues, the agency said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;EEE often infects birds, which experience no symptoms. Mosquitos become infected when they bite infected birds, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/eee-eastern-equine-encephalitis#:~:text=EEE%20is%20a%20very%20rare,can%20occur%20throughout%20the%20state." target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/eee-eastern-equine-encephalitis#:~:text=EEE%20is%20a%20very%20rare,can%20occur%20throughout%20the%20state."&gt;fact sheet&lt;/a&gt; issued by the public health department. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Early symptoms in humans include high fever, stiff neck, headache, and lack of energy, according to the department. Symptoms occur three to 10 days after the bite of an infected mosquito. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There is no treatment for EEE. Patients with severe cases sometimes go into a coma within a week, the department said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The most dangerous complication of the disease is swelling of the brain, according to the department.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Few people recover completely,” the department wrote in the fact sheet. “People who survive this disease will often be permanently disabled.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In light of the positive test in Belchertown, officials in Easthampton this week advised residents to reduce the risk of mosquito bites by applying insect repellent, avoiding outdoor activities during peak mosquito hours — dusk and dawn — and wearing long sleeves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Additionally, officials advised residents to eliminate standing water, where mosquitoes lay their eggs, from areas near their homes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Check rain gutters and drains,” officials said. “Empty any unused flowerpots and wading pools, and change the water in birdbaths frequently.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Brown said officials will continue monitoring mosquito samples across the state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

                &lt;p&gt;As an obesity doctor, a nutrition researcher, and a professor of medicine and aging, Kurt Hong has dedicated his life to understanding the link between our &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/essential-healthy-habits-for-your-twenties-thirties-longevity-advice-2023-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;diets and longevity&lt;/a&gt; and helping patients avoid diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his career isn't entirely selfless, he told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I always joke with my wife that I also do this for selfish reasons," Hong said, "I'm always looking for ways to stay young."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the 52-year-old father of three, age is just a number thanks to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oral-microbiome-clean-teeth-live-longer-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;lifestyle choices &lt;/a&gt;we can make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your body may tell you you're 52 years old, but you can behave or you can feel like a 35-year-old," he said.

In a 2019 study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, which followed more than 12,000 people for 29 years, those who reported eating about four to five servings of plants a day, and little to no processed or red meat, were 18 to 25% less likely to die prematurely&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;than those who relied more on meat and other animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="0b3b83d4-7a88-4928-8daa-e08989ca76d5" data-toc-id="0b3b83d4-7a88-4928-8daa-e08989ca76d5"&gt;Eat a lot of fish&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hong's main source of animal protein is fish, because it's rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and protein. "I eat a lot of fish," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-mediterranean-diet-recommendations-from-dietitian-shopping-list-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Wild-caught salmon&lt;/a&gt;, albacore tuna, and halibut are his favorites, and he mostly bakes or poaches them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish contains &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/taking-omega-3-supplements-may-slow-down-aging-study-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which are essential for brain health.

But while proper hydration is important for your health and avoiding heat-related illness, doctors say that going about it the wrong way could mess with your stomach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Issues specifically show up in the form of acid reflux, aka gastroesophageal reflux. It seems weird, but drinking too much water or having water at certain times of day raises the risk of uncomfortable reflux symptoms, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/ashkan-farhadi" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Ashkan Farhadi" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68838183e4b036c6e702ec95" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/ashkan-farhadi" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Ashkan Farhadi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reason behind this is a little complicated and taps into body mechanics. But if you’re prone to reflux, it’s important to be aware that your summer hydration habits could be making things worse. With that in mind, we tapped four gastroenterologists to explain how water can exacerbate symptoms of reflux, plus how to stay well hydrated without raising the risk of symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, it’s important to understand why reflux happens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gastroesophageal reflux is a condition that happens when contents of your stomach come back up into your esophagus, the long tube that connects your throat to your stomach, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/acid-reflux-ger-gerd-adults/definition-facts" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68838183e4b036c6e702ec95" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/acid-reflux-ger-gerd-adults/definition-facts" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(NIDDK). Many people experience this once in a while, and you can even have reflux without noticing any symptoms. People who do have symptoms may experience heartburn, regurgitation, nausea, pain while swallowing, a chronic cough or hoarseness, per the NIDDK.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gastroesophageal reflux usually happens when the lower esophageal sphincter, which serves as a lid that keeps stomach acid and other contents from flowing back into the esophagus, becomes weak or relaxes when it shouldn’t, Farhadi explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinking too much water can exacerbate acid reflux symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to guzzle a bunch of water at once in the summer, but pacing yourself may be easier on your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drinking large amounts of water can increase the volume of the stomach,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.vanderbilthealth.com/doctors/naik-rishi" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Rishi Naik" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68838183e4b036c6e702ec95" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vanderbilthealth.com/doctors/naik-rishi" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Rishi Naik&lt;/a&gt;, gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “When the volume of the stomach increases, it increases pressure, which then leads to upward pressure through your lower esophageal sphincter.” That can increase reflux, causing uncomfortable symptoms in the process, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Guido Mieth via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Guido Mieth via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Pacing your water intake can be easier on your stomach, experts say.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This esophageal sphincter acts like a valve to protect your esophagus from reflux but, when there is too much pressure, this can lead to backup through the valve into the esophagus which can worsen acid reflux symptoms,” Naik said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Water isn’t acidic, pointed out &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/subhankar-chakraborty-md-phd-99969" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Subhankar Chakraborty" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68838183e4b036c6e702ec95" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/subhankar-chakraborty-md-phd-99969" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Subhankar Chakraborty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.

It’s always better to be satiated, but not overfilled.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People with reflux tend to have more symptoms after meals, so drinking too much water at this point can add to the problem, Chakraborty said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how to navigate summer hydration without acid reflux symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a few things you can do to lower the risk of acid reflux symptoms, both in terms of drinking water and other health hacks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“To help prevent reflux, it’s better to drink small amounts of water throughout the day instead of drinking a lot at once, especially during or right after meals,” Chakraborty said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Naik also suggests walking after meals. “This increases motility — your ability for your stomach to squeeze — and moves [stomach contents] further down into your gastrointestinal tract to prevent esophageal reflux,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stein recommends being realistic about your hydration needs, too. “Drinking enough fluids in the day is not as hard as it sounds if you keep up from the start of the day to the end,” she said. Her advice: Drink when you feel thirsty, and try to have a steady amount of water throughout the day vs. downing a lot at once. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I usually remind people to drink a little when they wake up, have a little with breakfast, have a mid-morning sip, sip something with lunch, something in the afternoon, something with dinner, and something in the early evening,” she said. (You can keep an eye on your urine color to see if you’re well-hydrated: It should be clear to pale yellow.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Kahn, now 33, noticed a few bats flying around but didn’t worry about them — until one flew up to her and got tangled between her camera and her face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UKMNUD4HD5GNJI5ZQ5XTON4MME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;She screamed, and part of the bat went into her mouth.

Regardless, her father, who is a physician and was traveling with her, said she should go to a hospital within a day or so and begin &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2021/09/29/illinois-rabies-bat/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccinations against rabies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DYNKLD4L6RCMFMDBE7QK5V4GPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Figuring she would be covered as long as she obtained insurance before going to the hospital, Kahn said, she found a policy online the day after the bat incident. She said she called the company before she bought its policy and was told that services related to an accident or “life-threatening” emergency would be covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7XNPVV723JDEXDU552QSADZ4KE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn went the next day to a hospital in Flagstaff, Arizona, where she started rabies prevention treatment. Over the next two weeks, she received the rest of the rabies shots at clinics in Arizona and Massachusetts and at a hospital in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="VXUACWC77VBCLMBXLOLHMAJWFM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="VXUACWC77VBCLMBXLOLHMAJWFM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The medical procedure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WTN3BXQCRRDCDI5R4KON4CJM3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn received a total of four doses of the rabies vaccine.

Experts &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/prevention-recommendations/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommend precautionary measures&lt;/a&gt; when a person has been potentially exposed to rabies, because once the neurological disease causes symptoms, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;it is fatal&lt;/a&gt;. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says postexposure rabies treatment has reduced the number of human fatalities to fewer than 10 per year in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="Y44O6TEG3VCPVLI6TSE7GDLAFU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="Y44O6TEG3VCPVLI6TSE7GDLAFU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The final bill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QZI7JDIKTZGIBHEJNME6VZG364" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to explanation-of-benefits statements, Kahn owed a total of $20,749 for her care at the four facilities.

But as a young, healthy person, she gambled that she could get by without insurance until she found another job. She figured that if she needed medical care, she could quickly buy a private policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VJODOWLT3FCTZNMVZPJCUDNCL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services, those who qualify for COBRA must be given &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/cciio/programs-and-initiatives/other-insurance-protections/cobra_qna" target="_blank"&gt;at least 60 days&lt;/a&gt; to sign up — and if they do, the coverage applies retroactively. Kahn, who was still within that period at the time of the incident, said recently that she did not realize she had that option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="55UT7MC56NDHJD4AUJNXTKJHMY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The policy she purchased after the bat episode, which cost about $311 a month, was from a Florida company called Innovative Partners LP. Documents Kahn provided to KFF Health News say the policy has a 30-day waiting period, which “does not apply to benefits regarding an accident or loss of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZSRHIY3TUNCW5LHWJ6ESAUMRRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn said that after receiving notice that her claims were denied, she called the company to ask how she could appeal and was told that a doctor would have to file paperwork.

The disease is deadly, and the fact that the bat went into her mouth meant she could have been infected from its saliva, he said: “You could hardly have a more direct exposure than that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CZ5FJ4XTXRGPXHCQTMJLIWMRIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Shlim, who recently co-wrote &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/travel-associated-infections-diseases/rabies.html" target="_blank"&gt;a federal advisory about rabies prevention&lt;/a&gt;, added that healthy bats don’t normally fly into people, as the one in this case did.

Scientists report that psilocybin not only extends the lifespan of aging mice but also delays cellular aging in human cells. The research, which offers the first experimental evidence of psilocybin’s anti-aging effects, points to its potential as a treatment for age-related diseases and as a broader intervention to promote healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings have been published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41514-025-00244-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nature Partnering Journal (NPJ) Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic substance produced by mushrooms of the Psilocybe genus. When ingested, the compound is quickly converted in the body to psilocin, which interacts with serotonin receptors in the brain. These interactions are believed to produce the profound changes in perception and mood often associated with psychedelic experiences. In recent years, psilocybin has gained attention for its promising effects in treating depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. However, until now, little was known about how it might influence aging at a cellular or systemic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the new study, based at Emory University and Baylor College of Medicine, set out to explore whether psilocybin could affect biological markers of aging beyond the brain. They were motivated by a theory linking mental health and cellular aging, sometimes called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2019.109406" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the “psilocybin-telomere hypothesis.” &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hypothesis proposes that treatments improving mental well-being might also slow biological aging processes, such as the shortening of telomeres. Telomeres are the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, and their erosion is associated with aging and the development of chronic diseases, including cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A friend of mine had been asking me about psilocybin for months, which finally prompted me to spend some time reading what is known about it scientifically,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-hecker-69ba1915" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Louise Hecker&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine. “I was immediately fascinated by how many different clinical indications it was being used for. One article posed a hypothesis that perhaps it is acting on telomeres, which could potentially explain its durable effects. I thought – I can test that!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the researchers used both laboratory-grown human cells and living mice. For the cell studies, they treated human lung and skin fibroblasts—cells responsible for producing connective tissue—with psilocin, the active form of psilocybin. These cells were grown in culture over time, and their rate of aging was monitored by measuring how many times they could divide before reaching senescence, a state where cells stop dividing. The team found that cells exposed to psilocin lived significantly longer than untreated cells. At a lower dose, psilocin extended cellular lifespan by 29 percent, while a higher dose resulted in a 57 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond lifespan extension, psilocin-treated cells also showed lower levels of stress-related markers. These cells had less oxidative stress, fewer signs of DNA damage, and greater preservation of telomere length compared to untreated cells. Molecular analysis revealed increased expression of SIRT1, a protein known to promote cell survival and regulate aging-related genes, and reduced levels of GADD45a, a marker of DNA damage. Collectively, the results suggested that psilocin not only delays cellular aging but does so by enhancing mechanisms involved in stress resistance and genetic stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then tested whether psilocybin could influence aging in living animals. They selected 19-month-old female mice—roughly equivalent to 60 to 65 human years—and administered psilocybin once per month for 10 months. The dosing regimen was designed to mimic protocols used in clinical trials for humans, adjusted to account for the faster metabolism in mice. The mice that received psilocybin had a significantly higher survival rate by the end of the study compared to those given a placebo. Eighty percent of the psilocybin-treated mice were still alive, compared to only 50 percent of the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrates, for the first time, that psilocybin has potent systemic impacts which can improve survival, even when administered late in life,” Hecker told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the researchers did not measure behavior or disease onset in detail, they reported that the treated mice appeared healthier, with improved fur quality and fewer signs of age-related decline. These observations, while preliminary, suggest that psilocybin’s benefits may go beyond lifespan and extend to overall health and physical condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the experiment, the psilocybin-treated mice not only looked better than the vehicle-treated group, but they looked better than they did at the start of the experiment,” Hecker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also touches on broader public health concerns. In the United States, life expectancy has lagged behind other high-income countries, and chronic age-related illnesses remain a major burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali John Zarrabi, a co-investigator on the study and director of psychedelic research at Emory University, noted that the results have implications for how aging is managed. “This study provides strong preclinical evidence that psilocybin may contribute to healthier aging — not just a longer lifespan, but a better quality of life in later years,” he said. “As a palliative care physician-scientist, one of my biggest concerns is prolonging life at the cost of dignity and function. But these mice weren’t just surviving longer — they experienced better aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study’s findings are promising, the authors caution that more research is needed before psilocybin could be used as an anti-aging therapy in humans. The experiments were conducted under tightly controlled conditions and involved a relatively small number of mice. Only female mice were included, which helped avoid variability linked to sex-based biological differences but also limits the generalizability of the results. Future studies will need to test whether the same effects occur in male mice, in other species, and eventually in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also questions about the long-term safety of psilocybin, particularly with repeated dosing. Although the researchers did not observe any signs of cancer or unchecked cell growth in the treated cells, extending the lifespan of cells without appropriate checks could, in theory, increase the risk of malignancies. The authors stress that future studies should investigate whether long-term psilocybin use has any influence on cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is only the first study to evaluate the impacts of psilocybin on aging,” Hecker noted. “”Many more questions still need to be answered: Are there sex-specific differences in efficacy? What is the optimal treatment protocol (ex dose, frequency)? Are there potential adverse effects associated with long term psilocybin treatment?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal status of psilocybin remains another challenge. As a Schedule I substance under federal law in the United States, access to psilocybin for research purposes is tightly regulated, and funding for such studies is limited. These restrictions have slowed the pace of scientific exploration, even as early results suggest wide-ranging benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these hurdles, interest in psilocybin’s therapeutic potential is growing. The United States Food and Drug Administration has granted “breakthrough therapy” status to psilocybin for depression, a designation that signals its potential for substantial clinical benefit. Dozens of clinical trials are currently underway to test psilocybin for conditions ranging from anxiety to chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Hecker hopes “to determine the optimal dosing regimen and monitor the potential for adverse effects at the pre-clinical level for successful clinical translation,” Hecker said. “This is a new frontier in psilocybin research! Psilocybin holds great potential as a novel anti-aging intervention. I hope this study sparks many more studies to better understand the potential of psilocybin for aging and age-related diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41514-025-00244-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Psilocybin treatment extends cellular lifespan and improves survival of aged mice&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Kosuke Kato, Jennifer M.

No gym membership required. Just a pair of shoes and a willingness to alternate between brisk and slow-paced walking in three-minute bursts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubbed “Japanese walking,” the latest viral fitness trend is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/japanese-walking?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;all over TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and has people wondering whether this short-interval workout can improve health more efficiently than a traditional stroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend has spread across social media and beyond, with bloggers, online articles and major media outlets all jumping in on the walking routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol traces back to a&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619611613037" target="_blank"&gt; 2007 Japanese study&lt;/a&gt; that tested the effects of high-intensity interval walking on middle-aged and older adults. But the recent buzz started with a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@coacheugeneteo/video/7509367099370802448" target="_blank"&gt;punchy video&lt;/a&gt; from Australian content creator and fitness coach Eugene Teo that surpassed 10 million views on TikTok and 17 million views on YouTube. Known to his over 426,000 TikTok followers and 1.22 million YouTube followers as “Coach Eugene,” Teo rebranded the science-backed routine into an accessible, algorithm-friendly idea: “Japanese walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People don’t like fitness jargon,” Teo, 33, said in a recent interview with The Times. “They don’t like scientific terms … and if I want to impact millions globally ... I like to make fitness advice and scientific jargon a lot more accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his video explainer, Teo describes the method: Walk fast for three minutes, slow down for three minutes and repeat the cycle five times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the small study of 186 women and 60 men, participants who followed this routine four or more days a week saw greater improvements in blood pressure, leg strength and aerobic capacity than those in the moderate-intensity continuous walking group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s that cardio work that a lot of people are missing,” Teo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teo, a longtime coach and nutritionist, didn’t invent the protocol, but he did help it reach millions. He said his viral video resonated with people overwhelmed by the pressure to hit 10,000 steps a day — a goal Teo himself often finds out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s been following this protocol on and off for years, ever since he came across the study. Usually, he does his walking on a treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people have this all-or-nothing approach where they think, ‘Oh, I can’t hit 10,000 steps. I’ve failed,’” he said. “It’s about just changing the stigma people have and that all-or-nothing mentality ... of what fitness should be about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasizes effort over perfection: Walk fast enough to get out of breath, but not so fast that you can’t finish the three-minute interval. The recovery periods are as slow as needed to reset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is the science behind the trend as strong as the messaging? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Helga Van Herle, a cardiologist with Keck Medicine of USC, noted flaws in the original study’s design — namely, that only the high-intensity walking group was monitored with accelerometers, not the moderate intensity group, a bias that could have skewed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This creates a major bias in the monitoring and compliance and could potentially skew the results in favor of the high-intensity training group,” she said in an email, pointing to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/hawthorne/09.html" target="_blank"&gt;the Hawthorne effect&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon in which people alter their behavior because they know they’re being watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Parveen Garg, also with Keck Medicine of USC, said he doesn’t see intense interval walking as a standout recommendation among physicians. The study, he said, was small and meant to be thought-provoking and encourage further research, not to support sweeping conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He supports any activity that gets people moving but cautions against over-hyping Japanese walking benefits or ease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of onerous,” he said, explaining that remembering to switch gears every three minutes, walking fast and slow and navigating technology isn’t easy for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it’s possible to get similar benefits by walking continuously at a vigorous pace for a shorter time. But there isn’t enough evidence to confirm that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts agree that vigorous activity, even in short spurts, is beneficial. David Raichlen, professor of biological sciences and anthropology at USC, said short intervals of increased effort — even just walking briskly for a few minutes — can yield meaningful health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-left&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc16566/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/320x214!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bca416d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/568x380!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24ca0e5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/768x514!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/60e4d63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/1024x685!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8eebac6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/1200x803!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt='A graphic of data related to “Japanese walking."' srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6e0c8e2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/320x214!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/28c8f44/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/568x380!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3bf8665/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/768x514!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3af7eac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/1024x685!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b7d87ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/1200x803!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b7d87ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1076x720+0+0/resize/1200x803!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F94%2F4b%2F1c7450584a2cafa2d77f7a43c1dc%2Fjapanese-walking-google-trends-data.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Searches for “Japanese walking” have increased over the past year, particularly since April.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Google Trends)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s something to the idea that small amounts of vigorous activity are really beneficial,” Raichlen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raichlen also noted that calling high-intensity interval walking “Japanese walking” simply because of the study’s origin is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasuyuki Suzuki, a cardiac imaging specialist from Tokyo, is aware of the trend and the associated study. He said that while there is some new interest in the topic, it is not trending in Japan the way it appears to be in other parts of the world. He also said he does not feel any discomfort or concern about it being referred to as “Japanese walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for whether this method is better than 10,000 steps or continuous walking, Raichlen is hesitant to say — the research just isn’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher walking cadence has been linked to lower dementia risk, Raichlen said. Also, walking in general has been tied to lower mortality, reduced cancer risk and improved cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do think there’s a lot of good from encouraging people to think about walking as exercise,” Raichlen said. “Finding ways to sort of make walking work better for you is, you know, not a bad thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the simplicity and catchy name may be why it took off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pretty much anybody in Los Angeles can go outside and walk around,” said Sarah T. Roberts, a UCLA associate professor and internet culture expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts sees the trend as a reflection of broader social forces, including medical mistrust and the rising cost of health care and fitness. “We’re in a moment of economic uncertainty,” she said. “For most people, a $300-a-month membership at Equinox is not a reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, she said, makes low-barrier trends like “Japanese walking” especially appealing. But Roberts cautioned against the risks of turning to TikTok and other social media platforms for medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stuff doesn’t happen in a vacuum,” she said. “There’s a bigger social and political context to all of these things, and the backdrop to these kinds of trends is not great.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts encourages viewers to critically evaluate where their health advice comes from and who profits from it. “People with big followings often have something to sell,” she said. “They’re not really acting in the public interest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Roberts said, with every health trend, social media companies are profiting. Although some platforms have tried to crack down on medical misinformation, Roberts said such content moderation has fallen out of favor because it affects revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Devaluing expertise means devaluing the collective knowledge that people have in certain domains,” Roberts said. “If I try to fix my own car, my car is probably not going to run very well. Now apply that to my body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teo said fitness trends should be approached with discernment. He’s not claiming to replace traditional walking — just to offer a stepping stone for cardio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if a viral name is what it takes to get people walking, he’s OK with that. “As long as you’re not misleading people,” he said, “and there’s legitimate substance behind it, it’s a great way to spin things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teo, Raichlen, Garg and Roberts all agree on one thing: Talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise routine, especially one that reaches vigorous intensity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNSFNjQ0dyMElqLWRBRFBSZlVTZXAwcld5OUp5Y05BNC1XLUx1b1Bhc3lvZ1dwRVd3d0JNOUprcXBxVG51QU1qcnBKeWktdjYwVFNEYmd1YWdfN1pNSHRPU2F3RFl6SlFuNW56NUFxVlpqSm5lbU1KU0hyVUVJVS1wcGhqQXJnQmlXTFE</guid></item><item><title>慢性病？在肯尼迪看来，这可能是你自己的错- KFF健康新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxPOGQ4WjBDTnA3LXpma1pMaFVpSVFMWHZPVExBOFIzTExjSFZNcG9EWTFieEZhT3JOQm94OVhJY3RZMGlMS1pCRXljcFpqSEl4Yk5JOVFuQnVULTBLMmZWWTc0SUVpNnFpMFpiODFNOFdGczhLV0RXeVlKZmoyanI3RWFlU0N6aEk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;
								
&lt;p&gt;On a recent weekday evening, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashly-richards-1610aa44/"&gt;Ashly Richards&lt;/a&gt; helped her 13-year-old son, Case, with homework. He did math problems and some reading, underscoring how much he’s accomplished at his school for children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Richards has heard Trump administration officials suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNeIZkacWkk"&gt;food dyes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZofNzZ8UoPk"&gt;pediatric vaccines&lt;/a&gt; cause autism and ADHD. That stance, she said, unfairly blames parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s no evidence to support it,” said Richards, 44, a marketing director in Richmond, Virginia. “As a parent, it’s infuriating.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their zeal to “Make America Healthy Again,” Trump administration officials are making statements that some advocacy and medical groups say depict patients and the doctors who treat them as partly responsible for whatever ails them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and agency leaders have attributed a panoply of chronic diseases and other medical issues — such as autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, diabetes, and obesity — to consumers and their lifestyle choices, according to a review of 15 hours of recorded interviews, social media statements, and federal reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said at a news conference on April 16 that &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/apr/24/RFK-jr-environmental-toxins-causing-autism/"&gt;autism is preventable&lt;/a&gt; and that rates are rising because of toxic substances in the environment, despite a lack of evidence there is any link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are kids who will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date,” he said. “Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of people on the spectrum do not have those severe challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statements are more than rhetoric. These attitudes, ranging from judgments about individual behaviors to criticism of the chronically poor, are shaping policies that affect millions of people. The sentiments have been a factor behind decisions to cut Medicaid, keep federal insurance programs from covering anti-obesity drugs, and impose new barriers to covid vaccines for healthy people, say public health leaders and doctors. GOP lawmakers and federal health officials, they say, hold a reproachful stance toward chronic illnesses and the estimated 129 million people in the U.S. affected by them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is at the heart of so much of our national problem with health,” said Robert Califf, who led the Food and Drug Administration during the Obama and Biden administrations. “It’s these two extreme views. It’s every health decision is up to the ‘rugged individual,’ versus the other extreme view that it’s all controlled by environment and social determinants of health. The truth is, it’s on a continuum.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Blame Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Self-reliance is a common theme among adherents of MAHA, an informal movement for which Kennedy has fashioned himself the figurehead that promotes medical freedom, skepticism of vaccines, and a focus on nontraditional medicine to treat disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking medication to manage diabetes? FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested on &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/robert-f-kennedy-jrs-fda-commissioner-marty-makarty-suggests-diabetics-get-cooking-classes-over-insulin/"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; in late May that it would be effective to “treat more diabetes with cooking classes” instead of “just throwing insulin at people.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin because their pancreases don’t produce it, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/insulin-medicines-treatments#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20type%201,another%20option%20for%20some%20people."&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, which also notes that many with Type 2 diabetes “need to take diabetes medicines as well.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking birth control pills? Casey Means, President Donald Trump’s nominee to be U.S. surgeon general, has said that’s a “disrespect of life” for short-term gain and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are prescribing them like candy,” she said last year on “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUH4Co2wE-I"&gt;The Tucker Carlson Show&lt;/a&gt;,” adding that birth control medications “are literally shutting down the hormones in the female body that create this cyclical, life-giving nature of women.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Have a child on ADHD meds? &lt;a href="https://calleymeans.com/"&gt;Calley Means&lt;/a&gt;, who is an adviser to Kennedy and is Casey Means’ brother, said on the same show that Adderall is prescribed as the standard of care when children get a little fidgety because they’re in sedentary environments with limited sunlight and eat too much ultraprocessed food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a society, he said, “we’re really committing mass child abuse in many ways, and we’re normalizing that and we’re not speaking out about that. And then we’re giving people stimulants developed by Nazi Germany.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Calley Means was probably referring to Pervitin, a &lt;a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/the-nazi-death-machine-hitler-s-drugged-soldiers-a-354606.html"&gt;methamphetamine-based&lt;/a&gt; drug administered to Adolf Hitler’s forces in World War II. Adderall is a prescription drug containing amphetamine, a stimulant that’s &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/how-do-adderall-and-meth-methamphetamine-differ#differences"&gt;not the same&lt;/a&gt; as methamphetamine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services didn’t respond to messages seeking comment from Means.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some conservatives and MAHA adherents argue that people need to take more responsibility for their health. But comments that shift blame to patients and physicians risk perpetuating stigmas, fostering the spread of misinformation, and eroding trust in modern medicine, say medical groups, doctors, and patient advocacy groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statements assume consumers and patients have control over improving their health and preventing chronic disease when the reality is more complex, according to some public health leaders. Lower-income people, they say, often lack access to grocery stores and healthy food, may juggle too many jobs to have time to cook from scratch, and may live in dangerous areas where it’s harder to get outside and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.uschamberfoundation.org/surgeongeneral/680209"&gt;Jerome Adams&lt;/a&gt;, surgeon general during the previous Trump administration, told KFF Health News that he worries efforts to promote health will be undone by “the return of vaccine-preventable diseases, increasing mistrust in the health care system, and the tearing down of social supports which are critical for making healthy choices.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tough Talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attitudes held by top Trump health officials have affected policy decisions, some doctors and public health leaders say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and other Trump administration health leaders have been especially outspoken, targeting issues they consider especially egregious in recent federal actions, research, or policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, the Biden administration proposed &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-medicare-advantage-and-medicare-part-d-prescription-drug"&gt;a rule&lt;/a&gt; in November that would let Medicare cover weight loss medications such as Wegovy and Zepbound. But Kennedy and other political appointees at HHS and its agencies have criticized the drugs and the people who take them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s very dark,” Calley Means &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUH4Co2wE-I"&gt;told Carlson&lt;/a&gt;, referring to the weight loss drugs. “I think it’s a stranglehold on the U.S. population, almost like solidifying this idea that there is a magic pill.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added: “Where is the urgency on saying ‘Hey parents, maybe we shouldn’t feed our kids toxic food?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, too, has criticized the medications and people who use them, saying in October on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/robertfkennedyjr/reel/DBWPFf4PmFV/"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; that drugmakers “are counting on selling it to Americans because we’re so stupid and so addicted to drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In April, the Trump administration announced it would not finalize the Biden-era coverage rule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s impacting the kind of care and treatments patients will have,” said Andrea Love, a biomedical scientist and founder of ImmunoLogic, a science communication organization. “It sends the message that it’s your fault. It’s very much victim-blaming. It creates the idea that scientific progress is the devil, demonizes things that aren’t individually harming health, while avoiding addressing systemic issues that play a much larger role in health.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and HHS didn’t return messages seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data shows that the medications are effective. People who took the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/zepbound-explained-glp-1-weight-loss-drug-fda-approval#:~:text=The%20FDA%20approval%20of%20Zepbound,25%25%20of%20their%20body%20weight."&gt;highest dose of Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; in clinical trials lost an average of 48 pounds, and 1 in 3 on that dose lost more than 58 pounds, or 25% of their body weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and other agency leaders also oppose many covid-era health restrictions and rules. Some physicians and public health leaders note these officials downplayed covid risks while criticizing vaccines developed during the previous Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has said that people who died from covid actually fell victim to chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, or asthma.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s really what killed them,” Kennedy said on “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZofNzZ8UoPk"&gt;Dr. Phil Primetime&lt;/a&gt;” in April. “These were people who were so sick they were basically hanging from a cliff, and covid came along and stamped on their fingers and dropped them off. But they were already living lives that were burdened by sickness.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Covid was the underlying cause of death for more than &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2800816"&gt;940,000 people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. from Aug. 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022, according to a 2023 report in JAMA Network, an open-access journal on biomedical sciences published by the American Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Covid ranked first among deaths caused by infectious or respiratory diseases for youths under age 19, based on the report. Infants under a year old may be at higher risk of experiencing severe illness from covid compared with older children, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-in-babies-and-children/art-20484405"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;, and risks are also higher for infants under 6 months and those with underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/protecting-infants-and-children-from-covid-19-associated-hospitalization.html"&gt;Vaccination during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; can help protect infants after birth,” according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy announced in May that the federal government would no longer recommend covid vaccines for pregnant people and children who are healthy. Medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics opposed this decision and filed a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also helped promote beliefs that many childless adults on Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people, don’t work and thereby drain resources from the program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a May hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Kennedy said the program was in jeopardy because of “all the able-bodied people who are not working [or] looking for jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a view embraced by Republican lawmakers who portrayed adults enrolled in Medicaid as lazy or shirking work as they advanced a budget bill estimated to cut federal spending on the program by about $1 trillion over a decade, in part by imposing work requirements on many adult beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Thirty-five-year-olds sitting at home playing video games, they’re going to now have to go get a job,” said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The legislation, which Trump signed into law this month, will cause about 10 million more people to be without health insurance by 2034, &lt;a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61569"&gt;the Congressional Budget Office estimates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some health leaders who criticized the legislation say the statements inaccurately maligned Medicaid enrollees, who by law cannot hold high-paying jobs and remain in the program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, nearly two-thirds of adults ages 19 to 64 covered by Medicaid in 2023 were working. For about 3 in 10, caregiving responsibilities, an illness or disability, or school attendance prevented them from working, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/understanding-the-intersection-of-medicaid-and-work-an-update/"&gt;according to KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s using anti-welfare tropes for something that is basic health care, not a cash benefit,” said Anthony Wright, executive director at Families USA, which supports the Affordable Care Act and expanded health coverage. He summarized the Republican message: “We’re going to make it harder to get the help you need by imposing a bunch of paperwork, and if you don’t get it, it’s your fault.”&lt;/p&gt;

After some digging, she discovered that a local shop had been selling these weapons to him.

staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;CasyD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What makes moms so protective of their children, according to science?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many mothers will go to great lengths to shield their &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-parenthood-memes-pregnantchicken/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; from harm. Maybe not quite as dramatically as the mom in this story, but research does show that mothers tend to be more preoccupied with their kids’ safety than fathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/01/24/gender-and-parenting/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; survey revealed that 51% of mothers describe themselves as overprotective compared to 38% of fathers. Moms also report being more anxious about their children facing tough challenges in life, whether that’s dealing with depression, bullying, or physical danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesagencycouncil/2020/03/03/mothers-have-higher-fear-and-anxiety-than-fathers-what-does-it-mean-for-brands/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that 89% of mothers worry about the overall safety of the world their children live in, compared to 66% of fathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why do moms feel such an intense drive to protect their children? Is it purely maternal instinct, the physical bond from &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/lesser-known-things-pregnancy-child-birth/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and birth, or the societal expectations placed on mothers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_3" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While experts continue to debate the causes, one intriguing study published in &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/24080" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;eLife&lt;/a&gt; dug deeper into the biology behind this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="sold-knife-kid-angry-mother-malicious-compliance-88" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/sold-knife-kid-angry-mother-malicious-compliance/?image_id=sold-knife-kid-angry-mother-malicious-compliance-88.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Shop Owner Says If You Don’t Like It, Tell The News, So This Mom Did Exactly That" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/sold-knife-kid-angry-mother-malicious-compliance/?media_id=sold-knife-kid-angry-mother-malicious-compliance-88" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sold-knife-kid-angry-mother-malicious-compliance-88.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9107264" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sold-knife-kid-angry-mother-malicious-compliance-88.jpg" alt='Shop Owner Says "If You Don’t Like It, Tell The News", So This Mom Did Exactly That' title='Shop Owner Says "If You Don’t Like It, Tell The News", So This Mom Did Exactly That' loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://elements.envato.com/mother-and-son-LWDSWM6" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;svetlanas13/Envato (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers wanted to understand why many animals react to threats against their young by freezing or fleeing, whereas humans often leap to defend their children, even at great personal risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, they found, lies in a chemical in the brain called oxytocin, often referred to as the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/oxytocin-the-love-hormone" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;“love hormone.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin is released through touch, bringing those warm, fuzzy feelings you get when hugging, cuddling, or kissing someone you care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During childbirth, it floods the body, driving uterine contractions and later helping the uterus expel the placenta, reducing the risk of postpartum complications. It also calms stress, eases pain during labor, and strengthens the emotional bond between a mother and her newborn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oxytocin is a powerful attachment chemical that drives maternal instinct,” biological anthropologist Helen Fisher (who was not involved in the study) told &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/science-says-love-hormone-drives-mothers-protect-kids-221035596.html" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since oxytocin in the amygdala, the brain’s emotional processing center, prevents animals from freezing in dangerous situations, the eLife researchers decided to test its effects on mother rats who had just given birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They trained the rats to associate the smell of peppermint with danger by pairing it with a mild electric shock. Despite the unpleasant setup, the results were telling:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When oxytocin levels were high, the mother rats actively protected their pups from the danger signal. Some attacked the peppermint-scented tube, while others focused on nursing and keeping their babies close. But when oxytocin was blocked, the mothers froze and left their young to fend for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The babies learned from this behavior, too. Pups whose mothers comforted them recognized peppermint as a threat, while those without that comfort never developed the same sense of danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while rallying a news crew to shut down a shop selling weapons to kids isn’t quite the same scenario, it proves something timeless: a mother’s love is its own unstoppable force of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Watch the footage below&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="video-container"&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ozXJiO_ZGq0?si=6I-91FUIJcwD5cXI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozXJiO_ZGq0" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Howdy Print&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The author revealed that his mother has since passed, but remained every bit as fierce until the very end&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Readers were in awe of her determination&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_5" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_6" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_7" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_8" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_9" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_10" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_11" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div id="postPoll-9102467" class="post-poll poll-wrapper single-post" data-poll-viewed="false" data-post-id="9102467" data-main-post-id="" data-poll-id="15012"&gt; &lt;input class="post-9102467-poll-value" type="hidden" value="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"&gt; &lt;div data-bind="if: isInitialised()"&gt;    &lt;div data-bind="if: !isLoading() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isShowingResults"&gt; &lt;div class="poll-content"&gt; &lt;h3 class="answered-content-title"&gt;Thanks!

The clip shows how this canine’s food preferences changed after the owner’s vegan brother dropped by. His “zesty appetite” left the pet parent surprised. Netizens also couldn’t hold back their laughter, with the video fetching more than 8K likes from viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Instagram video shows Golden Retriever sourcing food from nature&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s a rare sight for pet parents to see their furbabies happily sourcing food from nature. Pets usually depend on their humans for their meals. However, it seems this &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;, Huxley, has taken matters into his own hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The pup’s owner came home to Huxley being a pro at snacking right from the garden without anyone’s help. The dog mom captured her Golden Retriever’s new avatar and shared it on @hugoandursula to show the world his new eating habit, courtesy of her “vegan hippy brother from Berlin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The clip shows how the Golden, without any hesitation, jumps to the shrubs or bushes to pick the ripe fruits and berries for his snack time. In the time his mom was away from home, the canine has upped his foraging skills, clearly becoming a pro at it. Moreover, the pup seems very excited and proud while plucking stuff from the trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This change in Huxley’s diet even left the dog mom amazed. It was a new habit that he developed in her absence, all thanks to her brother, who visited the furbabies to care for them. She even mentioned the diet change in the video’s caption, saying that her “younger brother very kindly came and looked after the boys whilst I was away.. anyways I’ve noticed a couple of changes since I’ve been back, mainly Huxley’s zesty appetite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video of the Golden Retriever and his new diet left netizens in splits. They immediately took this opportunity to share their stories. One dog owner wrote, “My Goldies used to eat the apples from the trees in my  garden .. always foraging.” While another pet parent commented, “Garden snackies are the best snackies.
