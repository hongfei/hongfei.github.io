This is a group of brain disorders that disrupt normal brain development and can lead to intellectual disability, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15148925/epilepsy-cure-childrens-brains.html"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;, movement problems and impulsive behavior, as well as symptoms associated with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, the conditions are caused when someone only has one functional copy of the SYNGAP1 gene instead of the usual two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, scientists in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/washington-state/index.html" id="mol-076e8d60-a514-11f0-9292-7b50e0f25ff3"&gt;Washington state&lt;/a&gt; say they have found a way to repair the damaged gene and potentially help patients function better in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new study, researchers administered juvenile mice suffering from the brain disorder with an altered adenovirus, or a cold virus, that carried a healthy copy of the SYNGAP1 gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The virus successfully delivered the gene to brain cells, with the rodents then experiencing broad improvements in their behavior up to two weeks later, including the near elimination of epilepsy, a neurological disorder where patients suffer from recurrent and unprovoked seizures, and a reduction in hyperactive and risky behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mice also saw a substantial shift in their brain wave patterns, or electrical pulses generated by the brain, from abnormal to much closer to normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Boaz Levy, a biochemist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science who led the study, said: '[This study] is an important milestone for the field that provides hope for those who suffer from this class of severe neurological diseases.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists say they have found a potential new therapy for a brain disorder that can cause autism symptoms in children (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Gene supplementation is providing a functional new copy of a defective gene, a strategy that has great potential for correcting diseases where a gene is completely missing or where a single copy of a gene is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This [study] provides a clear demonstration that SYNGAP1-related disorders can be treated with a neuron-specific gene supplementation strategy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research is in the early stages and was only carried out in mice, with researchers saying clinical trials still need to be done in humans to confirm that the therapy works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But scientists heralded the results as a positive step towards developing a treatment for the condition. It was particularly notable that the study was successful in juvenile mice, which is around the same age at which humans are diagnosed with SRDs and could, therefore, receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 1,500 Americans have been diagnosed with a SYNGAP1-related brain disorder, activists say, although estimates suggest many cases have been missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not all autism and epilepsy cases are caused by SYNGAP1-related disorders, although patients with SRDs may be diagnosed with these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disorders are considered to be a spectrum because the faulty genes often do not affect the brain in exactly the same way or to the same level of severity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is currently no specific treatment or cure for the condition, but doctors say they can help patients to manage symptoms using antiseizure medications or implanting devices into the body that can help to control nerve activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one to two percent of all intellectual disability cases, including autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy, are estimated to be caused by SRD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the therapy, a healthy copy of the faulty gene is delivered to brain cells by an adenovirus, or cold virus. It was successful at improving symptoms in juvenile mice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 31 children in the US has autism, a surge on the one in 150 estimated to have the condition in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some research has suggested that about 80 percent of autism cases are linked to inherited genetic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Robert F Kennedy Jr, the Health and Human Services Secretary, is among those who have argued that the surge in cases cannot be blamed on genetics alone and is likely also down to unidentified environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 470,000 children in the US have epilepsy, with experts also suggesting that the condition is caused by both genetic and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Epilepsy is a common symptom in patients with SYNGAP1-related brain disorders, with more than 80 percent of sufferers also diagnosed with this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the research, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/pdf/S1525-0016(25)00759-2.pdf?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1525001625007592%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Molecular Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, scientists injected the altered adenoviruses into the mice's cerebral ventricles, the fluid-filled cavities in the center of the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The injection was carried out by inserting a needle past the eye and into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is Dr Boaz Levy, left, who led the research, and associate investigator Dr Rong Guo and scientist Dr Meagan Quinlan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is the cross section of the brain of a mouse in the study. The highlighted areas represent locations where the adenovirus delivered the treatment to the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One to two weeks later the rodents were put through a battery of tests to measure the impact of the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests included tracking the movements of mice in a 7.8inch by 7.8inch arena, to check for erratic behavior, and placing them in an elevated maze and monitoring their behavior to estimate anxiety and risk-taking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team concluded: 'Our findings provide the first evidence that... gene therapy can restore SYNGAP1 function and reverse key [symptoms], supporting its potential as a transformative therapeutic for patients.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

School, work, screens – all of those hours on your backside add up, and our bodies don’t appreciate it one bit. A new study warns that long hours sitting causes significant health issues – even for young, active adults – raising the odds of heart disease and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if that news wasn’t bad enough, researchers also argue that today’s federal exercise recommendations don’t fully counteract the harm caused by excessive sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aging studies that focus on people in their 60s, this project zeroed in on younger adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from &lt;a href="https://www.ucr.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Riverside&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/a&gt; analyzed health data from more than 1,000 Colorado residents, with an average age of 33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-risks-from-prolonged-sitting"&gt;Health risks from prolonged sitting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reports that logging eight or more seated hours a day pushes two early warning signs in the wrong direction – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-handful-of-pecan-nuts-each-day-can-lower-cholesterol-heart-health/"&gt;cholesterol ratio&lt;/a&gt; and body mass index (&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9464-body-mass-index-bmi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt;) – even for people who work out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cholesterol ratio, which blends triglyceride and cholesterol levels to flag cardiovascular risk, and BMI, an estimate of body fat, both climbed with prolonged sitting, signaling potential trouble ahead if habits don’t change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Though unhealthy diet and smoking play a major role in increasing BMI, the full-point jump we saw in the data was just due to sitting alone,” said Ryan Bruellman, lead researcher and doctoral candidate in UCR’s Department of &lt;a href="https://genetics.ucr.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-twin-driven-analysis"&gt;Twin-driven analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large twin-and-sibling project examined how sitting time and exercise intensity relate to these “aging” &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/100-year-old-people-all-share-these-crucial-blood-biomarkers-that-short-lived-people-dont-have/"&gt;biomarkers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample included over a thousand adults, ages 28 to 49, with an average age in the early thirties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group mixed adopted siblings, non-adopted siblings, and both identical and fraternal twins to help separate lifestyle effects from genetics and shared upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, participants reported about 60 hours of sitting each week – roughly 8.6 hours per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men tended to report more vigorous activity and also showed higher BMI and TC/HDL cholesterol levels than women. Sitting time was roughly normally distributed across the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team modeled how BMI and TC/HDL change with age while accounting for sitting time and physical activity intensity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They made a clear distinction between “moderate” activity and “vigorous” activity because a brisk walk does not stress the body like hard running or fast cycling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also used a “co-twin control” approach: comparing one twin directly to their co-twin to reduce genetic and family-environment noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In plain terms, if an identical twin who moves harder and sits less shows better biomarker values than their genetically matched twin, behavior is a plausible contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sitting-and-health-hard-data"&gt;Sitting and health – hard data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More sitting tracked with a drift in the wrong direction over the thirties and forties: higher BMI and a higher TC/HDL ratio. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercising-more-than-recommended-may-greatly-reduce-health-risk-of-early-death-from-any-cause/"&gt;Vigorous activity&lt;/a&gt; was shown to push those levels back to normal ranges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When models accounted for sitting time, people who did around 30 minutes of vigorous exercise per day showed BMI and TC/HDL values similar to those of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-minute-of-short-energy-burst-exercise-every-day-can-add-years-to-your-life/"&gt;sedentary people&lt;/a&gt; who were five to ten years younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twin comparisons reinforced this pattern. In identical and fraternal pairs, the twin who sat less and did more vigorous activity tended to show better TC/HDL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A focused test looked at identical twins who were “discordant,” meaning they differed enough in overall health, sitting times, and vigorous exercise for a fair comparison. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairs were sorted into two styles: “Active Replacers,” who swapped some sitting time for vigorous exercise; and “Active Compensators,” who sat a lot but tried to offset it with more vigorous exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The math defined an “exchange” as replacing each extra hour of weekly sitting with about six minutes of vigorous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-law-of-diminishing-returns"&gt;Law of diminishing returns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed a very clear correlation: less sitting and more vigorous movement was directly linked to a healthier TC/HDL profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits from vigorous activity showed diminishing returns. Moving from almost none to a reasonable &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/small-doses-of-exercise-can-greatly-reduce-dementia-risk/"&gt;daily dose&lt;/a&gt; mattered a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, adding more and more did not keep producing the same improvement in TC/HDL. Vigorous work can compensate for sitting to a point, yet reducing sitting still looked “paramount.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health guidance offers simple guardrails: 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. Intensity definitely matters for certain outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For lipids and metabolic risk, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/six-minutes-of-vigorous-exercise-helps-protect-the-brain-from-aging/"&gt;vigorous minutes&lt;/a&gt; often deliver extra value. Moderate activity still counts; this result highlights where vigorous work seems especially potent for these early biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations-of-biomarkers"&gt;Limitations of biomarkers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all studies, this one had limitations. BMI and TC/HDL are informative, not definitive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were relatively young adults, so we are looking at early warning signs, not clinical disease. This was not a randomized trial; no one assigned people to sit or sprint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twin design, including the “co-twin control” comparison, adds strength beyond typical observational studies, but it cannot prove causation the way a trial can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-reported sitting time can be fuzzy. Wearable devices could sharpen future estimates and help test whether replacing specific chunks of sitting with short, vigorous bouts delivers consistent shifts in TC/HDL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vigorous-exercise-and-prolonged-sitting"&gt;Vigorous exercise and prolonged sitting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, prolonged sitting is much more damaging to human health than scientists had ever imagined, particularly in younger people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This twin-and-sibling study suggests that how much we sit and how hard we move shows up in early risk markers for heart and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-quality-could-be-the-key-to-better-metabolic-health/"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across adults in their late 20s to late 40s, more sitting was linked to higher BMI and a higher total cholesterol-to-HDL ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, regular vigorous activity pushed those numbers in a healthier direction, with roughly 30 minutes a day associated with profiles similar to sedentary people 5-10 years younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study makes it clear: if you sit for long periods, the standard exercise recommendations are not enough,” Bruellman concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All adults, even the younger ones, need to move more, and exercise harder, to counteract the impact of sitting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Break up long sitting spells. Stand more during tasks. Add walking between activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build a routine that includes some vigorous minutes most days – enough to push breathing and heart rate safely for your fitness level. Reducing sitting and adding vigorous movement worked best together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308660#sec017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 01:28:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPRDBUd21vWU5WUXFuc0hkbFllWGV5V2RkTFdCeVdGTWdiS3BzOUEtTUg2TDl2MDhhTXZabVNybzZHX1NuUmlfbGJmd3g4X2gtMTZhUDhZeDQtUnA1bnFRdFVJMEZPTnBSU2pTQXJ4MWQ3eEExd1pndUJ2VVFkNVlfMnJNeEwwVXpPRGE0R1NPckg2bVZXeWlfTGhuaWlaZkdtMjl2dVpVdzBVbDV6TklCTFdR</guid></item><item><title>专家声音报警：与自杀有关的流行脱发药物- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/experts-sound-alarm-popular-hair-loss-drug-linked-to-suicide/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 00:37:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOc21HTHNoTi10R3ZRUndQbGRkeVpjTzBhQ3BvZ0xOMnJWRkFfQmxKa05fd1VwSTVBWjdodGpLQm5jSmlCZFRQOE9xS0dJNjRMYk14YkNyenVNR0V0Vmh6M1B2WUhnbWp4VUs2cTAzR1BIbDR2ZWlZYUFDTENrcVFYUDl3SUZpdW95NG5XOWd1Zw</guid></item><item><title>你是哪个卧铺？新研究揭示了5种主要的睡眠模式以及它们揭示了您的健康状况-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/which-sleeper-are-you-new-study-reveals-5-major-sleep-patterns-and-what-they-reveal-about-your-health/photostory/124468209.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is one of the most vital “non-negotiable” aspects of a healthy life – we all know that. Whether you’re aiming to take care of your heart, preserve your cognitive health, or even in a pursuit to shed some pounds, sleep is one of your most reliable allies. Now, while most advice tells you to “get eight hours,” a new large-scale study suggests that how we sleep may matter just as much as how long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to scientists who studied hundreds of adults using brain scans, sleep journals, and lifestyle data, there are five distinct sleeper profiles — and each comes with its own clues about your mental, physical, and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This revelation is a shift from the one-size-fits-all approach to sleep. It suggests that even two people who sleep the same number of hours might differ drastically in how restorative that sleep is — based on how often they wake, whether they need sleep aids, and how energized (or drowsy) they feel during the day. In short: not all sleepers are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we break down each of the five sleep patterns, explore what they can reveal about your health, and offer ideas on what to do if your sleep type is less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to break the yawn?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 00:32:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>密歇根州东南部的狂犬病蝙蝠咬人- MLive.com</title><link>https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2025/10/rabid-bat-bites-person-in-southeast-michigan.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="L67J2QSAFBD75E5C4HFG5LHPZE"&gt;ST.

&lt;p&gt;Every day, breast cancer upends the lives of countless Americans, subjecting them and their loved ones to unimaginable fear, uncertainty, and heartbreak.  This National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we recognize the resilience and courage of those battling breast cancer—and we reaffirm our commitment to ending this horrific disease once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One in every 8 women in the United States will face breast cancer during their lifetime.  My Administration is determined to end this tragedy.  As part of our historic Make America Healthy Again Commission, we are working to lower cancer rates so that fewer lives, families, and futures will be devastated by cancer’s enduring physical and emotional torment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My Administration urges all Americans to prioritize their health by knowing their family history and other risk factors, using methods of early detection, and implementing preventative protocols and lifestyle changes that may reduce cancer risk. We also commit to the continued prioritization of research and medical advancements that accelerate cures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This month, we rejoice with our Nation’s four million breast cancer survivors, we pray for those who are fighting for remission and healing, and we mourn with all who have lost a precious loved one.  United in purpose, we commit to working towards a healthy, prosperous, and cancer-free American future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most flu patients do not die from the infection, but rather a complication triggered by the disease. The disease can weaken the immune system, raising the risk of someone suffering from sepsis or pneumonia, which can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flu levels are currently 'minimal' nationwide, according to CDC surveillance, but have risen slightly in four states, including North Carolina. Other states with elevated levels are Connecticut, Illinois and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levels of RSV and norovirus are also low nationwide, but Covid levels are 'moderate', according to wastewater surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that as colder weather hits, people will spend more time mixing indoors, allowing respiratory viruses to spread easily between individuals. They say levels are currently low because the nation is in the early stages of the winter virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every year, infections, hospitalizations and deaths from respiratory viruses tend to peak between December and February, before gradually declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, an estimated 40million Americans were infected with the flu, while 400,000 were hospitalized and 25,000 died from complications linked to their infections, in what the CDC called 'one of the worst' flu seasons in over a decade. In that year, cases peaked in early February, before gradually declining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In North Carolina, the state recorded its worst flu season last year since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, registering 544 fatalities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;North Carolina's Department of Health revealed the flu fatality in a press release posted online on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It comes after six counties in California, including Sonoma County (shown above), reimposed their mask mandates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is now urging all residents aged six months and over to ensure they receive a flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also said Covid vaccines were recommended for everyone aged six months and over, even after the Robert F Kennedy-run CDC shifted its guidelines to recommend Covid vaccines to those aged 18 years and older. The agency says parents of children aged six months to 17 years should discuss the benefits of vaccination with their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the CDC shows that in the week to September 20, the latest available, there were eight flu-related deaths recorded nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is outside the start of the 2025 to 2026 flu season, which the CDC says begins in October, but indicates that flu deaths were likely recorded elsewhere in the US this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wake County Director of Nursing, Tina Payton, with Wake County being the North Carolina County for Raleigh, the capital of the state in its central area, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abc11.com/post/flu-death-2025-season-nc-person-dies-related-illness-first-influenza-vax-urged-wake-opens-clinic/17965330/"&gt;ABC11&lt;/a&gt;: 'We see more respiratory illnesses as it gets colder and we're headed into that season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It gives you a chance to build your immunity before the holidays come up, and that's always a big time where people get together indoors and there's a higher opportunity for illness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The news comes after at least six counties in California's Bay Area&lt;span&gt; -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Contra Costa, Santa Clara, Sonoma, Napa, San Mateo and Santa Cruz - reimposed mask mandates in some health care settings. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the North Carolina Department of Health shows the proportion of ED visits due to respiratory viruses over the last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Flu activity remains minimal across much of the US, although it has ticked up slightly in four states, Connecticut, Illinois, North Carolina and Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Starting November 1, each will require health workers and, in some cases, visitors or patients, to wear face coverings in medical settings used by frail, ailing or vulnerable patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mandate in Sonoma County has been set to be renewed every year unless it is repealed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are scant reports of other counties considering face mask mandates at present, although experts say this may shift as cooler weather approaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data for North Carolina shows visits to the state's Emergency Departments for a respiratory disease dropped to 5.4 percent of the total in the week to October 4, the latest available, down from 6.4 percent in the previous seven-day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid-like illnesses, infections that are suspected to be Covid but are not confirmed, were the most common reason for ED visits, behind 1.8 percent in the latest week, followed by flu-like, at 0.6 percent, and RSV-like, at 0.2 percent, with both of these also being infections suspected to be down to these diseases that had not been confirmed via tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The remaining 2.8 percent did not have the type of respiratory virus they were suffering from determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 17:52:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOYVR5azhudXl4aGhvT29EMVdSWXZLQVpoWGZMV3d5OElPbDZ3VXZ1RnpWOUJjdC1ZZ2Q0TjM5RTg4bXJsRVVZZjlVVGxJVzN3VUtlc1R3ZV9xTHBzMTl3S1ExZUtEdjZlaEVwWFNsSlcwcHlSN0tVeGpFczlBX19RZzJFX3NEOHBWNTNFYlFHRy1SQdIBlwFBVV95cUxPV0dnYkp4RDFNcmdGaVRfbzhaSWdHeVlKNXlRQThwOWE1c1pqU25HYU53clp2RFRzOGJaNnlJajdxY3pZUHdCcHdpOTJMVzNSVmZhbmlTZDFZUmsyVWhncS1USTB3dzh6SkdwbHRWTksyT2piaU1CUFB4blRqSk1Gc0Y3eFlKd1dmbW4xaGZiclF3eC13REJj</guid></item><item><title>由于“绝对数字” ，专家发出警报，致命的罕见癌症在年轻人中激增-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15178747/breast-cancer-rising-women-American-Cancer-Society.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists are warning that rates of a rare but highly deadly cancer are on the rise in the US, with cases climbing three times faster than other forms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A key finding from 2012 to 2021 was that the invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), a type of breast cancer, incidence &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13912601/doctors-warn-cancer-rate-rising-young-people.html"&gt;climbed at an average&lt;/a&gt; annual rate of 2.8 percent in women 50 and older and 2.9 percent among women younger than 50.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This rise across age groups exceeds the 0.8 percent increase for all other breast cancers combined. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The period from 2016 to 2021 was most concerning, showing an even sharper annual increase of 3.4 percent. Hormonal and lifestyle factors, not genetics, are the primary drivers behind the rising rates of invasive lobular carcinoma, experts say.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the American Cancer Society reported this week that the steepest rise in lobular breast cancer cases was among Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) women, with an increase of 4.4 percent per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite this rapid increase, white women still have the highest overall case rate with nearly 15 cases per 100,000 women, compared to 11 per 100,000 among Black women and approximately seven per 100,000 among AAPI women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Angela Giaquinto, an associate scientist for cancer surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, said: ‘Although lobular breast cancer accounts for a little over 10 percent of all breast cancers, the sheer number of new diagnoses each year makes this disease important to understand.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lobular form of the disease appears to grow in ways that differ from the other breast cancers, with cells proliferating in dispersed patterns as opposed to forming a lump typical of other cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lobular breast cancer grows differently than other breast cancers. Instead of forming a distinct lump, its cells spread in dispersed patterns. This makes it more difficult to detect through traditional mammograms and physical exams (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The growth pattern of ILC doesn't make it categorically more aggressive in terms of metastasis, but it makes its spread differently, sometimes later, and to unusual locations, which poses unique &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14150127/mammogram-cancer-incurable-Doctors-reveal-harder-spot-stop-happening-YOU.html"&gt;challenges for detection&lt;/a&gt; and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers analyzed national cancer data, comparing invasive lobular breast cancer cases against all other types to track incidence trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using specialized software, they calculated rates and tested for statistical differences in trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also compared patient and tumor characteristics between lobular and ductal cancers and analyzed their ten-year survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While ILC has a similar five-year survival rate to other breast cancers, its long-term outlook is less favorable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ten-year survival rate is lower, largely because ILC has a higher risk of late recurrence and tends to spread to uncommon sites in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For lobular cancer that has spread distantly, the 10-year survival rate is only 12.1 percent compared to 19.6 percent for the more common ductal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lobular breast cancer is becoming more common, and its long-term survival rates are low once it spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to finding that rates of ILC are rising over three times faster than all other breast cancers, its slight survival advantage in the first few years disappears over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Giaquinto said: ‘Also, survival rates beyond seven years are significantly lower for [lobular breast cancer] than the most common type of breast cancer, highlighting the pressing need for prevention and early detection strategies targeting this subtype to be brought to the forefront.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This chart tracks lobular breast cancer diagnosis rates across different racial and ethnic groups in the US from 1975 through 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;White women had the highest rates across every age group, with risk peaking between ages 70-79 before declining&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors conclude that ILC's unique biology, which makes it harder to detect and potentially less responsive to chemotherapy, requires specific research and clinical attention to improve these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior researcher Rebecca Siegel, senior scientific director for cancer surveillance research at the ACS, said: ‘Invasive lobular breast cancer is very understudied, probably because of a very good short-term prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But at 10 years, these women with metastatic disease are half as likely to be alive as their counterparts with ductal cancer, probably because of the unique spread and resistance to therapy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are occurring consistently across all age groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The uniform pattern is notable because ILC is rising at similar rates in both younger and older populations, unlike some other breast cancer types that typically show more variation between age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers pointed to hormonal and lifestyle risk factors as the main drivers of the increasing incidence over genetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ILC is described as being ‘more strongly associated with female hormone exposure’ than other breast cancers, evidenced by a steeper drop in ILC cases when menopausal women’s use of hormone therapy went down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The chart tracks ten-year ILC survival from 2007 to 2021. While early-stage ILC shows better survival, distant-stage disease survival plummets to just 12 percent compared to 20 percent for ductal carcinoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also specifically pointed to the impacts of increasing rates of excess body weight, a younger age at first menstruation and having fewer children or having a first birth at an older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Factors that extend a woman's lifetime exposure to estrogen, such as a later age at menopause, along with increased alcohol consumption in some groups, are also identified as significant contributors to the growing number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research was published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.70061"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, the journal of the American Cancer Society.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Siegel concluded: ‘Our study underscores the need for much more information on lobular cancers across the board, from genetic studies to clinical trial data, so we can improve outcomes for the increasing number of women affected with this cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Later, it can return as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;herpes zoster&lt;/a&gt;, better known as shingles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After recovery from chickenpox, the virus stays latent in the nervous system and can reactivate as immunity wanes with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-study-actually-tested"&gt;What the study actually tested&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Pascal Geldsetzer at &lt;a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, who studies large health datasets to answer practical questions in medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team focused on people who turned 80 in late 2013, because a small birthday difference determined who could get the shingles vaccine that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers call this a natural experiment. It was a real-world situation that mimicked a trial because a rule or cutoff split otherwise similar people into different groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those just old enough to miss the program served as a comparison group for those barely young enough to be eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing near identical birth cohorts, the analysis made it less likely that differences in health habits or clinic access explained the result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That design choice strengthened the case that the shingles vaccine itself mattered for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-drug-helps-protect-memory-in-brain-diseases-like-alzheimers/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a really striking finding,” said Geldsetzer, summarizing the signal they kept seeing across checks and sensitivity analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-shingles-vaccine-lowers-risk-more"&gt;New shingles vaccine lowers risk more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One idea is simple – fewer viral reactivations may mean less inflammation near nerves and blood vessels that serve the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another idea is broader – vaccination can tune immune pathways that influence brain health in ways not limited to one microbe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03201-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; compared the older live vaccine, &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/zostavax/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zostavax&lt;/a&gt;, with the newer recombinant vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/shingrix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Shingrix&lt;/a&gt;. Shingrix was associated with a 17 percent lower risk of dementia than Zostavax. It also had a lower risk than other common adult vaccines in similar age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shingrix includes an adjuvant, a substance that heightens the immune response to a vaccine’s antigen. That extra kick could be one reason the newer shot shows a stronger association with brain outcomes in population data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the Welsh analysis and other large population studies point toward the same conclusion. Shingles vaccination appears to do more than prevent shingles, and the newer recombinant vaccine could be even more effective in lowering &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-particular-sleep-stage-slow-wave-deep-is-most-important-for-preventing-dementia/"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-shingles-vaccines"&gt;What this means for shingles vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zostavax used a weakened form of the virus and is no longer the routine shingles vaccine in many places. Shingrix, which is a recombinant vaccine given in two doses, has replaced it in standard adult schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zostavax and Shingrix both aim to prevent shingles, yet they work differently. Zostavax uses a live, attenuated virus, while Shingrix uses a viral protein plus an adjuvant to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-trick-immune-system-into-stronger-vaccine-response/"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; the immune system more directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practical takeaway is simple. A shingles vaccine remains a tool to prevent shingles. Any added protection for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; is a possible bonus that researchers are still testing, not a reason to treat vaccination as a dementia drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-next-steps"&gt;Limits and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Welsh analysis used routine health records, which can miss or delay diagnoses. The design, however, focused on people born only a week apart around the policy cutoff time, which helps balance many hidden differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biology is not settled. Reduced viral reactivation could be part of the story, and immune training unrelated to the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/first-cases-of-tropical-virus-oropouche-spread-by-mosquito-are-recorded-in-uk/"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; could be another part. Both are testable in future mechanistic studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia affects tens of millions of people. According to a recent WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;factsheet&lt;/a&gt;, there are about 57 million people worldwide living with dementia, with nearly 10 million new cases each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-think-about-risk-and-causality"&gt;How to think about risk and causality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational studies can be skewed if people who get vaccinated also do other healthy things. This project reduced that concern by using an eligibility threshold to compare very similar groups separated by a quirk of policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the cleanest proof comes from randomized trials that assign the shot or a placebo and follow people over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of trial would show whether vaccination delays &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; onset, and by how much, across different ages and risk profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Population level findings are useful for public health decisions. For individuals, the decision to vaccinate should still rest on the proven benefit of preventing shingles and its complications. Any decision should first be discussed with a clinician who knows your medical history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 17:31:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPNnY3YS04V0pHdzhxYjBxTUZTLUdTRkhLaHk3SWlhZEpBUGJQR3NOOVd2TTBKbDF1U0J4NC1tM2JZVDhyUkhIQjFWNEh5a1FwelE0X3BuNkc4RllicFMyZDBVNUR4TTVvYnotWVN0ZnNmS1Bta1JENFBMU0ZtRTVlV2o3T3lITEJsYnRGY3diY3pBTHk4Y2FRZUZEQ0pjbk41N1M5M1pGM0p0MkU2NVI4</guid></item><item><title>我的姻亲对我的孩子非常不负责任。我很害怕，但我丈夫说这没什么大不了的。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/10/parenting-advice-in-laws-alcohol-problem.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkykd2u000l3b78bql0ymmb@published"&gt;I recently discovered what I still can’t believe: My in-laws have been allowing our 15-year-old son, “David,” to drink beer at their house. Apparently, this has been going on for months!&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkyki0p000o3b7860bsu99i@published"&gt;The worst part? My husband, “Walter,” thinks it’s no big deal. He even admitted that &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; parents let him do the same thing at David’s age! His excuse is that it’s “just one beer with dinner” and they’re not letting him get drunk—so it’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="35" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkykjrl000r3b78zac2o0hn@published"&gt;I disagree entirely. I told my in-laws that David—and his younger brother—will not be visiting them for the foreseeable future. Now Walter, his parents, and even David are ganging up on me, claiming I’m overreacting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="120" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkyk6g4000i3b7814enbbz0@published"&gt;You have every right to put your foot down and say that your minor son should not be drinking under any circumstances. However, try to be understanding of your husband’s position; his parents let him drink as a kid and thus, he doesn’t see a problem with it. His family’s position isn’t exactly unique, as there are some folks who think it’s better to let a young person experiment with alcohol at home than to let them discover it on the streets. Explain to him kindly that drinking a beer with family can easily be a gateway to sneaking booze behind your backs and that you do not want to send your son the message that drinking at 15 is OK.&lt;/p&gt;

Let your in-laws know that you are not wavering on your stance, and that your boys can’t visit with them until you have their word that they won’t allow them to drink until they are of age. Tell your sons that your rule may not be fun, but it is designed to keep them alive and from harming others. Everyone can be mad at you if they want, but you know that what you are doing is in your children’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkydfiz000ki0j8yyijt6l7@published"&gt;When I first met my husband, he told me he’d never touched a drink, never smoked, and never taken any sort of drug. He had a family history of addiction, and having seen what it does to people, he decided it probably wasn’t worth it. As someone who never became addicted to alcohol but partied a bit too hard in my early 20s, I really respected that. He never asked that I not drink, though by the time I met him, I wasn’t going out often anyways. Over time, his relationship with his alcoholic mother grew worse until we had to cut her out of our lives entirely, and his sister recently died of a drug overdose. He’s since become a health fanatic. We have three kids between the ages of 13 and 9. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/05/health-obsessed-dad-parenting-advice-from-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;He’s now obsessed with perceived unhealthiness in our family, and it’s doing something really strange to our kids.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it gets worse: Hypertension also increases the risk of dementia and cognitive decline. And heart disease, stroke, and dementia are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm#" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., respectively. Unfortunately, only one-in-four people with a history of high blood pressure have this condition under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In August 2025, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, based on a comprehensive analysis of literature published over the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Conversation U.S. asked &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24559" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain what the new guidelines mean, and how you can work with your doctor to manage your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why did blood pressure guidelines change?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The most recent guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prior to this new statement were in 2017;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;prior to this new statement were in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, the medical community has learned a lot about hypertension and the best way to control it. The new guidelines provide a great deal of new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First, the definition of hypertension has changed: The criteria are more strict, and the target blood pressures are lower than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The criteria depend on the values of the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/which-blood-pressure-number-is-important" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“systolic” and the “diastolic” pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;“systolic” and the “diastolic” pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Systolic blood pressure, the top number, represents the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is squeezing blood into the body. Diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number, is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing. Both numbers are important when determining the severity of hypertension and how it is most appropriately managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new guidelines have removed the category of “prehypertension,” which was defined by a systolic pressure of 120 to 139 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), or a diastolic pressure of 80 to 99 mm Hg. Now, patients are categorized as having “elevated blood pressure” if their blood pressure is 120 to 129 over less than 80 mm Hg, or stage 1 hypertension if they are 130 to 139/80 to 89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A reading of 140/90 or more is considered stage 2 hypertension, and a reading of 180/120 or greater is a hypertensive crisis. In essence, the bar has been lowered, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25466" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this change may impact millions of Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this change may impact millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People need to ask their doctors if they have hypertension based on these new criteria, and whether or not they should be treated. It is also very important for patients to get advice from their doctors about lifestyle habits that they can incorporate into their daily routine, like diet, exercise and healthy sleep habits to help &lt;a href="https://katiecouric.com/health/how-to-lower-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition, the guidelines encourage providers to use a risk calculator, called PREVENT — short for &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS&lt;/a&gt; — to determine a patient’s overall risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure. This tool represents a significant advance in personalizing medical care, since it incorporates risk factors unique to the individual, allowing for a tailored approach to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What’s the link between alcohol intake and high blood pressure?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The guidelines encourage people to limit alcohol intake because alcohol increases blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis of seven studies with nearly 20,000 people showed that systolic blood pressure will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increase by about 1 mm Hg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;increase by about 1 mm Hg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed&lt;/a&gt;. A standard beer contains about 14 grams of alcohol, so regular alcohol consumption may increase blood pressure by several points over time. For people who have been consistently drinking excessive amounts of alcohol but later stop drinking, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.HYP.33.2.653" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:their blood pressure may come back down;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;their blood pressure may come back down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That might not sound like much of an impact, but when combined with other unhealthy and risky behaviors, like sedentary behavior, excessive weight, inadequate sleep, psychological stress, and smoking, the risk factors start to add up quickly. Together, they can very quickly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001303" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new guidelines encourage patients to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt;, compared with the old guidelines. For people who do want to drink alcohol, the new guidelines recommend that men should drink no more than two drinks per day, and women should drink no more than one drink per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What other lifestyle factors did the new report focus on?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize the fact that diet can have a major impact on blood pressure. They recommend that all adults — with or without hypertension — consume less than 2,300 milligrams of salt, or approximately 1 teaspoon, per day, and more ideally, less than 1,500 milligrams per day. For a comparison, the average &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt&lt;/a&gt; per day.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many survey-based studies have been conducted to try to understand how happiness changes over a person's lifetime. While there have been a few different outcomes, the most common has been the U-shaped curve. This pattern indicates that, on average, people are happier at the beginning of adulthood, they experience a dip during midlife (the so-called "midlife crisis"), and happiness then increases again in old age. Yet, other similar studies have reported inconsistent patterns—steady happiness throughout life, steady increases, steady decreases or even inverse U-shapes.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Now, Fabian Kratz and Josef Brüderl from Ludwig the Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, argue that the widely reported U-shape is largely an artifact of methodological biases, instead of a robust empirical pattern. Their study, recently &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/esr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/esr/jcaf038/8262529" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;European Sociological Review&lt;/i&gt;, describes a different pattern, in which happiness declines slowly through adulthood, slightly increases in the early 60s (or the "golden ages"), then declines steeply in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the team sought to find an explanation for the variance among studies in happiness versus age patterns and to determine a set of "best practices" for working with these kinds of studies. They used &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/survey+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;survey data&lt;/a&gt; from the long-term German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), taken from 1984 to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say, "The social sciences have faced a challenge regarding the replication of research findings, raising concerns about the credibility of results. An illustrative case pertains to research on age-related changes in subjective well-being (SWB)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to remedy this problem, they decided to take a different route than their predecessors. "This study aims to demonstrate how insights from the modern causal inference literature can help explain the contradictory findings in this research field. We use these insights to develop a theoretically informed and empirically validated &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/research+design/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;research design&lt;/a&gt;, to which we refer as the 'best-practice design.'"&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their work involves identifying a set of common biases, including things like social desirability, in which participants report higher happiness levels due to societal expectations. Survivorship bias is another common problem in these studies. As people get older, those that are unhappy tend to have more &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/health+issues/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health issues&lt;/a&gt; or may die by suicide, leaving the healthier and happier people to continue filling out surveys, and thus creating the upward happiness trend in late life.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The team also wanted to avoid overcontrol, by not controlling mediators like health or employment. They say, "Overcontrol occurs when analysts control for mediating variables—i.e., variables caused by age that also affect SWB. A growing body of causal inference literature clearly demonstrates that controlling for mediating mechanisms distorts estimates of total causal effects. The rationale is clear: including such variables distorts the causal effect by explaining away part of its mechanism."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove that these biases lead to the results from prior studies, the team also replicated older results using different combinations of biases and what they believe were misspecifications of data. They say the U-shape is a common result of these designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, their improved best-practice design results in the steep decline of happiness after the late-60s. They also find no evidence for the midlife crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overall, our findings do not support the notion of a U-curve, at least not in the sense in which it is often conceived. There is no basis for concluding that people in old age become happier again. Even the small increase during the golden ages can hardly be interpreted as evidence of a U-curve, since SWB remains well below happiness levels in the 20s, and the sharp decline follows immediately. Furthermore, we would argue that the dip in happiness around age 58 can hardly be interpreted as an indication of a midlife crisis, since the decline in happiness is gradual throughout adulthood," the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there is no definitive, objective way to measure happiness. Subjective reports may be unreliable, and even if they are not, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/happiness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;happiness&lt;/a&gt; over a lifetime can also vary by culture and location. The study authors note these limitations, as their data is only based on German surveys. They also note that compositional variables or contextual factors may not be fully captured.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2020, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-6b0305f0-a5d6-11f0-b5dc-0395410c7ef4"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recorded 2,168 cases of congenital syphilis. By 2024, that number rose to 3,941. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the agency, this is the highest number of cases of the disease since 1992. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believe the rise is being driven by lack of access to general medical care and education, as well as by pregnant women not receiving prenatal care and testing and not following up with treatment after testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 40 percent of pregnant women who tested positive did not receive any or adequate treatment, according to new CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cases of congenital syphilis have more than tripled in recent years, with 3,882 cases reported in 2023 (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women’s sexual partners who don’t receive STD screening or treatment also contribute to the rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And many infected people will show no symptoms of the infection.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forty-three percent of birth parents did not receive syphilis testing during their pregnancy and 23 percent were not treated for a positive case. This contributed to almost 90 percent of congenital syphilis cases across the US in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For nine in 10 cases of the STD in infants, testing and treatment during pregnancy might have prevented the transmission of the potentially deadly disease to newborns, Johns Hopkins estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To combat the outbreak, the city of Baltimore awarded Johns Hopkins $225,000 in 2024 to help provide testing and care to at-risk or infected individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Head of Johns Hopkins' Center for Communication Programs August Summers said during the announcement: 'We will be bringing awareness about the issue to Baltimore, both to people who are pregnant and their partners who likely also need treatment, as well as to providers to help improve counseling and testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is a possibility of infant death, and that’s really what we want to prevent above all else.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syphilis is an STD contracted during sex that causes skin rashes and sores &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primary syphilis sores begin at the infection site such as the mouth or genitals. Secondary syphilis rashes appear on the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Congenital syphilis can cause symptoms such as bone deformities, jaundice, rashes and lesions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, both syphilis and congenital syphilis are preventable by using condoms during sex and can be treated by the antibiotic penicillin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When left untreated, the disease can lead to neurological problems, premature and stillbirths, and after-birth death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health agencies have recommendations for syphilis testing, providing self or at-home STD tests to expand the options for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rebecca Dineen, assistant Baltimore health commissioner for maternal and child health, said officials were focused for years on the pandemic, rather than on congenital syphilis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every state recommends a test in the first trimester, 18 states recommend it for the third, and nine recommend it post-birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only eight states mandate syphilis screenings after delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, syphilis rates among African Americans are some of the highest in the US and Baltimore's population is 60 percent African American. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pandemic may have also played a part because health leaders were more focused on Covid than other infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rebecca Dineen, assistant Baltimore health commissioner for maternal and child health, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thebanner.com/community/public-health/congenital-syphilis-babies-sti-mothers-YJVMTFAMPJGMTE4CNYOARG3OXI/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;The Baltimore Banner: 'We went through the pandemic, and our eye was not on congenital syphilis.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC states: 'Increasing rates of syphilis among babies reflect a failure of the US health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Testing for and treating syphilis during pregnancy more than 30 days before delivery can prevent this infection in newborns. Too many people are not being tested and treated early enough during pregnancy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only cure for congenital syphilis is the antibiotic benzathine penicillin, which is administered by injection. However, it is currently facing a worldwide shortage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This pattern differs enough from that of neurotypical adults that a machine learning algorithm was able to accurately classify individuals with ADHD based on these visual traits with over 90 percent accuracy. The same approach was also able to distinguish whether a person with ADHD regularly takes stimulant medication. These findings indicate that ADHD may involve a consistent, underlying difference in how the brain handles brief moments of perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by symptoms such as inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. It affects around 3 to 4 percent of Canadian adults and about 2.6 percent of adults worldwide. While researchers have known for some time that ADHD influences attention, memory, and executive functioning, less is known about how it affects the brain’s handling of incoming sensory information—especially how that processing changes from one moment to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies using brainwave recordings have shown that people with ADHD often display different patterns of electrical activity, particularly in the alpha and theta frequency bands. However, these findings have not always been consistent. To better understand the functional impacts of such oscillations, the researchers behind this new study used a method called random temporal sampling, which allows them to track how efficiently someone processes visual information across tiny slices of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their goal was to explore whether ADHD is associated with a distinct rhythm or timing in visual perception, which could reflect underlying neural oscillations. If such a rhythm exists and is consistent across individuals with ADHD, it could provide a new behavioral marker for identifying the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In light of the relatively high incidence of ADHD, there is surprisingly little that we know about it for sure,” said study author Martin Arguin, a professor of psychology at the University of Montreal and director of &lt;a href="https://www.neurocognitionvisionlab.org/en" target="_blank"&gt;the Neurocognitive Vision Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is especially true of the neural bases of the disorder. My lab had recently brought to maturity the technique of random temporal sampling, which serves to capture temporal variations in perceptual efficiency. Given that these temporal variations can be assumed originate from oscillatory neural activity, we thought that examining ADHD from this perspective might bring a positive contribution to our knowledge of the disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited young adult participants from two colleges in Quebec. A total of 49 people were included in the final analysis: 26 were neurotypical controls and 23 had received a formal ADHD diagnosis. Among those with ADHD, 17 regularly used stimulant medication while six did not. All participants had normal or corrected vision and completed a battery of visual tasks under controlled conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central experiment involved briefly showing participants a series of five-letter French words overlaid with visual noise. The visibility of each word varied rapidly during the 200 milliseconds it appeared on the screen. Participants were asked to read the word aloud, and researchers recorded whether they were correct. The contrast of the noise was continuously adjusted so that each participant would average about 50 percent correct responses, ensuring a balanced challenge across individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What set this experiment apart was how the noise varied. It wasn’t static; instead, the signal-to-noise ratio changed throughout the 200-millisecond window in a pattern composed of multiple sine waves at different frequencies. This random fluctuation allowed researchers to analyze how well participants could extract the word at each moment in time, depending on the frequency of the noise changes. The technique generated what are called classification images—maps showing how efficiently each person processed the visual input at different times and frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing the classification images of those with and without ADHD, the researchers could examine whether there were consistent group differences in the rhythm of visual processing. They then used a machine learning model trained on features extracted from these classification images to see if it could distinguish between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classification images revealed consistent differences in visual processing patterns between participants with ADHD and those without. Although the general structure of visual processing looked similar across both groups, certain frequencies showed marked differences. These included processing oscillations at 5, 10, and 15 cycles per second (Hz), particularly when the noise in the stimulus oscillated at 30 to 40 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The immediate implication of our results is that, in ADHD, there seems to be a systematic divergence in visual function from that of individuals with typical development,” Arguin told PsyPost. “This divergence points to a difference in brain function that has yet to be clearly determined.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these patterns were fed into a machine learning algorithm, it was able to classify individuals as either ADHD or neurotypical with 91.8 percent accuracy, using only about 3 percent of the total features. The sensitivity (the algorithm’s ability to correctly identify ADHD participants) was over 96 percent, while its specificity (the ability to correctly identify neurotypical individuals) was 87 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The literature largely emphasizes the individual differences among persons with ADHD as a potential indicator of varied causes for the disorder,” Arguin said. “Our findings rather indicate that we can actually classify 100% of our participants into their respective group (i.e. ADHD vs typical development) from their individual data patterns pertaining to perceptual oscillations; thereby pointing to a possibly unique cause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This high classification rate in itself was also rather unexpected. However, at the time we carried out the data analyses, we had already completed a similarly designed project comparing perceptual oscillations across young vs elderly participants with normal cognitive functioning (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1323493" target="_blank"&gt;Lévesque &amp;amp; Arguin, 2024&lt;/a&gt;). In that study too, we found an accuracy of 100% in the classification of individual participants into their respective group based on their patterns of perceptual oscillations. This somewhat contributed to raise our expectations for the outcomes of the ADHD study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined whether the algorithm could tell apart individuals with ADHD who were on stimulant medication from those who were not. Despite the small sample size, the model performed well, achieving 91.3 percent accuracy. It was particularly sensitive to identifying those taking medication, with 100 percent accuracy in that subgroup. Only a few features were needed to make this distinction, suggesting that regular medication use has a measurable effect on the timing of visual processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when the researchers directly compared the classification images of medicated and unmedicated participants with ADHD, they did not find statistically significant differences using traditional statistical methods. However, the machine learning approach was able to detect consistent patterns, indicating that the medication status leaves subtle but consistent traces in the visual processing rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, the findings indicate “that there is a particular pattern to perceptual oscillations that seems to uniquely characterize most, if not all, persons with ADHD,” Arguin explained. “This fact suggests that there may be a single atypical brain mechanism underlying ADHD. This is at variance from a large portion of the relevant literature, which seems to assume a variety of potential causes in attempting to account for sometimes significant individual differences among ADHD sufferers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings are promising, the study has some limitations. The sample size was modest, especially for the comparison between medicated and non-medicated ADHD participants. Larger and more diverse samples are needed to confirm the generalizability of the results. The participants were mostly young adults, so it is not yet clear whether similar patterns would be found in older adults or children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that while the classification method was very effective, the specific link between the observed visual processing patterns and underlying neural mechanisms remains unclear. The classification images are thought to reflect brain oscillations, but this assumption has not yet been directly tested using brain imaging techniques. Future studies could combine this behavioral method with electroencephalography or functional MRI to identify the brain regions and networks involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also point out that the task they used—a repetitive word recognition task with limited cognitive flexibility—may have made it especially sensitive to the effects of ADHD and medication. It remains to be seen whether similar processing differences would appear in more complex or varied tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the findings suggest that random temporal sampling may offer a powerful and objective tool for identifying ADHD. The ability to classify individuals with such high accuracy, based on a brief visual task, suggests that there may be a single core difference in perceptual timing that characterizes the condition. This idea stands in contrast to much of the current literature, which tends to emphasize individual differences and multiple potential causes for ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the technique proves reliable in broader populations and under different testing conditions, it could eventually be adapted into a clinical tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on our investigation in adults with ADHD, we are now pursuing a related study to examine whether we can replicate its findings in children in the age range where an assessment for possible ADHD is most often sought (10-14 year olds),” Arguin explained. “If so, it would indicate that random temporal sampling could constitute an excellent test for the assessment of ADHD. Such a test could eventually prove very useful in the current context where: 1. access to the relevant specialists is often very difficult; 2. assessment for possible ADHD may be very costly; 3. the diagnosis of ADHD is based on symptomatology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310605" target="_blank"&gt;Visual processing oscillates differently through time for adults with ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Pénélope Pelland-Goulet, Martin Arguin, Hélène Brisebois, and Nathalie Gosselin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 15:05:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOU2FFY2o2Qi12cWUwcDRPeXYzRk5DeGxTUklkYTl2OHZwSkVFcXJCRnJyX0hiNUw0ZU1EQUpXU1hZdGVDWHBoNG1sT1NJSUhXS3psSGQ1RE1xSEpkTTQ0WVdoQW1vS2ctd3pLNmVWd3Z5bHFwMzJ5cEdVeDFWM1cwbWZhQnc5WlktU3pyazdQMHhiNmE0bS04bTVfNlgyckZZQmUtN2o5Q05Kc3BNQWhGTQ</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家：在治疗心脏病发作20年后，您“付不起钱让我吃”的9种美国食物- MSN</title><link>https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/nutrition/cardiologist-9-american-foods-you-couldn-t-pay-me-to-eat-after-20-years-of-treating-heart-attacks/ar-AA1OdES0</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

With constant overstimulation and minimal relaxation, our bodies amp up cortisol production to deal, which can be harmful when those levels stay elevated over long periods of time. However, while cortisol often gets a bad rap, balanced levels are essential for key functions like metabolism, blood pressure, and more. Fortunately, Ritual’s capsule is a brilliant line of defense against stress—with a special time release capsule that works instantly &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; over the span of four and eight hours respectively, by releasing a special combination of ashwagandha, L-theanine, and saffron to fight stress, which supports balanced cortisol levels overall. “Ashwagandha has been shown to lower cortisol levels, reduce perceived stress and anxiety, and improve sleep quality,” Fazio says. “It may also help with energy, focus, and immune support by working on the same stress pathways.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Shoden Ashwagandha, Suntheanine L-theanine, affron Saffron Extract&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt;

it:&lt;/strong&gt; By reverse-engineering the biology of sleep, the team at Athletic Greens researched the core systems that influence good sleep, including clinically studied nutrients and botanicals that support those tentpoles. “For AGZ, we identified six key systems that impact sleep, and carefully mapped them to ingredients, including the stress system (HPA Axis) which ashwagandha supports,” explains Esposito. “This multisystem approach supports sleep in a 360-degree way through three different phases of rest—calming the body in the evening, improving sleep quality through the night, and helping you wake up feeling more refreshed.” Made with ashwagandha (5% withanolides), saffron, L-theanine, Magtein magnesium L-theronate, and chamomile flower extract, it’s basically a great night’s sleep in a tiny packet. There’s three delicious flavors—mixed berry, chocolate, and chocolate mint—so you’ll find one version tailored to your taste preferences. Use a frother to blend it with four ounces of water or milk (again, your choice) that’s cold, room temperature, or warm. Use one packet right before bed to signal your brain and body that it’s time to begin winding down and doze off to dreamland.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Ashwagandha, saffron, L-theanine, Magtein magnesium L-theronate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Powder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 packet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; NSF-certified, third-party tested&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Emotional Balance:&lt;/strong&gt; Thorne Ashwagandha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we love it:&lt;/strong&gt; With a concentrated dose of the bioactive components of Shoden ashwagandha (both root and leaf), this extract is standardized to 35% withanolide glycosides. “When looking for ashwagandha for sleep or stress support you want to look for one that is standardized to &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;withanolides&lt;/a&gt;,” Esposito says. “These are the active constituents that have been studied for their restorative and rest promoting effects.” Thorne has long been a favorite among doctors and physicians for their transparency and stringent testing, making it an easy choice for anyone looking to support physical, mental, and emotional health. “This option from Thorne is a high-quality, well-tolerated formula that provides standardized ashwagandha in a clean, reliable supplement,” says Fazio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Ashwagandha extract (root, leaf)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Capsule&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; One capsule&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; NSF-certified, third-party tested&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Anxiety:&lt;/strong&gt; Moon Juice Ashwagandha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we love it:&lt;/strong&gt; Known for their incredible adaptogen supplements, Moon Juice has a few different offerings made with ashwagandha, but none are more powerful or potent than this finely milled 100% ashwagandha powder. It’s made with only a single ingredient—an organic, super-concentrated root-only ashwagandha extract called KSM-66—which has shown to reduce levels of &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.4103/0253-7176.106022" target="_blank"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; (the stress hormone) as well as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4270108/" target="_blank"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and restlessness. KSM-66 has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3573577/" target="_blank"&gt;clinically studied&lt;/a&gt; to help manage stress and improve sleep over time. For the best results, take it consistently—its not an overnight one and done. “Most people do not feel an immediate effect but instead build up the benefits over time,” explains Esposito. “I suggest giving it several weeks before assessing the full benefit.”  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Organic KSM-66 ashwagandha&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Powder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1/4–1/2 tsp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; Non-GMO, gluten-free, vegan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Ashwagandha Gummy&lt;/strong&gt;: Gaia Herbs Organic Ashwagandha Gummies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we love it:&lt;/strong&gt; For a plant-powered boost, these organic gummies taste like an apple-cinnamon donut and are naturally sweetened with apple, date, and blueberry extracts. Three gummies is all you need for a 600mg dose of ashwagandha root extract. “The most studied dose is 300–600 mg per day of standardized root extract, taken with food,” says Fazio. “You can take it in the morning for focus and energy, or in the evening to support relaxation and sleep.” And because they’re delicious, it’s easy to keep up with taking them consistently. “Consistency is key to get the best results: Use daily for at least six to eight weeks to see how you feel,” Fazio adds. It is worth noting that there are four grams of added sugars so it may not be the best option for those looking to lower sugar intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Organic ashwagandha root extract, cinnamon bark, ginger&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Gummy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; 3 gummies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; USDA-organic, Non-GMO Project Verified&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Liquid Ashwagandha:&lt;/strong&gt; MaryRuth Organics Ashwagandha Root&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we love it:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have trouble swallowing capsules, a liquid supplement is an excellent option that’s easier and more palatable to take. Formulated with glycerin and water (instead of alcohol), it comes with a brilliant dropper for precise doses. MaryRuth’s has pretty rigorous quality and testing standards, making it a great choice for anyone new to ashwagandha too. “It’s important to choose supplements that come from a vetted brand, that has clinical research, and are third-party-certified,” says Esposito. “This not only confirms the quality of the ingredient but also confirms that it is truly ashwagandha.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Organic ashwagandha root extract&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Liquid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; 0.5 ml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; USDA organic, Non-GMO Project verified, B Corp certified, Clean Label Project certified, cGMP certified&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Ashwagandha Blend:&lt;/strong&gt; Needed Cognitive Support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we love it:&lt;/strong&gt; Made specifically to support women at every life stage, this capsule is research-backed, thoughtfully made, and ideal for those who are feeling depleted with brain fog and fatigue. With 125 mg of the patented ashwagandha complex Sensoril, as well as nootropics like &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-lions-mane-supplement" target="_blank"&gt;lion’s mane&lt;/a&gt; and reishi, it offers full-spectrum support. “In Ayurvedic tradition and now through modern studies, ashwagandha is regarded for reducing stress and anxiety by supporting the nervous system,” says Hemsley. “Modern forms of ashwagandha are capsules and tablets which are convenient, but the traditional way to take herbal remedies is with a carrier such as warm milk, ghee, or unpasteurized honey to enhance absorption.” If you’re looking to take ashwagandha the Ayurvedic way, Hemsley recommends emptying the capsules—which are already precisely dosed—into your preferred “carrier” to meet the Ayurvedic recommendation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Ashwagandha, coffee fruit extract, lion’s mane, reishi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Capsule&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; 2 capsules&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certifications:&lt;/strong&gt; The Climate Label certified, B Corp certified, Clean Label Project certified, certified plastic neutral&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;inline-embed name="faq" attrs="[object Object]" childtypes="callout:accordion" contenttype="callout:faq"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything You Need to Know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hsYVHT jBbAVt"&gt;&lt;div id="whatis" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha is a nightshade plant whose root and leaf are sometimes used to make adaptogenic supplements. “Ashwagandha’s latin name—&lt;em&gt;Withania somnifera&lt;/em&gt;—will hint at exactly what it has been seen to do,” says Esposito. “Somnifera means sleep inducing and is related to the word we use today, somnolence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="benefits" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fhuYhW"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the benefits of ashwagandha?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a wide range of benefits associated with using ashwagandha—some include lowering cortisol levels, supporting lower stress levels and sleep, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4270108/" target="_blank"&gt;combating anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and improving &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471731/" target="_blank"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. “Strong clinical trials show that ashwagandha root extract can significantly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37878284/" target="_blank"&gt;lower stress and anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and improve sleep when taken regularly,” says Fazio. “However, more large-scale and long-term research is still needed.” There’s also some emerging research that shows it could help with energy, focus, and immune support by working on the same stress pathways. On the Ayurvedic front, it can help with seasonal changes in autumn and early winter too. “At this time of year when the seasons are changing, which affects our inner environment, ashwagandha can be particularly useful to strengthen ‘Ojas’ (the vital energy or "life force" that sustains physical and mental health),” says Hemsley. “It’s responsible for immunity, resilience, and vitality.” Some research attributes &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28829155" target="_blank"&gt;improved thyroid function&lt;/a&gt; in patients with hypothyroidism as well as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471731/" target="_blank"&gt;enhanced memory and cognitive improvement&lt;/a&gt; for adults with mild cognitive impairment and people with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="form" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fhuYhW"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What form of ashwagandha is most effective?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple forms of ashwagandha and the impact really depends on what the intent for use is. “When looking for ashwagandha for sleep or stress support, you want to look for one that is standardized to withanolides,” says Esposito. Ashwagandha is rich in phytochemicals, including alkaloids and withanolides—the latter are believed to be responsible for ashwagandha’s effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ashwagandha is well-tolerated by most people, it’s essential to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any supplements—including ashwagandha. “That way you can ask questions about combining it with other medications, specific health concerns, and more,” says Esposito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="how" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fhuYhW"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to take ashwagandha for maximum benefits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most supplements, consistency is key in order to see any real results or benefits from taking ashwagandha. “Most studies show the greatest benefit when ashwagandha supplementation is taken consistently for at least six to eight weeks,” says Fazio. Fazio recommends capsules and tables with standardized root extracts with at least 5% withanolides. “While liquid extracts and gummies may provide convenience, they often vary in potency or absorption,” says Fazio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="howwetested" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we test and review a product, we take a holistic approach to deliver well-rounded product recommendations.

Lost down a dramatic rabbit hole of late-night Google searches, prompted by a headache or pain that just won't quit. One minute, we're calmly checking our symptoms. The next, we're having a panic attack and mentally drawing up our last wishes - convinced we've got a fatal case of some &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/rare-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;rare disease&lt;/a&gt;, and have months, if not days, left to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;Thanks to the internet, it would seem like a medical degree is no longer needed to make a diagnosis. Armed with WebMD, MayoClinic, TikTok, and a false sense of confidence, ordinary "experts" believe they have it all figured out. But often, it's this very determination that leads to hilarious, and sometimes disastrous, results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;Someone once &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;strong&gt;What was the MOST incorrect self-diagnosis you've encountered in your practice?&lt;/strong&gt;" and judging by the answers, the real doctors out there have seen it all… From a patient who was convinced they had a bee in their eye, to another who claimed they'd had 20 heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bored Panda&lt;/strong&gt; has put together a compilation of the best of the worst &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/doctors-dealing-patients-googled-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;self-diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; cases doctors have witnessed.

Symptom checkers, self-diagnosis, and the like are often inaccurate and can even cause bigger problems than the one/s you think you have.

For example, in 2015, over a third of American adults regularly used the internet for self-diagnosis, as &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/checking-symptom-checkers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; the National Institutes of Health.

I've never seen someone so embarrassed, she practically ran out of the ER. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crlczzk/" target="_blank"&gt; Hawkeye1867 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/woman-trying-jeans-in-changing-room-at-factory-BZRQMTL" target="_blank"&gt; astrakanimages/Envato (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-77/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471973"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471973" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/most-incorrect-self-diagnosis-doctors-pactice-1-68e776505ab1e__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Doctor conducting eye exam on woman using medical equipment, illustrating cases of self-diagnosed patients proven wrong." title="Doctor conducting eye exam on woman using medical equipment, illustrating cases of self-diagnosed patients proven wrong." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Optometrist here.

She had floaters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;edit: lots of questions about what floaters are: when the jelly in the back of your eye degenerates down to a liquid you see shadows of the chunks of jelly floating around in the back of your eye.

Hope you won't find this out of place. I had a client come in several years ago with a dog suffering from flea allergy dermatitis. These dogs have an allergy to flea saliva that causes them to get insanely itchy - primarily around the rear end and base of the tail. This poor little guy had chewed his fur out to the point that his back half was just about completely naked. So there he sits scratching and biting at himself, covered in fleas, several of which I have combed off of him and showed his owner. "Good news," I say. "We can fix this." After explaining the diagnosis, his owner proceeded to tell me how foolish I was - the dog was not itchy because of fleas. He was chewing at himself as a psychological response to the disturbance caused by having his butt shaved by an unknown intruder who must have broken into the house while they were away. I had no response to that other than to agree, that, yes, that must have been very traumatic for him. Ultimately we agreed to treat for the fleas, just in case. Shockingly, the dog got better.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crkzvqx/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/a-veterinarian-examines-a-beagle-dog-with-a-stetho-VDF3D6Y" target="_blank"&gt; viktelminova/Envato (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-3/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471956"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471956" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/most-incorrect-self-diagnosis-doctors-pactice-4-68e778c882bb6__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Elderly woman in medical gown consulting a doctor, illustrating common situations of self-diagnosis versus professional diagnosis." title="Elderly woman in medical gown consulting a doctor, illustrating common situations of self-diagnosis versus professional diagnosis." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Just finished med school, so not too much experience, but had an elderly woman come in the ER with new onset seizure.

Her baby had diarrhea for the last few weeks and wasn't going away. She initially wasn't concerned but then her friend told her that diarrhea is the first sign of AIDS and now she was convinced her baby contracted AIDS. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;We quickly ruled that out through their med records and assured her that her baby didn't contract AIDS randomly. As we finished examining the baby it started to cry so we handed it to her mother. Lo and behold she pulls out a baby bottle to get the baby to stop crying....only this baby bottle is red and is filled with Kool-Aid. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;We had to explain to her that babies can't handle sugar at that age and that was the cause of the diarrhea. She refused to believe what we said. "I was raised on Kool-Aid and look at me I'm fine". &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Man the south side of Chicago is a completely different world. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Edit: Another story from that clinic. A lady came in and after she got off the scale she asked what her weight was at. She ~10 pounds heavier than the previous visit and seemed upset. So I asked her what about her weight was bothering her. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;She said she was trying to lose weight but it didn't seem like her diet was working. I casually asked what her diet was thinking she was trying some of the new diets. Her answer was "Bacon". Her friend told her that if she added bacon to all her meals she'd lose weight so she had been eating Bacon 4-5x/day for the last month. She was shocked when she learned that she was doing the exact opposite of what she was supposed to do. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Edit 2: The reason these 2 cases come to mind is because I was shocked by the lack of common knowledge. These people aren't dumb they just didn't know what they were doing was wrong. It's a symptom of poverty and a lack of education. Both patients took the proper step's to correcting their misunderstandings and were admittedly embarrassed. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;As far as the race questions go. I now work in a rural, majority white, part of the midwestern U.S with similar levels of poverty/education as the South Side of Chicago and these patients have the same issues. They just don't know.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crkz7jw/" target="_blank"&gt; DemonEyesKyo &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/stethoscope-folders-desk-medical-office-closeup_419708973.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=35&amp;amp;uuid=276283bf-783a-4046-be2c-f4acec6c1995&amp;amp;query=clinic" target="_blank"&gt; New Africa/Freepik (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-5/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471963"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471963" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/most-incorrect-self-diagnosis-doctors-pactice-8-68e77c1b6b280__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Male doctor examining patient's leg in clinic, illustrating common cases of people self-diagnosing their health issues." title="Male doctor examining patient's leg in clinic, illustrating common cases of people self-diagnosing their health issues." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Self-diagnosis?

I had fallen asleep and forgot to take my contacts out. I wake up and my eyes were really hurting. I go to the bathroom to take out my contacts. I claw at my left eye and eventually manage to remove the lense. I do the same thing to my right eye, clawing at it trying to remove the lense. Eventually I realise there isn't even a contact lense in my eye, so I freak out thinking it had somehow slid up behind my eye. I claw at my eye even more, digging around for my contact lense. I still didn't find it. A few hours later my eye is driving me crazy and hurts like hell. So I get my parents to take me to a walk in clinic. They basically tell me I'm an idiot and that contact lenses can't go behind your eye, and apparently in my sleep I must have scratched it out of my eye. Also I scratched my eye up so bad it got infected and I went blind in that eye for about a week... Everything is fine now, but now I know not to sleep with contact lenses in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TLDR; fell asleep with contact lense in, scratched eye really bad, went blind for a week.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl0ljx/" target="_blank"&gt; GuitarGodGavin &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/irritated-red-bloodshot-human-eye-looking-at-camer-EVFU8C4" target="_blank"&gt; SergioPhotone/Envato (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-32/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Kopp admits that Google should never replace a real doctor's visit. Information gleaned from the internet is only part of the equation, he says, adding that the skill and expertise of the doctor is what matters the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way Google can help is when a patient arrives at their doctor appointment armed with accurate research. "Online medical research can empower people to take control of their health – and help doctors deliver more targeted, more impactful care," Kopp wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9472002"&gt;  &lt;p id="9472002" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Veterinary Technician here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twice I have had people worried that their dog's abdomen was "covered in ticks". Turns out both times to be the nipples. One of them stated someone told them to try to burn the "ticks" off. Another one asked why their male dog had nipples and why they had never seen them before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another one was a guy that brought his 3 year old beautiful spaniel in because he saw "tapeworms all over his rear end". Dog comes in severely lethargic and with a diaper on (dog also had severe diarrhea). When I pulled back the diaper... maggots. Everywhere. He said he googled a picture of tapeworms and that's what it looked like. Uh, no. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dog apparently had a small wound near his rear that got infested with maggots and by putting the diaper on, it only exacerbated the problem. Dog ended up passing later that evening after spending hours removing the maggots, shaving hair, and administering every medication we could. We told the guy next time to not Google things and bring in his pets immediately if there is ever anything that seems off. I think he learned his lesson.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl3f9a/" target="_blank"&gt; pardonmypistola &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-53/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to Google your symptoms, experts say you should be mindful of the words you use.

This is more likely to lead you to accurate medical sites instead of a page that'll take you down the wrong road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, if you have serious concerns about your health, the wisest thing to do is go straight to a real, qualified doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9472011"&gt;  &lt;p id="9472011" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;My friend went to the ER after hours of complaining of feeling something like bugs crawling on his eye.

I took a look. She had breast cancer that was so advanced that it was ulcerating through the skin in an area about the size of a small orange. I'll never forget seeing that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's such a shame because she was such a lovely lady. We talked for about half an hour and during that I found that she had put it down to a lot of stress overwhelming her life lately to do with her son leaving home and a few other things. She seemed like a spiritual lady, and she was so sensitive and overwhelmed at the time that I had to take things very slow with her. During that 30 minutes I really felt that I connected with her and slowly helped her understand what was actually going on and that the next few weeks would be tough with treatments etc.&lt;br&gt;This was about a month after I had started as a junior doctor. The next day I got a complaint to my supervisor by the head nurse for taking too long with a patient, plus a whole lot of other made up stuff about being unprofessional etc to make her claim sound better. Had to go to meetings with management etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, the reason the patient couldn't walk was because of high calcium from metastases all through her bones. I treated that and she was able to walk again a few days later. I looked up her file about three months after and she was still alive, on hormone therapy to slow the cancer's progression.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl2mfx/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/people-waiting-to-visit-doctor-in-front-of-recepti-WEKRS9H" target="_blank"&gt; beautifulmomentstudio23/Envato (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-29/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471985"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471985" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/most-incorrect-self-diagnosis-doctors-pactice-17-68e7a66ea0a67__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Older woman self-diagnosing her illness while consulting a medical professional in a clinical setting about her symptoms." title="Older woman self-diagnosing her illness while consulting a medical professional in a clinical setting about her symptoms." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Not a Dr, but a pharmacist so I hope I'm allowed to play. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patient had a cold, convinced it was "severe sinusitis" (a bit of a known hypochondriac). Saw Dr, got script for antibiotic. Was convinced she was allergic to every antibiotic tried until all that was left was antibiotics which aren't usually used in URTIs at a sub-therapeutic dose (because she's "very sensitive to medications"). The infection wasn't going away so she took antibiotics for longer and longer. She somehow got her hands on a blood glucose machine and must have had a reading that was slightly low one day because all of a sudden she started buying bags and bags of jelly beans because "the infection is making my blood sugar go dangerously low" (fasting ~4mmol/L, so normal). So she is taking more and more glucose (moved onto the straight glucose powder now) to control the "dumping syndrome" (I don't think she even read the Wiki on that one...) that the infection caused. Symptom of her "dumping syndrome": blood glucose dropping rapidly (because she is on a diet consisting of pretty much solely pure glucose) to "dangerous levels" (~4mmol/L). She is testing her blood glucose on average 20 times a day and taking about 250gm of pure glucose at least (from us) plus supplementing with lollies from the supermarket for some variety. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've consulted with the Dr. Nobody can convince her otherwise, we've all tried. She's put on ~15kg in the last month or so and will definitely end up with diabetes soon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr made a mistake the other day. In exasperation she said to her (in her 3rd appointment that month) "You should count yourself lucky, there are people far worse than you that can't even get out of bed". Nek minnit, she now gets deliveries because she is so sick she can't get out of bed...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tl;dr - Lady had a cold is now giving herself diabetes by living on pretty much just simple sugars.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl6t6l/" target="_blank"&gt; Sarcastic_Pharm &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/senior-woman-sneezing-in-tissue-in-pharmacy-H8FRYYW" target="_blank"&gt; gpointstudio/Envato (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-36/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471959"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471959" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Patient is diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, confirmed with biopsy.

Her and her boyfriend had Googled her symptoms, and at 19 you're never wrong. When I suggested that perhaps we check an EBV antibody to rule out mono, she looked at me like I was actively drooling on myself and refused, because there was, "No way I can have mono." Eventually I convinced her to have some diagnostic testing done, and sure enough she had mono. I tried to explain that having oral thrush as a 19 year old could possibly be much more concerning than mononucleosis, but she didn't seem to get it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EDIT: I will give the caveat that if a patient volunteers that they were looking up their symptoms online, I'll always ask them what they think they have and why. This can sometimes give insight to symptoms or concerns they may not have let on about that help me to make a correct diagnosis.

He'd been putting on weight again for a while, and decided to get back into lifting. Gets severe abdominal pain, thinks he tore something. Eventually my sister convinces him to visit his go, who gets him an ultrasound. One look at the ultrasound, and they've got him booked for an MRI that day. Wait here. You shouldn't leave the building. Phones my sister, mostly care free, who then stars freaking out, because she works as a receptionist in a medical clinic. She knows they don't actually fast track you through tests the same day for no reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out the reason he wasn't losing weight again was because of the mass roughly the size of an Aussie rules football on his stomach. Doc orders a biopsy, hopefully it's benign. Doc gets the results, consults cancer specialist, and schedules to take it out in two weeks time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After they get home, cancer doc called them back and says, let's move that up to tomorrow. Turns out it was a really fare form of cancer, that the specialist had to look up the literature on. Extremely fast growing, super rare cancer with a name I can't remember, because it's about twenty letters long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually they remove a 3kg mass, along with part of his stomach. On chemo for a while, and six month check ups for the rest of his life, but otherwise good. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunny side up, it's now real easy for him to lose weight.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl7b2m/" target="_blank"&gt; Tradyk &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-70/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471983"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471983" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/most-incorrect-self-diagnosis-doctors-pactice-15-68e7a51fb8430__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Female doctor using stethoscope to examine male patient, illustrating self-diagnosed health misconceptions corrected by professionals." title="Female doctor using stethoscope to examine male patient, illustrating self-diagnosed health misconceptions corrected by professionals." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Someone thought they had "a strained muscle in their leg" because it locked up and they couldn't bend their knee, then an abscess formed at the top of their leg right at the pelvic bone, and blood/pus started literally *pouring* out, non-stop, for days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually he came to the doctor's office, then straight to the ER, and had an abscess in his psoas muscle caused by a perforation in his small intestine.

Right behind my right eye. They lasted 45 minutes. Tear eyes and stuffy nose ensued. This started when I was eleven and happened every year on the dot. I started going to the doctors and I'd get sinus headache diagnosis. Boom took pills for a month and the headaches would be gone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So every year I'd wait about a month or two into the headaches I'd go to the doctor and get antibiotics. This went on til I was 19 and I remember the headache that changed me. I was watching a movie at the theatres, and boom i get a headache. This headache was like no other, in less than thirty seconds I was in the most excruciating pain I've experienced. Stabbing behind my right eye. Tears flowing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We leave the theatre and I can't even drive. My head is in my hands not moving at all. So agitated. I just want to sit there and snap at any advances of help by my gf. Her trying to rub my back I can't take. I need to be left alone and not thinking. Thinking hurts. It lasts 80 minutes of me crying and just sitting there physically not able to move or comprehend speech because of the focus on pain you have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thenext day I'm driving and get one. I go to a new Dr and tell him "I get sinus headaches , can I get this and this and I'll be happy to go" something like that. So him being a good Dr. takes the time to go through my symptoms and correctly diagnoses me with Cluster headaches. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All I can say is, cluster headaches. Im lucky and usually get mild headaches. I've only encountered 4 or 5 crippling headaches that is unimaginable. Some people get a cripplING headache every day at the same time every day. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl2086/" target="_blank"&gt; twitchy_shemale &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/man-feeling-bad-while-sharing-his-thoughts-with-ps-UM7SWGM" target="_blank"&gt; Zinkevych_D/Envato (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-54/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9472004"&gt;  &lt;p id="9472004" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/most-incorrect-self-diagnosis-doctors-pactice-21-68e7a9cf5387e__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Woman in a control room speaking on the phone, focused on correcting self-diagnosed medical assumptions." title="Woman in a control room speaking on the phone, focused on correcting self-diagnosed medical assumptions." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;911 calltaker. 9/10 times this is what we get.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the best was "MY BABY CAN'T BREATHE!!!! SHE'S DYING AND GASPING! JUST SEND THEM!" .... then proceeds to hang up before I get an address.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily I was already in the process of narrowing down her cell phone by refreshing the signal a few times (leave GPS turned on people!!) so I was 99% certain I had the right house. I start help out that way while I call her back; no answer. So I call the house number we had in previous calls for that address until I get an answer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she answers she's perfectly calm and happy asking who it is. When I tell her it's 911 and we got disconnected (no s**t, she hung up), she flips out screaming that I'm wasting time and sends like 10 insults my way. At this point I'm getting tired of it so I tell her there's more than one person here handling her call and we already have paramedics enroute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this point she tries to hang up again saying her baby isn't breathing. So I get forceful (AKA still polite but very direct) saying we need to start CPR, she says no need because they're pouring water over her to make her breathe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wtf? If she's gasping she's going to inhale the water. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She tries to hang up again and I tell her if she doesn't listen to me then I will make sure the sheriff goes out there (they already were, they respond to most child calls with us) for child endangerment because I'm trying to help save the baby correctly. Now "help me help you".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now she listens and walks into the room where the baby is screaming loudly. "SEE?! SHE'S NOT BREATHING SHE NEEDS WATER OR SOMETHING!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, I've lost all patience. If the child is screaming then they are breathing. If they aren't having difficulty crying then they are breathing fine. This kid was breathing just fine, just angry. I tell her this and she says the magic words:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Lady I'm a CNA, I have no idea what you do but I help people." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Ma'am my training academy to do my job is longer than your CNA training. I don't try to drown people when they cry." And at this point I think I should not have said that...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily the medics made it there by then and she got focused on them. The baby was screaming because they spanked a 3 month old for spitting up.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl6z3n/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/control-room-telephone-and-calling-with-woman-secu-W2E8Z7V" target="_blank"&gt; YuriArcursPeopleimages/Envato (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-55/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471969"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471969" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;**Tl,dr: I think I'm having eye-strain induced headaches. In reality, the bone marrow in 1/3 of my skull had turned necrotic.**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was the summer of 2008. I was at work with a massive headache. I decided to head home early. Thinking my eyes were acting up again. (I'd suffered from severe light sensitivity since I was 12. This wasn't entirely uncommon.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the lobby of the building I pass out as I'm nodding to the security guard. I wake up in the hospital, the doctor is talking with a nurse insisting I get another set of X-rays "There's no way this is right, have a different tech take another set of images." Then he walks out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm asking what's up. No one is explaining anything. I have another set of X-rays done. A bunch of other Scans of which I still don't understand the differences. And eventually the doctor comes in. Still no one has explained anything to me, no matter how much I ask "Wait for the doctor to get back."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally the doctor comes in and tells me they're going to need to prep me for surgery. I immediately ask about my eyes. He seems confused. "Did no one tell you what's going on?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"...umm..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doctor gets all upset "You're missing 1/3 of your skull. Or more appropriately, the bone marrow inside the entire right side of your head is necrotic. It's just sitting there between slivers of bone. When's the last time you've been to the dentist?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I don't know, 10-15 years ago? I was planning on going next month now that I finally have insurance for the first time."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Well we're not sure how it is you're alive. But this has been building for at least 10 years. An abscess in your gums has burrowed up into your bone."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A week later, after a bunch of specialists are consulted, I had my teeth, gums, soft palette, and entire right side of my skull drained of fluid and removed. I was awake through most of it, and no amount of pain medication was enough to deal through the worst of it. Everything was replaced by mostly a plastic polymer, with some metal studs to snap everything together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: My photo-sensitivity issues weren't a related symptom, if you have light sensitivity and get headaches; don't worry. It's normal for photo-sensitive eyes to get headaches in bright light. If you have an abscess though, go to the dentist. No matter how much it costs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl3au0/" target="_blank"&gt; Melachiah &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-20/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471980"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471980" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/most-incorrect-self-diagnosis-doctors-pactice-13-68e7a2ff7db91__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Doctor in blue scrubs with stethoscope, representing medical professionals correcting self-diagnosed health mistakes." title="Doctor in blue scrubs with stethoscope, representing medical professionals correcting self-diagnosed health mistakes." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I'm not a doctor, but a medical translator.

Pregnancy test comes back negative, meantime we work up the history of her experiencing all the classic symptoms of menopause. Anyways, when we tried to explain to her that it was menopause, a natural physiological response to aging in females, she got extremely upset. Requested for a repeat pregnancy test, which we obliged to. Once again, results came back negative. Tried explaining to the patient once more what menopause was, however she told us we were making things up to put it pleasantly. When asked what she thought was wrong, her explanation, in her words were as follows: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) I am pregnant with baby Jesus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) I need to get a new boyfriend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We tried one last time to explain the situation, however she stormed out and never came back.

It hurt, a lot, and so I asked my wife (a former dental assistant) to check it out. She said it looked like an abscessed tooth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went in to the dentist the next day. Another dental assistant (with years of experience) took a look and said, yeah, sure looked like an abscess to her. Too bad, it's a root canal. She took some x-rays and left. I'm feeling pretty bad about it now. I thought I took decent care of my teeth, so this kind of blind sided me. I started mentally preparing myself for seemingly inevitable root canal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dentist came in. He's normally a pretty funny guy, but this time he was pretty serious. He looks at the X-rays, peers in my mouth for about ten seconds, and then stands up and starts elevating my chair. "Seven to ten days." That's all he said. I'm pretty confused at this point. He laughed at my expression and said, "You have one heck of a canker sore, sir. It'll be gone in 7-10 days.

Turns out that at some point in the past, after she was diagnosed with an in-born error of metabolism, her primary care physician prescribed her vitamin B12 injections (your body requires B12 to make hemoglobin).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of going back for refills after she ran out, however, she headed over to her local pharmacy, bought *vitamin B6* tablets, and proceeded to take *two* per day, and went on to explain how, you know doc, it's the same thing!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, no.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl27e7/" target="_blank"&gt; bupivacaine &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-17/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9472012"&gt;  &lt;p id="9472012" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not a doctor (yet), but I work in the ER as a Scribe, so I follow them around all day. We had a lady come in and said "I got crabs". The Doctor asked "have you seen any of them", to which she replies "no, but I can feel them biting me. My husband gave them to me and my kids". At this statement, we were all thinking "what?". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it soon became clear that this lady had no idea what crabs actually are. She ended up having a mild rash and was discharged along with her family, but that was quite an interesting self-diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl2vvi/" target="_blank"&gt; armadilloeater &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-63/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9472049"&gt;  &lt;p id="9472049" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Guy came into ED with occipital headache, talking following directions--thought it was a migrane.

I want to refer her to a retinal specialist to confirm the diagnosis but she refuses because, "it's just allergies and I just need to prescribe her some drops."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I should also add that her eye were not at all tearing, itching, and there was no inflammation of the conjunctiva at all- not that this would cause your vision to drop to 20/80 even if they were present.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl1ig4/" target="_blank"&gt; WillieM96 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-40/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9472008"&gt;  &lt;p id="9472008" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Had a patient who was convinced he had contracted syphilis from "immoral conduct".

    &lt;p&gt;As the autumn’s cool weather settles in, so does flu season – bringing with it the familiar experiences of sniffles, fever and cough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, influenza – the flu – affects millions of people. Most will experience the infection as a mild to moderate illness – but for some, it can be severe, potentially resulting in hospitalization and even death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the start of flu season may feel routine, it’s important to remember that the virus changes every year, making &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html"&gt;annual vaccination an important part of staying healthy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What to expect this flu season&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public health experts are closely watching how this year’s flu season unfolds. Early reports suggest that the U.S. may see &lt;a href="https://www.idse.net/Influenza/Article/10-25/CDC-Classifies-Upcoming-Flu-Season-as-Moderate-but-Vaccination-Still-Key/78478"&gt;a moderate level of flu cases&lt;/a&gt;, partly because &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.17484"&gt;last year’s flu activity was high&lt;/a&gt; and it’s uncommon to have two severe flu seasons in a row. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the U.S. also uses data from the Southern Hemisphere’s earlier flu season, which lasts from April to October, to help predict what the season might look like. There, the flu season has been &lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/worrying-signs-as-peak-flu-season-draws-near"&gt;more severe than in years past&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, that means there could be a significant number of flu cases in the U.S., particularly among &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm"&gt;children, older adults and those with chronic health conditions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year, the flu vaccine is updated to best match the strains of influenza expected to circulate. &lt;a href="https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/articles/antigenic-drift-vs-antigenic-shift-311044"&gt;Because flu viruses mutate frequently&lt;/a&gt;, the effectiveness of the flu vaccine can vary each year. However, even when the match between the seasonal flu and the vaccine that is designed around it isn’t perfect, vaccination remains the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/current-vis/influenza-inactivated.html"&gt;best protection against severe illness&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., all flu vaccines for the 2025-2026 season &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html"&gt;will be trivalent&lt;/a&gt; – which means they are formulated to protect against the three main groups of influenza virus strains. These are an A (H1N1) virus, an A (H3N2) virus and a B/Victoria virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The flu vaccine protects against severe illness from an influenza infection.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine availability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/fda-will-approve-covid-19-vaccine-only-for-older-adults-and-high-risk-groups-a-public-health-expert-explains-the-new-rules-257226"&gt;Recent vaccine policy changes&lt;/a&gt; have created some confusion, particularly around &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-vaccines-with-new-restrictions-potentially-limiting-access-for-healthy-children-264098"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Many people are wondering if getting the flu vaccine has become more complicated. The good news is that flu vaccines remain widely available and accessible. Pharmacies, doctors’ offices, public health clinics and many workplaces are offering the seasonal shot, often at little or no cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2025-2026 flu vaccine is available now. Manufacturers start shipping vaccines doses in July and August to ensure access by September. While public health experts won’t know the exact effectiveness of the flu vaccine until flu season is over, the flu shot usually &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu-vaccination/how-effective-is-the-flu-shot-this-year"&gt;cuts your chances of needing to see a doctor&lt;/a&gt; for the flu by about half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccination helps &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.11.004"&gt;reduce the severity of illness&lt;/a&gt;, the likelihood of hospitalization and the spread of infection within our communities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that you can get the flu shot &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/coadministration.html"&gt;at the same time as other vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, such as the COVID-19 vaccine or the RSV and pneumonia vaccines for older adults, without compromising effectiveness. If you’re unsure which vaccines are right for you, your health care provider or pharmacist can help you decide based on your age and health status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who should get the flu shot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/vaccinations.html"&gt;everyone 6 months and older receive the flu vaccine each year&lt;/a&gt;, with rare exceptions. That aligns with guidelines from other organizations, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2025-073620"&gt;the American Association of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flu vaccine is especially important for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Adults 65 and older&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Children under 5 – and particularly those under 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Pregnant people&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• People with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes or heart disease&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Health care workers and caregivers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re healthy and rarely get sick, getting vaccinated &lt;a href="https://www.renown.org/blog/slow-the-spread-of-the-flu-with-herd-immunity"&gt;protects not only you but also those around you&lt;/a&gt; who may be more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Practical prevention tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to vaccination, everyday actions help reduce the spread of flu and other respiratory viruses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/washyourhands-to-help-prevent-disease/"&gt;Wash your hands frequently&lt;/a&gt; with soap and water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Cover your coughs and sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Stay home if you’re feeling unwell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Consider wearing a mask in crowded indoor spaces during peak flu activity, particularly if you have a cough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though flu season is part of life, serious illness doesn’t have to be. By staying informed, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/when-should-you-get-the-new-covid-19-booster-and-the-flu-shot-now-is-the-right-time-for-both-190826"&gt;getting vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; and practicing healthy habits, everyone can play a role in keeping their communities safe and healthy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t gotten your flu shot yet, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/hcp/acip/index.html"&gt;now’s the time&lt;/a&gt; to protect yourself, and those you care for, this flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

We listen to the A-side, with genetic material made from right-handed nucleotides and proteins composed of left-handed amino acids. Natural life has evolved to only use this configuration. These biomolecules are &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/origin-chiral-biomolecules"&gt;chiral&lt;/a&gt;: they can’t be superimposed on their mirror images. All life uses the same chirality. The hope, and fear, is that the opposite — synthetic life based on left-handed genes and right-handed proteins — exists on the bonus B-side of the record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As &lt;a href="/future-perfect/393048/mirror-life-mirror-bacteria-existential-risk-science-biology-apocalypse"&gt;my former colleague Kelsey Piper explained&lt;/a&gt; back in January, mirror life could represent a whole new way that the world could end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’re at least decades away from being able to create entire mirror cells — that includes bacteria. The technologies that would allow us to do so aren’t yet up to the task. But we’ve &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10628113/"&gt;encountered&lt;/a&gt; mirror biomolecules like right-handed amino acids in nature, and scientists have synthesized mirror enzymes capable of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5470636/#:~:text=Proteins%20composed%20entirely%20of%20unnatural,in%20a%20way%20previously%20unattainable."&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; mirror genes. With the power of chemistry, researchers have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5470636/#:~:text=Proteins%20composed%20entirely%20of%20unnatural,in%20a%20way%20previously%20unattainable."&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; mirror proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These mirror biomolecules are the building blocks of mirror life, but they are not mirror life itself. This distinction is really important, and not only because I’m being pedantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-2327/full"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;last year &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/dec/12/unprecedented-risk-to-life-on-earth-scientists-call-for-halt-on-mirror-life-microbe-research"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/08/31/mirror-life-scientists-push-for-ban/85866520007/"&gt;dramatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/pause-mirror-life/"&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt; after its authors laid out potential catastrophic risks of mirror life. Such risks include the possibility that mirror bacteria would evade our immune systems and lack natural predators, replicating to the point that they threaten to outcompete normal life. The authors concluded that “in the absence of compelling evidence for reassurance, our view is that mirror bacteria and other mirror organisms should not be created.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So if those are the risks, then we definitely shouldn’t pursue the creation of mirror life. Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Well, only if we accept that those &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Something that’s gotten a bit lost in the noise of media coverage is that the 35+ authors — who hail from fields as diverse as ecology, immunology, and synthetic biology — want mirror &lt;em&gt;biomolecule&lt;/em&gt; research to continue. Nearly everyone agrees on that, because mirror biomolecules can offer immense benefits for developing new therapeutics, diagnostics, and studying the biochemistry of life without making new life itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-brief-argument-against-mirror-life" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The (brief) argument against mirror life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But first, let’s get into why the idea of mirror life is so frightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cbs.umn.edu/directory/kate-adamala"&gt;Kate Adamala&lt;/a&gt;, a biochemist building synthetic cells at the University of Minnesota and the lead author of the &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;paper, received a 2019 grant to develop and deploy mirror cells. Upon looking into it further, she decided that the risks far outweighed the benefits, and called for the work to be halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Mirror molecules are safe to make, because unlike mirror bacteria, the molecules don’t replicate, so they don’t pose any risks of spreading uncontrollably,” Adamala told me over email. One of her chief concerns is that normal cells may be unable to recognize mirror cells, because many of our immune mechanisms are based on chirality, or handedness. This could allow mirror cells to “grow unrestrained by the immune system and environmental predators” that keep normal cells in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The collapse of entire ecosystems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The inability to develop robust medical countermeasures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The possibility that mirror bacteria would be completely resistant to predation by other microbes that prey on bacteria and keep their population under control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It’s hard to overstate how severe these risks could be,” Ruslan Medzhitov, an immunologist at Yale University and one of the paper’s co-authors, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/leading-scientists-urge-ban-developing-mirror-image-bacteria"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Science News. “If mirror bacteria were to spread through infected animals and plants, much of the planet’s many environments could be contaminated. …Any exposure to contaminated dust or soil could be fatal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We could see a mass extinction event, an existential threat to multicellular life as we know it. Effective biocontainment, the researchers argue, would be incredibly difficult. If you have the time, it’s worth reading the 299-page &lt;a href="https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:cv716pj4036/Technical%20Report%20on%20Mirror%20Bacteria%20Feasibility%20and%20Risks.pdf"&gt;technical report&lt;/a&gt; that explains how the study authors came to their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That said, mirror life could offer real benefits. Mirror therapeutics, which wouldn’t be recognized by our digestive enzymes, have the potential to last a lot longer in our bodies, opening up new possibilities for the treatment of chronic disease. Right now, we create mirror therapeutics chemically, putting them together atom by atom. Mirror bacteria could do this for us, and at a much greater speed, &lt;a href="https://attheu.utah.edu/health-medicine/mirror-life/"&gt;allowing&lt;/a&gt; us to produce mirror therapeutics en masse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Synthetic biology and synthetic chemistry are relatively small fields, and mirror biology is even smaller. The declarations of a scientific consensus around mirror life may be premature, but a growing number of voices are getting involved in discussions on the possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I want to make it very clear that right now, mirror life is only a possibility. And it might be more distant than we think. &lt;a href="https://www.chem.ubc.ca/david-perrin"&gt;David Perrin&lt;/a&gt;, a synthetic chemist at the University of British Columbia, told me over email that science is nowhere close to creating a living mirror cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;He is also skeptical that mirror bacteria would be toxic to normal life, and believes our immune systems would likely be able to neutralize them after all. Immune responses are complex, and not all rely on handedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The scale of the threat is unclear, because mirror organisms might be hopelessly outcompeted by regular life. By creating a second tree of life, we might create a second evolutionary arms race, with mirror life on the losing side. Mirror organisms might struggle to find food they need to proliferate. Or not — evolution is a funny thing — but at this point there’s no way to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The more I think about this, the more I realize that the real concern ought to be with creating life on this side of the mirror,” Perrin told me. Trying to shut down work on creating mirror life “makes no sense. …What would have happened if we put a total moratorium on researching radioactivity? We wouldn’t know anything about RNA. And we wouldn’t have any radioactive treatments for cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;He thinks that red lines can be drawn — when people come closer to actually generating mirror life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/gigi-kwik-gronvall"&gt;Gigi Gronvall&lt;/a&gt;, an immunologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and biosecurity expert at Johns Hopkins University, told Science News that the paper’s concerns were very theoretical. While she strongly supports the authors’ advocacy for discussion around the issue, she thinks that any proposed funding and research ban “puts the cart before the horse” and could impede research leading to surprising scientific advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We don’t fully understand the risks of mirror life, and we won’t without more research. But this research could be purely &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gch2.202500051"&gt;computational&lt;/a&gt;, allowing us to assess the nature of potential threats without posing real biological risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Creating mirror life could help us &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/why-are-all-proteins-left-handed-new-theory-could-solve-origin-of-life-mystery"&gt;understand&lt;/a&gt; the origins of life and why it evolved in the direction that it did. I’d be lying if I didn’t say that the idea of a second tree of life, side B of the biological recording, is really cool. That’s not to say that we shouldn’t be worried about potential risks here. This is completely new territory, and it might not remain the stuff of science fiction forever. But there is a debate to be had, and more evidence may emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And we really do need these discussions. I’m glad that the Mirror Biology Dialogues Fund is &lt;a href="https://www.mbdialogues.org/events"&gt;hosting&lt;/a&gt; events to facilitate them. It’s unusual to have the opportunity to proactively shape biotech governance well before the technology becomes a real possibility. Certainly, there’s more to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxQQjM5bGhKeVVtdmdnTlZkSWRhNTZFOFdQOUxadm9ka0dSMzJSOFFLOTZSX0RHQVNxbmVaajVuQ1dGaEtnWFRPV003T2pxTjJzZmRacVl0NW5VcS1HczM1eko5VkNnNjQtcDRxYmE2WmEzb0pUemw5ay0xR1RHU0RvdDVuSmdINXB0S1V1S2RqVEF3OEFXdU9tOC1mVzJYaHc</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.的下一个疫苗目标- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/10/10/rfk-vaccine-aluminum-trump-ban</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 12:16:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBkSEgyOWpqSXRCUXJ3el9uTGYtckdNamJMVTFQN1NFekttRlZqWmlKdTZ5c0N0SjFDd0FNTWZOYnpEM212bDEtWmt3a3VreVU0d1hCSG1nNDNVY0llNEFZNmcwN2l2X1FKNmw4bVBhb0M</guid></item><item><title>美国各地的麻疹疫情继续增加病例数- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/health/measles-outbreaks-utah-arizona-south-carolina</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A deadly measles outbreak in Texas &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak-declared-over"&gt;ended in August&lt;/a&gt;, but outbreaks in other parts of the United States continue to add hundreds of new measles cases to this year’s record national total.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00043b6nnvd0clai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been an average of 27 new measles cases reported each week since the end of August, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The annual total – now up to 1,563 cases since January – is the highest by a significant margin since measles was declared eliminated in the US a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk2wqse00003b6qwyafchyu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s a &lt;a href="https://newalbanyohio.org/news/2025/10/confirmed-case-of-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;new outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Ohio, a recent &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles100125.html" target="_blank"&gt;surge&lt;/a&gt; in cases in Minnesota and more than 150 unvaccinated schoolchildren in South Carolina are in quarantine because of an ongoing outbreak there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00053b6nah7gqtko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before this year, the US had recorded only 10 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coca/media/pdfs/2025/COCA-Call-Slides_09.11.25_Combined-FINALV2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;large measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; – defined by the CDC as more than 50 related cases – since reaching elimination status in 2000. But an ongoing outbreak along the border between Arizona and Utah is already the third large outbreak this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00063b6nj94nfg7j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been more than 90 confirmed cases related to the outbreak – at least 59 in Arizona and 36 in Utah, according to state health departments – and case counts continue to grow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00073b6n46rmcqik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist in Utah, said there is still a lot of opportunity for measles to continue to spread in the area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00083b6ncg2sv3sz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, I think we still have quite a while to go with infections. We know that most of our infections have been localized down towards the southern end of our state, but I think we are starting to see now people get infected even at the very north end of our state,” she said. “So I do think that this is going to continue to bop around and spread in different communities. I suspect we’re in the middle of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00093b6n10jfaug5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say that any amount of measles spread is cause for concern, and large outbreaks highlight the dangers of declining vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000a3b6nlu1h1mqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you have multiple cases happening, particularly with those numbers, it’s only possible because you have susceptible individuals,” said Dr. Scott Harris, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000b3b6n688f1ofb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are measles cases in the US every year, often introduced via international travel, Harris said. But those cases can really multiply only if they’re happening among other people who are unvaccinated – and can multiply at large scale only if large parts of a community are unvaccinated. The Texas outbreak is evidence of this, he said, with state health department &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; showing that 97% of its cases were among people who had not gotten one or both of the recommended two vaccine doses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000c3b6njfq9do4u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The story here is: Parents of young children are skeptical about vaccination,” Harris said. “There are lots of reasons why, but if that weren’t the case, this wouldn’t be a story, because we wouldn’t have these outbreaks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000d3b6nqo077tda@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A record share of US kindergartners had an exemption for a required vaccination in the last school year, and coverage for all reported vaccines – including the measles vaccine – continued on a downward trend, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk0lj6q00073b6qkahyoz2b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coverage with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine dropped to 92.5%, the latest data shows. Because measles is such a highly contagious disease, public health experts say that at least 95% MMR coverage is needed to prevent spread. Last year marks the fifth year in a row that coverage has been below that target.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgkqhkbe00003b6niazx1wvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Utah, Nolen says that public health officials have a good grasp on where measles is spreading thanks to wastewater monitoring that can capture virus levels beyond official case counts, and where the risk is elevated due to low vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgkqowk600063b6n86q7r31d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In those areas, we try to work with the local health department and the community to get the word out that we know that there is measles in their area and that we really encourage families to consider getting vaccines,” she said. Misinformation has created some vaccine hesitancy, she said, but vaccination rates have ticked up as awareness about the current outbreak has grown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000e3b6nfk2w2ta5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A separate ongoing outbreak in South Carolina also threatens to grow quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000f3b6nfvnzppuo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 150 unvaccinated children are in quarantine after measles exposures at two schools in the northern part of the state, one public elementary school and one public charter school in Spartanburg County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000g3b6n9gi39iyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those schools are following the protocols to exclude these students until the period of potential disease transmission has safely ended,” Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist, said Thursday. “Those students are identified as having been exposed and not having been vaccinated, and that’s the reason for the exclusion.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000h3b6n7tgrk0ld@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 90% of people who have been exposed to measles and do not have immune protection from vaccination could get infected, Bell said, and “worst-case scenario” would be that rate of infection among the at-risk students who are being closely monitored for symptoms while in quarantine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000i3b6nm2ilcov6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been 11 confirmed measles cases in South Carolina this year, including seven associated with the Spartanburg County outbreak since September 25, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdph.sc.gov%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Finfectious-diseases%2Fviruses-parasites-bacterial-infections%2Fmeasles-rubeola%2F2025&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeidre.McPhillips%40cnn.com%7Ccf54477b5bb445823b7108de076c3305%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638956358682558291%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=SKMKDLZxmtHJsEinaRbgQpFMfnUegLGeorSRI9Uvpgk%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;according to the state health department&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000j3b6nt177sdu0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spartanburg County has one of the lowest school vaccination rates in the state, according to &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdph.sc.gov%2Fhealth-wellness%2Fchild-teen-health%2Fschool-vaccination-coverage-data%2Fschool-vaccination-coverage-and&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeidre.McPhillips%40cnn.com%7Ccf54477b5bb445823b7108de076c3305%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638956358682582140%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=qgZ8%2FHacZhsiUkvcIbGmx2FOA4QM%2FSkkgllcqI%2B7dlw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department. Last school year, less than 90% of school students there received their required immunizations, which includes two doses of the MMR vaccine. School vaccination coverage has been falling in Spartanburg County for years, as it has across the state and nationwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000k3b6nuyecv3fk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A measles case reported Thursday in Greenville County, South Carolina’s most populous county, is being investigated for a possible link to the Spartanburg outbreak. But the state health department is not aware of any other potentially related cases in other states or jurisdictions, Bell said Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000l3b6nb43ydux3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s “incredibly expensive and demanding” for local health departments to respond to measles threats, said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The organization has worked with health departments from across the country to help them learn from their experiences responding to measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000m3b6n8jblw2io@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Health departments are already stretched thin by budget constraints and staff attrition. Adding measles outbreaks to their workload is draining the reserves of even the best-resourced departments,” Rivers said. “It’s been hard to understand from the outside what supports the federal government is offering to local responders.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000n3b6n0l3t04qp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC has continued to update its measles tracker during the federal government shutdown, even as other surveillance data systems have come to a halt. And local health leaders say they have continued to stay in contact with CDC experts, although they have been warned that response times may be a bit slower.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000o3b6nf75iv9yj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Due to a lapse in federal funding, CDC has developed an orderly shutdown plan, ensuring critical public health and safety functions continue without interruption. As found in the plan, CDC and [the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry] would collect data being reported by states, hospitals, and others, and report out critical information needed for state and local health authorities and providers to track, prevent and treat diseases,” according to a statement from the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000p3b6nzvf2h6s5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But federal surveillance systems are far from perfect, and experts say that formally reported measles cases in the US are probably a significant undercount, with some estimating that this year’s total could be closer to 5,000 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000q3b6ndkruzg2t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Current measles outbreak trends are “consistent with an undervaccinated population,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has exacerbated problems with both disease surveillance and vaccination rates, he said, by cutting federal health agency workers and failing to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment"&gt;fully endorse&lt;/a&gt; the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000r3b6nvloqs722@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re in the midst of a measles epidemic,” Offit said. “We should have an administration that stands up clearly and definitively and holds press conferences saying, ‘Vaccinate your children. These are preventable illnesses.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk0uubm00003b6qhkfvzpga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000t3b6njojkbq7c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trust in federal health leadership has suffered under Kennedy, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/rfk-approval-cdc-trust-vaccines-kff"&gt;a new poll shows&lt;/a&gt;, with most US adults saying they disapprove of the way he’s handled vaccine policy and his role as health secretary overall.
    &lt;/p&gt;
