    &lt;p&gt;When Maria Branyas Morera &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maria-branyas-morera-worlds-oldest-living-person-spain-dies-117/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;died last year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at 117 years and 168 days old, she was the oldest known person in the world. Before she died, she asked doctors to study her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Manel Esteller, chairman of Genetics at the University of Barcelona's School of Medicine, spent three years analyzing Branyas' health. A &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00441-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published online Wednesday, by Esteller and a cohort of colleagues found that a mix of factors contributed to Branyas' longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The conclusion is that the clues for extreme longevity are a mix between what we inherited from our parents and what we do in our lives," Esteller said. "And this mix, the percentage depends, but it can be ... half and half."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branyas "had very good genes that protect against many disorders, many genetic variants that nobody has seen before," Esteller said. She also had "very good habits." She didn't smoke or drink alcohol, and had a diet rich in fish, olive oil and yogurt — eating three yogurts each day, according to Esteller.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yogurt was plain without added sugar, which replenishes the gut with good bacteria, helping to combat inflammation, Esteller said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is one of the main causes of aging and disease, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are good bacteria that provide an advantage to humans," Esteller added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study noted that "whether the dominance of the &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; [beneficial gut bacteria] related genus is fully attributable or not to the yogurt diet cannot be completely confirmed since that would have required a longitudinal study with sample collection over several years. However, we believe that it is likely that a beneficial effect of yogurt ingestion via modulation of the gut ecosystem could have contributed to her well-being and advanced age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branyas once &lt;a href="https://x.com/MariaBranyas112/status/1601512836932390914/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;posted on social media&lt;/a&gt; about her love for yogurt, saying it "gives life" — and hers was a long one. She was born in 1907 in San Francisco and had lived in Spain since she was 8. She survived two world wars and two pandemics, and had three children and 13 great-grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to living a long life, she also lived a healthy one — free of cancer, cardiovascular disease or dementia, according to Esteller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture that emerges from studying Branyas "shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked and that both processes can be distinguished and dissected at the molecular level," the study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00441-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine,&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers said that to conduct the study, "samples from the subject were obtained from four different sources: total peripheral blood, saliva, urine, and stool at different times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also noted some limitations, including that aging and extreme longevity "are probably highly individualized processes," so "drawing broadly applicable conclusions from a single subject should be taken with caution." &lt;/p&gt;

The condition is typically asymptomatic, and people may live with it for years without knowing, until it turns into full-blown diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people with prediabetes, doctors recommend foods that cause a slow, steady rise in blood sugar rather than a rapid spike, including whole, unprocessed foods over packaged and sugary items. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a new study is turning that advice on its head, with scientists concluding that high-sugar fruits may actually be the key to reversing prediabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tropical fruits contain between 10 to 50 grams of sugar, making them foods that people concerned about blood glucose &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14584073/artificial-ingredients-food-drinks-organ-working-properly.html"&gt;try to avoid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But clinical nutrition researcher Raedeh Basiri said that mangos, despite having high levels of natural sugar, may offer protective factors for adults with prediabetes. People in the latest study who ate a daily mango showed improved blood glucose control, enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mango also contains a wealth of vitamins, including A, C, B6 and E, plus key minerals like potassium and copper and more than five grams of fiber, a key nutrient that slows the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. This prevents rapid spikes in blood glucose, which can, over time, cause type 2 diabetes, suffered by 37million Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sugar content is not the only factor in picking the right foods. Fiber and vitamin content &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14775847/Doctors-plant-diet-heart-disease-Type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;are just as important&lt;/a&gt;, and Basiri said in a statement: ‘Individuals at high risk of diabetes should not only focus on the sugar content of foods, but on how sugars are delivered.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Though tropical fruits are often avoided for their sugar, researcher Raedeh Basiri suggests mangoes could have protective factors for those with prediabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Basiri conducted the first long-term clinical trial to show the tropical fruit’s positive effects on metabolism and lean body mass, despite its high sugar content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from Florida, Nevada and Virginia recruited 24 adults aged 50 to 70 with prediabetes. They were screened to exclude factors that could skew the results, such as existing diabetes, specific diets, or being a frequent mango eater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were then randomly assigned to one of two groups for 24 weeks. One group ate 300 grams of fresh mango, equivalent to one whole fruit, with about 32 grams of sugar daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The control ate a granola bar with about 11 grams of sugar and the same number of calories every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the beginning of the study and at weeks six, 12 and 24, the researchers measured blood sugar and insulin levels, insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also measured people's body fat percentage, the total weight of everything in their body that is not fat and the total amount of water contained within their body. They kept track of people’s body weight, BMI and waist-to-hip ratio as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the study tracked their daily intake of either mango or granola bars. The data were then analyzed to compare the changes over time between the two groups, controlling for baseline differences in characteristics such as sex and race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The data revealed compelling evidence for the benefits of daily mango consumption in adults with prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most significant signs that health was improving were observed in people in the mango group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their fasting blood glucose levels decreased, while the control group's levels increased, resulting in the mango group showing a clinically significant 18.3 mg/dL improvement by the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mango group's fasting blood glucose decreased to 107.0 mg/dL, while the control group's increased to 125.3 mg/dL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The normal range for fasting blood sugar is 70 to 99 mg/dL.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The marker for long-term blood sugar regulation in the mango remained stable but rose in the control group, proving that a daily mango exerted a protective effect against worsening blood sugar regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits also extended to people’s body composition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who ate mangoes showed decreased body fat percentage from about 31 percent to 29 percent, a relative reduction of nearly five percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, the group that ate mangoes experienced a significant increase in fat-free mass, which is vital for a healthy metabolism, because muscle is a primary site for the disposal of blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After 24 weeks, the mango group's (blue) fasting blood glucose decreased to 107.0 mg/dL, while the control group's (orange) level increased to 125.3 mg/dL, a clinically significant difference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph shows changes in people's waist-hip ratio at the start of the study and over the course of 24 weeks. The group consuming mango (blue) daily saw a significant decrease in their waist-to-hip ratio, a key indicator of health risk. In contrast, the control group (orange) experienced a significant increase in their ratio over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The control group showed no significant improvements in either marker, suggesting that incorporating a daily mango can be a practical dietary strategy for enhancing metabolic health and body composition in people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/14/17/2971"&gt;Foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Basiri said: ‘It is not just the sugar content that matters, but the overall food context that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The goal is to encourage people to include whole fruits, like mango, as part of healthy eating behaviors and practical dietary strategies for diabetes prevention.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preventing prediabetes primarily involves adopting sustainable lifestyle habits that improve how your body uses insulin and manages blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Key strategies include focusing on a balanced diet rich in fiber from vegetables, fruits and whole grains while limiting processed foods and sugary drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular physical activity is crucial. Experts say aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise, like brisk walking, per week to help muscles use glucose more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, maintaining a healthy weight, getting adequate sleep and managing stress levels are key for preserving metabolic health and significantly reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 18:25:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQWDhCaks2X2FsNTQxQWpUamFKVmY4S3BJVXBxQ3BKWnV5cWcwNGJzdUY0cWNjNkpNM1loSmdEUHc5RWN3Z1VWMzJIME1iSEZkWWhnSTZwbHE2M1Jza0xSZTg0RmxzVWxlVTFxZHJfUmhxWGIyYTNCeGswXy11MmVjSEo4RmNubjAyTVZySnBDcnVveVQwbWRwd29SekhoQdIBowFBVV95cUxOLTNBRDdMTHZGOXRPWjFZSVJ3ZnFOOVNTOGdBZ3pTT3p6M3hZd1lOVy1qTENXZUIyalVad2doVEF1R3BfLTQ3aXZsaTEtSGt3ai1zMjBiNS1XMkZvVENnWG5JTnlrbU82YlVfLTVlelo2TDg5c1M2WFRtSXA2NDdUbElWMHI4MnpwMlNOWm9UYWY3WE5pd3pCUFQyWXFvSTJ0R0Fz</guid></item><item><title>我的父母带着我的孩子过夜旅行-包括航班！ -未经我们许可-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/09/parenting-advice-grandparents-disrespect-boundaries.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

Apparently my parents decided to surprise the boys. They had the trip in the works since we asked them to watch the boys—&lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; clearing it with my wife and me.&lt;/p&gt;

My parents said they’d be back Sunday evening, and then pretended their battery was dying and ended the call. We didn’t hear from them again until they were ready to board the plane the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

While I realize my parents should have consulted us about going on the trip with the kids, I really think this is an overreaction. The kids had the time of their lives. Neither of them have any medical issues that would preclude a spur of the moment trip, and my parents are two caring, responsible adults. How can I convince my wife that going nuclear is not the answer?&lt;/p&gt;

I get why she’s mad, and also why whatever faith she might have had in your parents has been shaken.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputck000q3b79qv4xuql5@published"&gt;Let’s review the facts: Your parents took your children on a flight and an overnight trip without your knowledge or consent. And then, when they were told to bring the kids back that same day, they refused, made up a lie about their phone battery, and presumably didn’t contact or take any further calls from you, &lt;em&gt;your children’s parents&lt;/em&gt;, until they were about to fly home the next day. To top it off, it sounds like they have not apologized and don’t believe they did anything wrong…which means they would probably feel justified in doing something like this again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputf0000r3b79mta1lg04@published"&gt;Some people would say there’s a word for taking someone else’s children from home without their parents’ knowledge or permission, and then refusing to bring them back when they were told to! Of course I’m not saying that your parents had malicious intentions, or that your kids were ever in danger. Nor am I saying they need to be cut off forever. But when you kind of dismiss your wife’s anger by saying that your children had fun—I mean, that’s nice, I guess, but the amount of fun had by anyone is not even remotely the point.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputo2000s3b79fr7klama@published"&gt;This incident has shown that you and your wife cannot trust your parents to 1) go through the (required and extremely basic!) process of informing you of what they plan to do with your &lt;em&gt;minor children &lt;/em&gt;and getting your permission to do things like keep them overnight or bring them on a flight somewhere, or 2) listen and actually do what you ask where your children are concerned. I see how those things would be dealbreakers for some, especially if this wasn’t a one-time thing, but just the latest and wildest way your parents have shown their disrespect for you, your wife, and your authority as parents. And it sounds like this &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; part of a larger pattern—you said yourself that your parents have a history of not respecting the boundaries you and Mia put in place.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputr5000t3b797ksgjtpa@published"&gt;(I have just reread your letter and noted that your parents &lt;em&gt;were planning this all along&lt;/em&gt; and chose not to read you in. It was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a fun, spontaneous decision they made without telling you, which still would have been weird; they made their plan, bought the tickets, reserved a hotel, and then chose to deceive you about it every moment leading up to the trip. ABSOLUTELY WILD BEHAVIOR. Like, did they &lt;em&gt;both &lt;/em&gt;think this was normal? I’m actually kind of worried about them, if so.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpuu4g000u3b79m7mbbd9b@published"&gt;Maybe your wife is saying that she doesn’t want your parents to have access to your kids because she really doesn’t feel like she can currently trust them. If you and Mia tell them to do X or don’t do Y with the kids, Mia doesn’t know whether they’ll listen. Maybe she’s really pissed and just doesn’t want to see them for a good long while—honestly, that makes sense to me, too.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="168" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpuu8m000v3b79v6e3jk25@published"&gt;Instead of telling your wife that she’s overreacting, or trying to talk her out of how she feels, listen to what she’s saying and try to understand where she’s coming from. Acknowledge that what your parents did was unacceptable, and that Mia has a right to be upset. After that, perhaps the two of you can eventually get to a point where you can discuss ways your parents might see the kids, under conditions you both can live with (e.g.: visits at your house with at least one parent present, after a break/cooldown period, if your parents promise that nothing like this will never happen again?). Mia might really need some time before she can consider this, or see your parents herself, so try to respect that. The point is that it shouldn’t be you against your wife, or you and your parents against your wife. It should be you and Mia acknowledging what your parents did wrong, acknowledging the other person’s feelings, and trying to problem-solve together.&lt;/p&gt;

If you can’t even trust them to do what you ask regarding your kids or run things like &lt;em&gt;plane trips&lt;/em&gt; by you first, they can’t be your go-to caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfznjft3000l8mm6873zkixv@published"&gt;My daughter, an eighth-grader, is a doodler. She doodles while thinking, doodles while writing, doodles while doing homework. So when she turns in, say, her math, in addition to the various correct and incorrect answers, the sheet of paper often features medieval illuminations and little anime characters in the margins. I think it helps her think and stay focused on her work. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/10/ask-a-teacher-doodling-and-distraction-in-the-classroom.html"&gt;One of her teachers, however, keeps writing YOUR HOMEWORK IS NOT A DOODLE PAD and threatening to take away points.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

During the 2024-25 flu season, 109 children were diagnosed with the rare complication, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/" target="_blank"&gt;new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fe378" class="body-graf"&gt;The finding comes as the nation logged &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/week-37.html" target="_blank"&gt;280 pediatric flu deaths last year&lt;/a&gt;, the deadliest ever aside from the 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic, as well as falling rates of children vaccinated against influenza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b2f39b" class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t always know how to predict which kids are going to have the most severe forms of flu, which is why we recommend the vaccine for everyone,” said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. “It's a misnomer to think that only sickly kids get complications from the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-42e698" class="body-graf"&gt;ANE is rare — just a handful of cases each year — and has never been formally tracked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8e9697" class="body-graf"&gt;This year, however, doctors anecdotally noted an uptick in kids severely affected with brain inflammation after having the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-741fb3" class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t know in real numbers if this is an increase, but I will tell you, being on the ground, being a physician who cares for these patients, I was certainly struck that this was an increase,” said Dr. Molly Wilson-Murphy, a pediatric neurologist at Boston Children’s Hospital. She is also an author of the new study published by the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-dea652" class="body-heading"&gt;Dangerous complications from the flu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-93ffcb" class="body-graf"&gt;The 109 children tallied in the research were all diagnosed with influenza-associated encephalopathy, or IAE. It occurs when the influenza virus attacks the child’s nervous system. Kids can have a spectrum of symptoms: confusion, difficulty walking, hallucinations, abnormal movements and seizures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5e00b0" class="body-graf"&gt;Wilson-Murphy suspects there are at least seven forms of IAE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d88c64" class="body-graf"&gt;ANE, Beckett’s illness, is one of them. ANE accounted for about a third of the overall IAE cases in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1dc51b" class="body-graf"&gt;Of the children with influenza-associated encephalopathy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-e8ca04" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;74% were admitted to the intensive care unit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;54% were put on a ventilator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;55% were previously healthy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;19% died&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5caad4" class="body-graf"&gt;“Flu is dangerous for children, period,” said Dr. Keith Van Haren, a co-author of the study and a pediatric neurologist at Stanford Medicine in Palo Alto, California. “That is not a mischaracterization.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3bb699" class="body-heading"&gt;Childhood flu vaccine rates are falling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ec7bd5" class="body-graf"&gt;Seasonal flu shots are notoriously subpar when it comes to preventing flu infections, compared with more robust vaccines like the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbe579" class="body-graf"&gt;But doctors say the shot’s benefit lies in its ability to reduce the chance the infection will lead to severe complications and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57bf40" class="body-graf"&gt;“Our goal as parents and doctors is to keep kids healthy and to help protect kids who are at risk from getting sicker,” Van Haren said. “Vaccination against the flu is the purest, best, simplest way to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-386e26" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, the flu shot was found to be up to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_w" target="_blank"&gt;78% effective&lt;/a&gt; in keeping kids and teens with the flu out of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-01f7af" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the new report, 84% of kids with influenza-associated encephalopathy whose vaccination status was known weren’t vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ded252" class="body-graf"&gt;And 90% of the 280 children who died last flu season hadn’t received their annual flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-579a03" class="body-graf"&gt;“The best way to protect yourself and your family from influenza is for everyone to get vaccinated,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, an infectious diseases expert with the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d9b60" class="body-graf"&gt;Pediatricians generally recommend kids get their flu shots before the end of October. A peek at how the shot has been working so far in the Southern Hemisphere’s flu season shows the vaccine is cutting down on flu-related hospitalizations by half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7c5b1" class="body-graf"&gt;But the percentage of kids getting their flu shots has been falling in recent years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f76663" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the CDC, fewer than half of kids (49.2%) had their flu shot last year, down from 62.4% in the 2019-20 flu season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44beda" class="body-graf"&gt;O’Leary said that reasons for the decline are complex. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/data-investigation-childhood-vaccination-rates-are-backsliding-us-rcna228876" target="_blank"&gt;Increasing vaccine hesitancy&lt;/a&gt; is just one factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5465e0" class="body-graf"&gt;“A lot of families are experiencing access to care issues,” he said. “And a lot of practices are experiencing significant staffing issues. They might not be able to have large flu clinics after hours or on  Saturdays.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccb0f5" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;With rare exceptions, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 17:59:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQX1hjNXp1MEpGUlM5Z2p0eEh5Zm5jM3Vpa1BidGpGZHkwdzRwMHVIam91UlU5bzRUVU9lenhwdVhZckpEMmhhTHJ4TExBRS05bXhqZjdvMlpfcVFTbFRoVVNvSlQyQ0NVN21wTURRcEl1OWZnXzc5ejlHN0dBNnc4TjhwSnI4T1JFcDYzV3d1bzIwTHRHTGl3Nkgwb0dFXzZF0gFWQVVfeXFMUEhQWnlSTHhyVXpRMmt4Q2pOWGZjeW5fQ1ZGODYwclRDUzhEbW9vMHAtdWJSZWduX2Jhd0dGUTV1QzBrdGptZURRc3lzb1EwQkJuNkZJbEE</guid></item><item><title>电子烟对牙齿和口腔健康有什么影响？ -卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/25/impact-vaping-teeth-oral-health-decay</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.QAndAExplainerBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-smoking-bad-for-teeth" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;Is smoking bad for teeth?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A hefty proportion of vapers are former smokers or smoke as well as vape, so the first port of call is the impact of smoking. Humans started smoking long before modern science and there is a wealth of robust evidence on its health effects. The message is clear: smoking is extremely damaging to oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beyond the bad breath, brown stains and loss of taste, tar and toxins in tobacco smoke increase the risk of gum disease. In severe cases, this can cause teeth to fall out. The disease can be harder to spot in smokers though, because nicotine reduces blood flow in the gums. This makes them less likely to bleed, which is one of the early warning signs of disease. Smokers may also struggle to overcome gum disease because of the continued onslaught of smoke and the effect smoking has on the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smoking causes more than a dozen types of cancer throughout the body and more than half of mouth cancers are linked to the habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-vaping" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What about vaping?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The impact of vaping on teeth and oral health is still being thrashed out. Far fewer studies have looked at the issue and many that have are flawed. A common problem is that studies fail to ensure vapers are not smoking cigarettes as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The absolute effects of vapes and their impact on oral health are unknown,” a spokesperson for the British Dental Association said. But they added that recent, limited evidence did raise concerns over oral dryness, irritation and gum disease caused by vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-the-studies-say" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What do the studies say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers at Newcastle University published a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41432-025-01119-6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;major review&lt;/a&gt; this year into the impact of vaping on periodontal health, meaning the gums, ligaments and bone that supports our teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Two markers of long-term disease are bone loss and pockets in the gum tissue around teeth, but there was no evidence these were any worse in vapers than in non-smokers or former smokers. The vapers did have slightly worse gum disease, “but it was pretty marginal”, said Dr Richard Holliday, a senior lecturer and honorary consultant in restorative dentistry at Newcastle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-tooth-decay" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What about tooth decay?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Again, the evidence is tentative, but there are some concerns. In &lt;a href="https://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177%2822%2900577-3/abstract" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one recent study&lt;/a&gt;, US researchers analysed patient records for more than 13,000 people who attended dental clinics between 2019 and 2022. “Patients who vaped did show an increased risk of developing dental caries when compared to non-smoking and non-vaping patients,” Dr Karina Irusa, the study’s first author, told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Newcastle team also found higher levels of plaque in vapers compared with non-smokers or former smokers, which would be in keeping with a greater risk of dental caries. But more studies are needed to investigate whether vaping itself is to blame for tooth decay. There’s evidence that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5269575/#:~:text=Nicotine%20dependence%20was%20positively%20correlated,context%20of%20depression%20and%20stress." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nicotine users eat more sugar&lt;/a&gt;, so vapers may have bad teeth for reasons other than their nicotine habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-might-vaping-cause-tooth-decay" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;How might vaping cause tooth decay?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A common claim is that sugar in flavoured vapes drives tooth decay, but manufacturers tend to use artificial sweeteners instead of sugar. This is because sugar burns at vape-operating temperatures, so using them would produce a burnt flavour and clog up the heating coil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If vaping does drive tooth decay, Holliday suspects that having a dry mouth, which vapers often mention, is part of the problem. “Saliva is a wonderful thing to protect your teeth. When you reduce that, tooth decay can happen more rapidly and gum disease can happen more rapidly, too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Saliva helps to keep teeth clean and it also contains calcium and phosphate that help withstand acid attacks from bacteria, and from drinks such as fruit juices, which are the key drivers of tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;How vapes cause a dry mouth isn’t entirely clear, but vape liquids are the prime culprits. They are mostly propylene glycol and vegetable glycerol, which are hygroscopic, meaning they absorb and hold on to water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-cancer" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What about cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People who vape do not inhale anything like the number and variety of carcinogens in cigarette smoke. For this reason, the risk appears low. But it is an area scientists are watching, because vapers are still regularly inhaling chemicals into their bodies and the long-term effects on the delicate tissue in the lungs and elsewhere are not yet known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-vaping-safe-for-young-people" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;Is vaping safe for young people?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, summed it up like this: “If you smoke, vaping is much safer; if you don’t smoke, don’t vape.” According to Holliday, that is sound advice. “If you’re a young person, don’t vape,” he said. “You are putting something into a complicated ecosystem, so there will be risks from vaping long term.

Trial investigators also observed a reduction in the level of a toxic protein linked to neurodegeneration in the spinal fluid of people who received the therapy. On the strength of these findings, uniQure executives said they plan to seek regulatory approval for the treatment next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This gene therapy is obviously a big step forward,” says Sandra Kostyk, a neurologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, who was involved in the trial. “The data look quite good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowing the disease’s advance could translate into many extra years of independence for people with Huntington’s, Kostyk says, but it is not a cure. And, with so few participants, the trial’s results — still unpublished — should be viewed as preliminary, she adds. “I think we need more time and more data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A deadly repeat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living with Huntington’s disease typically see their symptoms progress year by year, usually starting between the ages of 35 and 55. What often begins as a subtle loss of coordination or forgetfulness then often progresses to involuntary movements, sharp mood swings and a gradual unravelling of memory and thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is caused by excessive DNA repeats in a gene called huntingtin, which leads to the production of a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00119-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00119-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;faulty protein that slowly poisons the brain&lt;/a&gt;. There are currently no therapies that address this root cause, so those who inherit the mutation are left only with drugs that ease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the first attempts to develop a treatment focused on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0452-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0452-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;antisense therapy&lt;/a&gt;, a gene-targeted strategy that uses short strands of DNA or RNA to dial down production of the defective huntingtin protein. The approach showed promise in early clinical development&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01177-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01177-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;hopes dimmed in 2021&lt;/a&gt; after a leading candidate failed in late-stage testing, with those receiving the therapy seeming to fare worse than those who were given a placebo&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This clinical setback redirected attention towards a different strategy: gene therapy, which aims to provide a one-time intervention that permanently silences or modifies the deficient gene at its source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Molecular muzzle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of uniQure’s gene therapy, the treatment uses a harmless virus to deliver the recipe for making a short RNA sequence known as a microRNA directly into cells in the affected parts of the brain. The microRNA is designed to ‘muzzle’ the defective huntingtin gene — and stop the cells producing the faulty protein — by blocking the molecular instructions encoded by the gene, known as mRNA. Once delivered, the virus-encoded instructions stay inside the cells, which continue to produce the therapeutic microRNA. The discovery of microRNAs was feted with a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03212-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03212-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Nobel Prize last year&lt;/a&gt;, although the technology &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03303-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03303-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;has yet to yield any approved medicines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Administering the treatment requires a lengthy surgery in which clinicians use magnetic resonance imaging to precisely place a cannula through small holes in the skull. The therapy is then infused slowly into the striatum, a part of the brain that is among the first and hardest hit by Huntington’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Find yourself prone to anxiety? The roots of the condition could stretch back to before you were even born, according to a new study in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Weill Cornell Medicine in the US have found that infection or stress in a mother &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pregnancy-ages-a-persons-cells-but-some-may-undergo-an-unexpected-rejuvenation"&gt;during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; could increase the risk of the offspring developing anxiety as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/DBP.0000000000000916"&gt;shown links&lt;/a&gt; between prenatal health problems and mental health issues later in life, including anxiety. In this latest investigation, researchers took a close look at potential neurological mechanisms that could be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-anxiety-in-young-womens-brains-may-have-been-found"&gt;The Secret to Anxiety in Young Women's Brains May Have Been Found&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team genetically engineered mice in a way that simulates extra inflammation that a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/profound-brain-changes-of-pregnancy-revealed-in-scientific-first"&gt;pregnant mother&lt;/a&gt; might experience under stressful conditions. Then, they carefully monitored the offspring produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team focused on male offspring, who have more pronounced anxiety behaviors than females. These offspring were also genetically "normal", meaning they didn't inherit the predisposition for stress and inflammation from their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, as adults, these offspring still showed telltale signs of anxiety, such as avoiding open spaces. What's more, scans indicated that a small number of brain cells in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus"&gt;ventral dentate gyrus&lt;/a&gt; (vDG), which helps assess potential threats in the surrounding environment, were working overtime when the animals felt threatened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our data reveal prenatal adversity left lasting imprints on the neurons of the vDG, linking gestational environment to anxiety-like behavior," &lt;a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2025/09/inflammation-during-pregnancy-may-prime-offspring-for-anxiety"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuropharmacologist Miklos Toth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This mechanism may help explain the persistent stress sensitivity and avoidance seen in some individuals with innate anxiety."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174946" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174946" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseAnxiety.jpg" alt="Mouse pregnancy study" class="wp-image-174946 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseAnxiety.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseAnxiety-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseAnxiety-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174946" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mice exposed to stress in the womb were shown to be more anxious as adults. (Nabila et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Rep.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also able to look at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt; in the brains of the mice, a chemical tagging system that controls whether specific genes are turned on or off. These on-off switches were modified at thousands of sites along DNA strands collected from the vDG, especially in gene regions that control neuron communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the mice felt they were under threat, it was in these reprogrammed areas where the neurons were working the hardest. It seems as though the mouse brains are coded to be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-figuring-out-if-its-anxiety-adhd-or-both-matters"&gt;more anxious&lt;/a&gt; about potential threats, and more eager to avoid them, even before the threat has actually appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, these  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/epigenetic-changes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73027" data-postid="174943" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epigenetic changes&lt;/a&gt; are instructing certain neurons in the vDG to respond differently in adulthood when faced with unsafe environments," &lt;a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2025/09/inflammation-during-pregnancy-may-prime-offspring-for-anxiety"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuropharmacologist Kristen Pleil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The neurons show too much activity, ultimately contributing to the mice perceiving the environment as more threatening than it actually is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety is one of the more common mental health problems, and is thought to affect &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2010.05.017"&gt;almost a third of us&lt;/a&gt; at some point during our lifetimes. Scientists are consistently making new discoveries about the different factors that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-a-high-fat-diet-may-increase-your-anxiety-study-warns"&gt;increase the risk of anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and how we might be able &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-anxiety-in-young-womens-brains-may-have-been-found"&gt;to better treat it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although only shown in mice so far, this new study hints at how the earliest stages of life could influence anxiety risk in adults, and may even feed into the development of diagnostic tests for the condition and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-5-minute-breathing-technique-is-a-powerful-tool-to-reduce-anxiety"&gt;perhaps even treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also a reminder of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vitamin-d-during-pregnancy-linked-to-cognitive-boost-in-children"&gt;how vital a healthy pregnancy is&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers are keen to continue their work by looking more closely at the mechanism they've uncovered, and why only a subset of neurons are affected by stresses in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A mouse may have almost 400,000 cells in the vDG, but only a few thousand are impacted during pregnancy," &lt;a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2025/09/inflammation-during-pregnancy-may-prime-offspring-for-anxiety"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Toth. "Next, we really want to understand why these certain cells are epigenetically programmed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.116219"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While many participants had completed higher education and were employed or in relationships, the study found that those diagnosed in adulthood reported more psychiatric conditions, higher rates of suicidal thoughts and self-harm, and fewer self-perceived strengths. The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.70073" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Autism Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, point to a need for more research and tailored support for this often-overlooked population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism is a developmental condition characterized by differences in social communication and restricted or repetitive behaviors. While research and diagnosis have traditionally centered on boys, more recent efforts have drawn attention to the ways autism may present differently in women and nonbinary people. Females are less likely to be diagnosed in early childhood, in part due to more subtle behavioral signs and greater likelihood of “masking,” or consciously imitating neurotypical social behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women and gender-diverse individuals have also been underrepresented in clinical studies due to narrow inclusion criteria, diagnostic biases, and the tendency of researchers to exclude people with co-occurring intellectual disabilities, who are disproportionately female. As a result, there has been limited understanding of what life looks like for autistic women and nonbinary individuals beyond childhood—especially those who are diagnosed in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the new study set out to better characterize this population by assessing a wide range of factors, including education, employment, relationships, psychiatric history, and self-perceived mental health. A second goal was to explore how outcomes differ between those diagnosed in childhood versus adulthood, with the aim of understanding how timing of diagnosis may shape long-term experiences and needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My research focuses on diverse experiences of autism, including adult populations and autistic females,” said study author Maire Claire Diemer, a clinical psychology postdoctoral fellow at the Medical University of South Carolina. “It’s important to me to fill this gap in the literature and represent what I can as accurately as I can about broader experiences of autistic presentations. Research has often excluded adults, women, and people with co-occurring intellectual disabilities which means that the literature does not always reflect their experiences. This can have clinical implications for care as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used data from &lt;a href="https://sparkforautism.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;SPARK&lt;/a&gt;, a large national research cohort in the United States that includes over 100,000 autistic individuals and family members. The sample for this study included 1,424 participants who identified as women or were assigned female at birth and identified as nonbinary. All participants were age 18 or older and had received a professional diagnosis of autism either in childhood or adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be included in the analysis, participants had to provide independent consent and complete several self-report forms about their demographic background, medical and psychiatric history, and psychological functioning. Individuals under guardianship or with uncertain autism diagnoses were excluded to ensure reliability of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a standardized psychological questionnaire known as the Adult Self Report, which assesses areas such as internalizing symptoms (like anxiety and depression), externalizing symptoms (like aggression and rule-breaking), substance use, adaptive functioning, and personal strengths. The researchers also collected information about participants’ education, employment, income, romantic relationships, and sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then compared the responses of those who had been diagnosed before age 18 with those who had received a diagnosis in adulthood. They used statistical methods to control for age at enrollment, since those diagnosed as children were, on average, younger at the time of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average age of diagnosis among the full sample was 24 years, but there was wide variability. Those diagnosed in childhood were typically diagnosed around age 9, while those diagnosed as adults received their diagnosis at an average age of 32. Nearly two-thirds of the sample had been diagnosed after turning 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges often associated with autism, many participants reported positive life outcomes. More than half were employed, and over 80 percent had completed some post-secondary education. Nearly one-third were married, and more than half reported having a romantic partner. Those diagnosed in adulthood were more likely to have a four-year college degree, full-time employment, and higher household incomes than those diagnosed in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, rates of co-occurring psychiatric conditions were high. Around 70 percent of participants reported a history of anxiety, and 62 percent had been diagnosed with depression. Eating disorders were reported by 17 percent of the sample, and almost 9 percent had a substance use diagnosis. A third of all participants reported experiencing suicidal thoughts, and 21 percent said they had engaged in self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diemer was particularly surprised by the high rate of suicidal ideation and behavior. “While I feared there would be increased risks, the high rate still shocked and concerned me,” she told PsyPost. “We have really limited research into what might be driving this or what we can do to be preventative on this front.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When comparing the two groups, those diagnosed as adults were significantly more likely to report psychiatric conditions. They were more likely to have anxiety, depression, and eating disorders, and reported higher levels of substance use. On average, they also scored higher on internalizing and externalizing problem scales and lower on measures of personal strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These patterns held even after controlling for other demographic variables like age, education, employment, and parenthood. Later age of diagnosis remained a significant predictor of psychological distress. The researchers suggest that these differences may reflect the cumulative impact of going through childhood and adolescence without the support or self-understanding that a diagnosis can provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found elevated levels of suicidal ideation and self-harm among participants who identified as gender-diverse or as part of a sexual minority. While 14 percent of cisgender heterosexual participants reported self-harm or suicide attempts, the rate was nearly 27 percent among those identifying as queer or gender-diverse. Suicidal thoughts were endorsed by 41 percent of gender and sexual minorities, compared to 26 percent of cisgender heterosexual participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest concern here is the high rate of suicidal ideation and behavior,” Diemer said. “As researchers, we expected higher rates of co-occurring concerns in this sample compared to a neurotypical sample based on prior findings. However, more than two thirds of our sample had depression diagnoses, and overall rates were much higher than even we expected. Supports for autistic adults is extremely limited, and more wraparound services and mental health care with specialized focus is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study provides important insights, it is not without limitations. The sample was overwhelmingly white and highly educated, which may not reflect the broader population of autistic women and nonbinary people. The participants were also self-selected and enrolled in a research study requiring internet access and independent consent, which may have skewed the sample toward individuals with lower support needs and higher cognitive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This sample is not as racially diverse as the population as a whole; over-representation of the white female autistic perspective means that the generalizability of the findings are limited,” Diemer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the authors argue that the findings point to clear directions for future research and clinical care. In particular, they emphasize the need to understand the lived experiences of those who receive an autism diagnosis in adulthood. They also highlight the importance of developing targeted mental health interventions that address the specific challenges faced by autistic women and nonbinary individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to continue examining data we have on autistic females, and hopefully presenting some other findings from this sample soon,” Diemer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.70073" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Comparative Analysis of Autistic Women Across the Lifespan: Childhood vs. Adulthood Diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Maire Claire Diemer, Rosmary Ros-Demarize, Catherine C.

			&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, most heart attacks have been blamed on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/plastic-found-inside-more-than-50-of-plaques-from-clogged-arteries"&gt;clogged arteries&lt;/a&gt; causing &lt;a href="https://cardiology.com.sg/atherothrombosis/"&gt;atherothrombosis&lt;/a&gt; – where blood clots block flow to the heart. But new research suggests we may be underestimating the role of other causes, particularly in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the Mayo Clinic in the US analyzed 1,474 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-own-mouth-bacteria-could-give-you-a-heart-attack-new-study-suggests"&gt;heart attack cases&lt;/a&gt; in people aged 65 or younger, recorded between 2003 and 2018 in Olmsted County, Minnesota. By carefully reviewing medical records and imaging, they identified a primary cause behind each case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atherothrombosis accounted for 75 percent of heart attacks in men, which wasn't surprising. In women, it was the cause of 47 percent – less than half. That has major implications for the prevention and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-drug-better-than-aspirin-for-repeat-heart-attacks-study-finds"&gt;treatment of heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/viral-heart-attack-hack-on-social-media-could-put-lives-at-risk-experts-say"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viral Heart Attack 'Hack' on Social Media Could Put Lives at Risk, Experts Say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This research shines a spotlight on heart attack causes that have historically been under-recognized, particularly in women," &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-reveals-hidden-causes-of-heart-attacks-in-younger-adults-especially-women/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist Claire Raphael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the root cause of a heart attack is misunderstood, it can lead to treatments that are less effective – or even harmful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175234" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175234" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DiagnosisChart.jpg" alt="Heart attack causes" class="wp-image-175234 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DiagnosisChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DiagnosisChart-600x251.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175234" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;There were significant differences in heart attack causes between men and women. (Raphael et al., &lt;em&gt;J. Am. Coll. Cardiol.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the other factors significantly contributing to heart attacks were &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_coronary_artery_dissection"&gt;spontaneous coronary artery dissections&lt;/a&gt; (SCADs), where tears in artery walls collect blood, embolisms (blood clots traveling from other areas of the body), and other stressors acting on the body (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"&gt;such as anemia&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found that many SCAD-related heart attacks were initially misattributed to atherothrombosis, especially in women, where SCAD was the cause nearly six times as frequently. If heart attack causes are misdiagnosed, then doctors might take the wrong approach to trying to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-vitamin-may-help-prevent-heart-attacks-new-evidence"&gt;prevent the next one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research highlights the larger need to rethink how we approach heart attacks in this patient population, and for younger adult women, in particular," &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-reveals-hidden-causes-of-heart-attacks-in-younger-adults-especially-women/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist Rajiv Gulati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinicians must sharpen their awareness of conditions like SCAD, embolism and stress-related triggers, and patients should advocate for answers when something doesn't feel right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study didn't explore the significant difference here between men and women, but it could be the result of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-minute-quiz-could-reveal-whether-youre-at-risk-of-a-heart-attack"&gt;heart attack risk factors&lt;/a&gt; affecting women differently, or women being less likely to seek medical help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's something that future research can look into, as well as using the same analysis techniques across larger and more diverse groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, someone experiences a heart attack &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html"&gt;every 40 seconds&lt;/a&gt;, and work continues to try and understand as much as we can about the risk factors – which include &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/big-city-lights-could-be-damaging-your-heart-health"&gt;city living&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-gram-of-salt-is-the-difference-for-millions-of-heart-attacks"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tiny-particles-in-the-air-may-trigger-sudden-heart-attacks-study-suggests"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, as the team notes, we're getting better at spotting, diagnosing, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.120.047065"&gt;preventing heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; from recurring. Significant progress has been made in heart imaging technology, for example, over the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers now want to see more done to raise awareness of the alternative causes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/doctor-realizes-hes-having-a-heart-attack-while-treating-heart-attack-patient"&gt;behind heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;, both with health professionals and the public – which could ultimately save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding why a heart attack happened is just as important as treating it," &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-reveals-hidden-causes-of-heart-attacks-in-younger-adults-especially-women/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Raphael. "It can mean the difference between recovery and recurrence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.07.012"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Three children have died of measles this week as a monthslong outbreak continues to spread across Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the victims of the disease this week were younger than two, and all three died in Jerusalem, according to hospital officials and the Health Ministry. The first death was announced on Monday, another died on Wednesday night, and the third died Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, five children, all younger than two and a half years old, have died of measles since August. They are the first fatalities from measles in Israel since a previous outbreak hit the country in 2018-2019. The fatalities in that bout of measles were the first Israel had seen since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The current outbreak, which began in May, is active throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles cases have appeared in the central cities of Jerusalem, Beit Shemesh and Bnei Brak, the northern cities of Harish and Nof HaGalil, the southern cities of Ashdod and Kiryat Gat, and the West Bank settlement of Modi’in Illit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Three Jerusalem children die of measles this week as outbreak continues"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday, 21 measles patients are hospitalized, most of them children 6 or under who have not been vaccinated against measles. Of these, six children are in intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A notice warning of measles is seen on a door in the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim in Jerusalem, July 31, 2025. (Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late August, the Health Ministry &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/770-measles-cases-detected-in-israel-in-past-three-months-says-health-ministry/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that 770 people in Israel had been diagnosed with measles over the past three months. Multiple people with measles, or who had been exposed to the disease, are reported to have come to Israel on flights from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious, life-threatening viral disease. When symptoms appear, it is important to inform medical teams to allow treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;Measles is preventable through an effective and safe vaccine. Doctors have &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/infectious-disease-doctor-calls-on-community-leaders-to-encourage-measles-vaccines/"&gt;urged&lt;/a&gt; ramped-up vaccination drives in response to the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

            

&lt;p&gt;Maria Branyas was the oldest person in the world when she died at 117 in Spain last year – but a look at her genome suggests that her biological age may have been much younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health experts and the public alike have long been fascinated with supercentenarians – those who live to at least 110 – and what their longevity reveals about the keys to ageing well.&lt;/p&gt;        

&lt;p&gt;Before she died in August 2024, Branyas agreed to help a group of Spanish scientists find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she was 116, they collected samples of her blood, saliva, urine, and stool to analyse her genetics and microbiome and compare the results with bigger groups of similarly aged people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branyas had biomarkers of very old age, including shortened telomeres – which indicate cellular ageing – as well as a type of B cell known to accumulate with age and clonal hematopoiesis, another age-related condition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, she also had low inflammation levels, “rejuvenated” gut health, and a youthful epigenome, or changes to how genes are expressed without affecting our actual DNA.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;Branyas, who the researchers called “one exceptional individual,” also had unusual variations in her genetic code that appeared to protect against common health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and neurodegeneration, which is linked to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings offer “a fresh look at human ageing biology, suggesting biomarkers for healthy ageing, and potential strategies to increase life expectancy,” according to the researchers, who published their findings in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00441-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cell Reports Medicine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Branyas’s genetics seem to have played a major role in her longevity, the researchers also tried to identify which of her lifestyle habits may have helped.&lt;/p&gt;
  


&lt;p&gt;The supercentenarian ate about three yoghurts per day, they said, which they said may have contributed to her gut health and body weight. She mainly stuck to a Mediterranean diet, kept good sleep habits, stayed physically active, and had good mental health overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branyas also had an active social life and had regular hobbies such as reading, playing the piano, and tending her garden – in other words, a well-rounded life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All these findings illustrate how ageing and disease can, under certain conditions, become decoupled,” the researchers said, “challenging the common perception that they are inextricably linked”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re headed into cold and flu season and you want your shots, including an updated COVID booster. Where can a New Yorker go to get the jab?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Food and Drug Administration changed its regulations around the COVID vaccine this summer to limit access, New York state crafted a workaround to preserve people’s ability to get a booster. Nonetheless, confusion has reigned in pharmacies across New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-executive-order-expanding-access-vaccines-amid-uncertainty-washington"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; by Gov. Kathy Hochul technically allows pharmacies to administer the vaccine to anyone three years old and older. But the Centers for Disease Control recently changed its guidelines around the COVID vaccine that further mixed messaging, creating a choose-your-own-adventure scenario for shot-seekers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know now about finding (and paying for) the new COVID shots in New York City 2025:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-i-get-a-covid-booster-in-new-york-city-and-where"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I get a COVID booster in New York City, and where?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can, but where you get it depends on a few factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CVS, Walgreens and independent pharmacies, the COVID vaccine is allowed to be administered, but availability and whether you will have to pay for it varies (more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hochul’s Sept. 5 &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-executive-order-expanding-access-vaccines-amid-uncertainty-washington"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; allows pharmacies in the state to offer the COVID vaccine to those under 65 without an underlying health condition and without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;

Kathy Hochul at a Manhattan pharmacy, Sept. 16, 2025. &lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;&lt;span class="credit-label-wrapper"&gt;Credit:&lt;/span&gt; Alex Krales/THE CITY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did this in response to the FDA releasing the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/coronavirus-covid-19-cber-regulated-biologics/moderna-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;most restrictive&lt;/a&gt; COVID vaccine regulations since the shot’s inception. The federal policy said that only those 65 and older or people with an underlying condition are eligible to get the updated vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hochul’s executive order suspends those federal rules until Oct. 5, and she may choose to extend it further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the governor’s order, availability of the vaccines is spotty in New York City. When THE CITY reached out to pharmacies across the five boroughs in recent days, many were not offering the shot, or were administering it only to certain populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Esco Pharmacy in Hell’s Kitchen — where Hochul herself &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOrX69ckr4t/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="&gt;received the COVID booster last week&lt;/a&gt; — pharmacists are following FDA guidelines and not offering the vaccine to anyone between the ages of 18 and 65 who do not have a health condition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is confusing to our staff and the patient, as well,” said Danny Dang, pharmacist at Esco, of the current guidelines. “We do see the benefits of the vaccination. I’ve seen a lot of patients who came to us for COVID treatment that could have been prevented by the vaccine if we had done it earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marisa Donnelly, epidemiologist and author of the column &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com"&gt;“Your Local Epidemiologist,”&lt;/a&gt; explains that just because pharmacies are allowed to administer a vaccine doesn’t mean they will.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“There’s still, I think, a lot of internal policies that different pharmacy companies have,” Donnelly says. “They’re all allowed to give vaccines, but that doesn’t mean that they necessarily will. They can still go with their own guidelines and decide not to give a vaccine if they don’t want to. But they are allowed within the state.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-should-get-the-booster"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should get the booster?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the executive order from Hochul, everyone over three years old should be able to get the COVID shot. But, as stated above, the CDC and FDA says something else entirely, muddying the waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines.page#:~:text=On%20September%205%2C%20Governor%20Hochul,who%20wish%20to%20be%20vaccinated."&gt;The New York City Health Department&lt;/a&gt; says it is especially important for the following groups of people to get the COVID booster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All adults ages 65 and older&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;All children ages 6 to 23 months &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People who are pregnant or recently gave birth &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People of any age who have an underlying condition that increases their risk for severe COVID-19 &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People at high risk of exposure, such as health care workers and people living or working in a nursing home or other congregate setting&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People living with someone with an underlying condition that increases their risk for severe COVID-19&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People who have never been vaccinated before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bruce Y. Lee, a professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health &amp;amp; Health Policy, recommends the shot for anyone whose last vaccine was over six months ago, since immunity starts to wane after four to six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“On top of that, the last set of vaccines were protected against an earlier variant,” Lee says. “Right now, the variants that are circulating are different from previous, so your protection is probably even lower against the current variants. So if you haven’t gotten a vaccine for at least six months or greater, then it’s a good idea to get the vaccine, especially headed into winter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-about-shots-for-city-kids"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about shots for city kids?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All kids three years to 18 are eligible to be vaccinated in New York State –– no prescription or underlying health condition needed. (6 to 23 month old kids are considered a high risk population and so their eligibility for the vaccine was never under threat)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, THE CITY found that availability for shots for young people is spotty. Some independent pharmacies that are offering the vaccine for adults just don’t have it available or stocked for kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren Naturale, a Sunset Park mom, tried to get her six-year-old daughter vaccinated before traveling for a family wedding where a lot of older people would be in attendance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturale attempted to make a vaccine appointment for her daughter at CVS, but when she went to finalize, would repeatedly get an error message. She tried again the following week and was able to make an appointment. Upon arrival at a CVS that was 40 minutes away, Naturale was told the store must have miscategorized them in CVS’s system because they did not have vaccines for children under 12. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It sounds like you can get them, it would just be great if there was clear information,” Naturale said about children’s vaccines in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wasn’t able to get her daughter one before they left for the wedding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully we’ll be able to make that happen when we get back to the city,” Naturale said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shots for all young people under 19 years old should be covered by your insurer by law. (More on this below.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-i-need-a-prescription"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need a prescription?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, you do not need a prescription to get the COVID shot. Hochul’s executive order from earlier this month made it clear that people seeking the COVID vaccine do not need a prescription. If a provider demands one, try another pharmacy, call your local health department about finding a vaccine, or contact your primary care doctor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-this-going-to-cost-me"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is this going to cost me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really depends on your insurance and whether your insurer is choosing to cover the COVID vaccine right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because a key committee at the Centers for Disease Control — the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html"&gt;declined last week to recommend&lt;/a&gt; the COVID vaccine this season. Its recommendation is the federal standard insurers traditionally follow for coverage of all kinds of medical services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means: Local pharmacies are allowed to give the COVID vaccine, but it may not be paid for by your insurance. At &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine"&gt;CVS&lt;/a&gt;, an out of pocket COVID vaccine could cost you up to $249.99. At Esco Pharmacy, an independent pharmacy in Hell’s Kitchen, it costs about $265, staff there said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry-guidance/circular-letters/cl2025-05"&gt;Department of Financial Services&lt;/a&gt; issued guidance encouraging insurers to continue covering the COVID vaccine, but that isn’t binding. However, the letter notes that New York State law requires insurers to fully cover vaccines for children under 19, because they were deemed necessary immunizations in 2020 –– a decision that still stands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some insurers, like UnitedHealthcare, are choosing to continue covering the shot for everyone despite the ACIP declining to recommend the shot.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“For our standard commercial plans, we will continue to cover claims for COVID-19 vaccines with no cost share,” UnitedHealthcare said in a statement. The insurer said they recommend members who use an employer sponsored plan to confirm benefits with their specific plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-my-local-pharmacy-isn-t-offering-the-shot-what-now"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My local pharmacy isn’t offering the shot. What now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee recommends contacting your doctor’s office or the &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/neighborhood-health/health-services.page"&gt;local health department&lt;/a&gt; if you’re having trouble getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walgreens and CVS have the COVID vaccine available for those under 65 without a health condition. But to schedule an appointment online, you have to “confirm you are eligible,” or answer yes that you have a health condition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My guess is the reason that that is existing is because it’s a national website,” Donnelly says. “And so I imagine that they have some of those settings for everywhere across the country, even if they don’t necessarily apply to New York State. But I do think that that’s a potential source of confusion for people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Donnelly worries that mixed messaging around the COVID vaccine is causing less people to get it, and even worse, sowing distrust in the medical system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest issue right now is there’s so much noise around vaccines and it’s so confusing to follow,” Donnelly says. “So I think that’s actually a potential deterrent for a lot of families that want to get vaccinated, but that maybe don’t understand that they can or they are eligible now.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-else-can-i-do-to-prevent-covid"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else can I do to prevent COVID?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee notes that while the COVID vaccine does protect against the worst outcomes of the virus, it doesn’t guarantee not getting it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You also want to continue to take other types of precautions, especially when you’re in a location or an area where the risk of getting infected is high,” Lee says. “Say you’re in a very crowded location, it’s still important to make sure that the area is well ventilated. That, and evidence has shown that masks can help cut down transmission. So, all of these things that came out during the beginning of the COVID pandemic still hold.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time of mixed messaging, it’s important to distinguish which evidence is scientifically sound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you see something that’s repeated across different respectable and evidence-based websites, then you can feel more confident that it’s a consensus that different folks have come to the same conclusion,” Lee says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most reliable sources, he says, include international health organizations like the World Health Organization, Health Canada, and the U.K.’s The National Health Service. Major U.S. health systems like John Hopkins, the Mayo Clinic, and the Cleveland Clinic also provide trustworthy guidance. The New York City’s health department is also considered one of the largest public health agencies in the world and offers evidence-based health recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

First it receives information from &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb07070.x" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;the brain areas&lt;/a&gt; that process vision, smell, taste and hearing. If the amygdala detects a threat, such as an approaching burglar, snake or bear, it then sends messages to the hypothalamus, a region just above the back of the neck. The hypothalamus then &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-hpa-axis" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;communicates&lt;/a&gt; with the pituitary gland, which in turns gets the adrenal glands to release cortisol and adrenaline into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"This will cause your heart rate to go up, blood pressure to rise, and all the classic sort of fight-or-flight symptoms of a typical fear response will be evoked," says Feinstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, when it comes to internal threats, such as detecting raised levels of CO2 in the blood, the brain manages things in a different way. The body interprets the high CO2 as a sign of impending suffocation, as there aren't any oxygen sensors in the bloodstream. Feinstein's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051122000473" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that it is the brainstem, a region that regulates unconscious bodily functions such as breathing, that senses the rise in CO2 and initiates a sense of panic. The amygdala puts the brakes on this response, preventing fear; hence why patients like SM, who are missing their amygdala, have such an exaggerated response. (Scientists still don't know why, however, the amygdala behaves this way.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 09:01:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNdDNwenZiSUUyOC1EMm9Eb3B0RWthVUdNSGpKMHdJYXdWQjJoekZ2N2hDLThNdm9ra3dmaEJFcWc2SklLY2loZWgyd2gtZWJpM2NmTlppT2xTSkVfZjVFaXI3YWswNUF0WHB2RE9oc2YwaFJ4TnNZdnBuUk5EZ0t0RnMxZGd3V1NrX2dLVFdjMlA</guid></item><item><title>疫苗混乱？明尼苏达州的5个问题，已回答- MPR新闻</title><link>https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/09/25/answers-to-questions-about-covid19-vaccines</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Auth_supplementalText__LpEPr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By submitting, you consent that you are at least 18 years of age and to receive information about MPR's or APMG entities' programs and offerings.

His family are now braced to fight a new challenge after he was diagnosed with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was having dreams of planning his funeral,' his mother Kelsey, 34, told the New York Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kelsey noticed his delayed motor skills at around eight months. Despite starting physical therapy, he made no progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The concerns heightened at around 18 months, when Jack could not walk or bear weight on his legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kelsey used to call him 'spaghetti man' because he would collapse every time he attempted to stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After endless physical therapy and doctors visits, the New Jersey family was left in the dark for another six months when a lab lost Jack's samples for his neurological genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some days filled with hope, others with really dark thoughts,' said Tim Drury, Jack’s father. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;his delayed milestones lead to the discovery of a rare degenerative nervous system disorder with an average life expectancy of just ten years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A month after his second birthday, Jack was diagnosed with INAD, a rare genetic disorder caused by a genetic mutation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A month after his second birthday, Jack was diagnosed with INAD, a rare genetic disorder caused by a genetic mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both parents pass a copy of the faulty PLA2G6 gene to the fetus. While carrier screening is available, it is complex because INAD is extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It affects the nerve cell that carries messages from the brain to other parts of the body, according to the National institution of neurological disorders (NIH). There is no known cure or treatment to slow the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A baby with INAD is alert and responsive for the first few years but starts to lose vision, muscular control, and mental skills over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fewer than 250 kids worldwide have been diagnosed according to The National Organization for Rare disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rare diagnosis even stunned Jack's pediatricians. 'The neurologist who shared the genetic results with us admitted she hadn’t heard of it before,' Tim told the NY Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nonprofit INADcure Foundation is a glimmer of hope amidst the dreary disease. &lt;span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is one of the only organizations aiming for a potential treatment and cure, based right in their home state of New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fewer than 250 kids worldwide have been diagnosed according to The National Organization for Rare disorders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A baby with INAD is alert and responsive for the first few years but starts to lose vision, muscular control, and mental skills over time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nonprofit has worked with scientists for years to develop a gene therapy treatment for a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family created 'Jack’s Miracle Mission' to raise $450,000 - funds the foundation needed to pay the manufacturer- and are waiting on FDA approval to start the clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tim said the foundation has a goal to start early next year but there are only 10 spots available, so Jack's place is not guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Jack is one of the younger participants globally that they’re aware of, so I think there’s certainly potential that he’ll be part of this study,' Tim told the NY Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The average treatment cost will equate to about $200,000 per child, Jack’s Miracle Mission is working to raise $2 million to cover the full cost&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average treatment cost will equate to about $200,000 per child.

They said the finding could one day lead to drug treatments designed to target the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London examined genetic data from the tumours of 644 patients and found that levels of the SPP1 protein were raised in the advanced stages of pancreatic cancer, compared with earlier stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with higher levels of SPP1 had worse outcomes, according to the research, which has been published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, funded by the ICR and Breast Cancer Now, also used lab-grown mini tumours designed to model the way cancer behaves in the human body. They found that when they “switched off” the gene to make the SPP1 protein, fewer and smaller tumours developed than when the protein was present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that this protein played a key role in mice with PDAC. They found that “switching off” SPP1 significantly extended survival among mice – none of the mice with the gene survived past 50 days, whereas 20 per cent of the mice without the gene survived to 400 days, the ICR said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found that the mice with the SPP1 gene switched off had tumours that did not spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 kIHKfN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/14/16/9bc36b1928bbb8bc24d119c5e1099357Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIzNzI2MDgz-2.76852342.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/14/16/9bc36b1928bbb8bc24d119c5e1099357Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIzNzI2MDgz-2.76852342.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/14/16/9bc36b1928bbb8bc24d119c5e1099357Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIzNzI2MDgz-2.76852342.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The team, funded by the ICR and Breast Cancer Now, used lab-grown mini tumours designed to model the way cancer behaves in the human body" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18008"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The team, funded by the ICR and Breast Cancer Now, used lab-grown mini tumours designed to model the way cancer behaves in the human body&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (PA Wire)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking SPP1 also appeared to raise the levels of another protein called GREM1, which has previously been linked to reducing pancreatic cancer spread when it is found in higher concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Axel Behrens, a professor of stem cell biology at the ICR, said: “Our research has identified a protein that, when blocked, can prevent cancer from spreading around the body and can hopefully keep patients living well for longer. The next step for this research will be to develop a drug that can precisely target the protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Kristian Helin, chief executive of the ICR, added: “Pancreatic cancer remains a devastating diagnosis for patients, as its most common form spreads aggressively and is difficult to treat. This exciting research offers hope, identifying a clear target to halt the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s an important step toward more effective treatments, and I look forward to future drug-discovery efforts building on these findings to provide new options to patients in urgent need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna Jewell, director of research at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said: “Over half of people diagnosed with this devastating disease die within just three months, an appalling survival rate that has barely changed since the 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We desperately need new, more effective treatments, and this study sheds new light on a key protein that helps pancreatic cancer spread around the body so rapidly. These promising findings could pave the way for the development of new drugs to target this protein and halt the cancer’s progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pancreatic cancer is very aggressive. Once discovered it’s often so advanced that seven in 10 people receive no active treatment – not even chemotherapy. Stopping the disease from spreading could give many more people the chance of lifesaving surgery or more precious time with their loved ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 06:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQLXllWHlyTF9qQ01CMmVFLWZBcXNPVEVvajU3Z0dZTFVaSFBKNDJNY2lIRjVWLWhWQzk3MUlSMGQzeVZfN0lPYmxYZU40Z0hQczBIbE5Sbjd0ejkyOXV4REtSSVlsWTlxMlZ0WEYyUnhrNzlqMW9yckpGUGUxbjZ6akNrcXNCYVJCN0MzaGV0cDRNTTUwZEJyeWIzdlpjZw</guid></item><item><title>突破性基因疗法使亨廷顿舞蹈症减缓75% - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-gene-therapy-slows-huntingtons-disease-by-75</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the United Kingdom say they have successfully trialed what could become the world's first gene therapy for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease"&gt;Huntington's disease&lt;/a&gt; – a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that is typically inherited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results of the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="175445" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; are not yet formally published or peer reviewed, principal investigator and neuroscientist Ed Wild from University College London &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/gene-therapy-appears-slow-huntingtons-disease-progression"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the gene therapy, called AMT-130, "changes everything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest dose can apparently slow disease progression by as much as 75 percent over three years. It also led to a significant reduction in a biomarker of neurodegeneration, found in cerebrospinal fluid, which usually increases with disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-breakthrough-experimental-drug-suppresses-huntington-s-protein-first-time-ionis-httrx-gene"&gt;Huge Breakthrough as Experimental Drug Is First-Ever to Suppress Huntington's Protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the basis of these results, it seems likely AMT-130 will be the first licensed treatment to slow Huntington's disease, which is truly world-changing stuff," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/gene-therapy-appears-slow-huntingtons-disease-progression"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wild, who works at UCL's Huntington's Disease Center, the largest Huntington's clinical group in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huntington's is caused by a single defect in the gene &lt;em&gt;HTT&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(93)90585-E"&gt;discovered in 1993&lt;/a&gt;, which gradually destroys the body's ability to function. It does so by making a toxic version of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingtin"&gt;huntingtin protein&lt;/a&gt;, which attacks neurons in parts of the brain involved in voluntary movement, thinking, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When visible symptoms take hold, typically in mid-adulthood, patients generally have just &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/huntingtons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356117"&gt;10 to 30 years to live&lt;/a&gt;. A parent with Huntington's has a 50 percent chance of passing the disease on to their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For roughly a decade, researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.uniqure.com/pioneers-leaders"&gt;uniQure&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/emmm.201202291"&gt;world's first approved gene therapy&lt;/a&gt;, have been investigating if a similar method could work as a treatment for Huntington's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175477" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175477" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AMT130.jpg" alt="Gene Therapy Huntington's" class="size-full wp-image-175477" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AMT130.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AMT130-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175477" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;uniQure's explanation from 2019 for how it administers AMT-130.

The idea is that when high-dose AMT-130 is injected into the brain, neurons take up the custom-made DNA permanently. The genetic information contains instructions that stop cells from making the mutant huntingtin protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers expect the single dose to last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Trial results come through in numbers and graphs, but behind each data point is an incredible patient who volunteered to undergo major neurosurgery to be treated with the first gene therapy we've ever tested in Huntington's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/gene-therapy-appears-slow-huntingtons-disease-progression"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is an extraordinary act of bravery for the benefit of humanity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the phase 1/2 clinical trial, 29 patients volunteered to be treated with AMT-130, with 17 receiving a high dose and 12 receiving a low dose. Researchers then followed up with a dozen patients from each group over the course of three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-dose group showed 75 percent less disease progression than participants who did not receive any AMT-130.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not quite the "&lt;a href="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii"&gt;potentially curative results&lt;/a&gt;" the company was hoping to deliver, but it could still be a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gene-therapy-can-restore-hearing-in-adults-first-of-its-kind-trial-shows"&gt;life-changing breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; and the first real treatment for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175481" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175481" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HD_brains.jpg" alt="HD brains" class="size-full wp-image-175481" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HD_brains.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HD_brains-600x236.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175481" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The brain of someone with Huntington's Disease (right) next to a health control (left).

In the span of &lt;a href="https://www.biospace.com/uniqure-announces-preclinical-proof-of-concept-for-gene-therapy-approach-in-huntington-s-disease-709323?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;roughly a decade&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at uniQure have taken promising preclinical data and replicated the results in animals and then humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is now conducting further &lt;span&gt;clinical trials&lt;/span&gt; in the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief medical officer, Walid Abi-Saab, &lt;a href="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; uniQure is "eager to discuss the data with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)… later this year, with the goal of submitting a Biologics License Application in the first quarter of 2026."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US FDA has already granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation and a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation, both of which could speed up its approval process. After that, uniQure also plans to apply for approval in the UK and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The trial results will be presented at the &lt;a href="https://huntingtonstudygroup.org/annual-meeting/2025-hd-clinical-research-congress/"&gt;HD Clinical Research Congress&lt;/a&gt; in October.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="384118f2-43fc-4a67-89a0-93821e7c9cde"&gt;No matter your relationship with exercise, it’s probably been drilled into you that you should warm up before playing sport or doing a workout. But does that apply to walking workouts too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s good to warm up before any type of exercise to promote proper movement mechanics and assist in preventing minor injuries that may occur when starting a workout cold,” says Solomon Lewis, a NASM-certified personal trainer and fitness specialist for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.endeavorhealth.org/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.endeavorhealth.org/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Endeavor Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="384118f2-43fc-4a67-89a0-93821e7c9cde-2"&gt;Even though walking is relatively low intensity, making a warm-up less important than if you were lifting heavy weights or running a marathon, Lewis pointed out that warming up before any workout can also serve to get you into the right mindset, and it’s a good idea if you’ve not moved for several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help prepare you for a walking workout, Lewis recommended three warm-up exercises and shared a 30-minute walking workout once you’re ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Starting with 30 minutes a day and steadily increasing the length or intensity of your walk is a great way to lose weight, strengthen your bones and improve your cardiovascular fitness,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cautions that if you are deconditioned, starting with a 30-minute workout out of the gate might be too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking for 30 minutes straight can be challenging. It may be simpler to incorporate small bouts of walking into your daily routine by parking in the farthest parking spot, walking to the farthest restroom and taking the stairs instead of the elevator,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bWvvJhJGfNGyCUz5jqR2jC" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bWvvJhJGfNGyCUz5jqR2jC slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/walking/walking-plan-weight-loss" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/walking/walking-plan-weight-loss"&gt;walking plan for weight loss&lt;/a&gt; may also help, because it can be adjusted to your current step count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-warm-up-exercises-for-walking-workouts" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-warm-up-exercises-for-walking-workouts"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Warm-up exercises for walking workouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a id="elk-f348be17-9037-481c-a0e1-8a35962f0daf" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="1-bodyweight-squat-3"&gt;1.

These groundbreaking data are the most convincing evidence in the field to date, and underscore the disease-modifying effect in Huntington’s disease, where an urgent need persists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For patients, AMT-130 has the potential to preserve daily function, keep them in work longer, and meaningfully slow disease progression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 04:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOMW1zUlhEc0JXYU5pcGNoNHZ2NzN3V3AwTTZESmNtLVJ3VmQ1dl9lNlpBSFNjTlhhNHUtUkxKOE9IN1NST3lhRUE1dWNNY3VSaWQ5bThtOFBGcHNJS1FBVGd0dXNiRDdIYjdzd1VSXzlpdi0ybFpSWnRaYXEzZzMxS0tWbXFEYUVyOUQtMGZHOHRrRmhxcFRsSGloMkZCNUJxZk5BcXNFYzQzZEtFaTJadi1n</guid></item><item><title>“这个日常习惯可以挽救你的生命！” ： 100岁的医生分享了令人惊讶的秘密，更长久，更健康-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/this-one-daily-habit-can-save-your-life-100-year-old-doctor-shares-surprising-secret-to-longer-healthier-living/articleshow/124087520.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. John Scharffenberg, a 100-year-old preventive medicine doctor and nutrition expert from California, reveals a simple yet powerful secret to longevity: daily exercise. He emphasizes that consistent physical activity can help individuals live longer, even those who are obese or face other health challenges. While traditional advice often highlights weight control, cholesterol management, and maintaining healthy blood pressure, Dr. Scharffenberg explains that these alone do not guarantee a long life. Instead, he stresses that daily movement plays a more critical role in extending lifespan, improving circulation, enhancing mental clarity, boosting immune function, and preserving muscle strength with age. His insights offer a fresh perspective on longevity, showing that small, consistent lifestyle habits—like exercising every day—can profoundly impact overall health, resilience against disease, and the quality of life not just physically, but emotionally and cognitively well into old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How daily exercise becomes the ultimate secret to longer, healthier life; doctor reveals&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an Instagram post by LongevityXlab on August 25, Dr. Scharffenberg emphasized the importance of daily physical activity. He said, “We need to exercise every day. That’s very important. I have outlived my two brothers, 13 and 17 years respectively. And each year I survive adds to that number.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective highlights that longevity is not merely about genetics or body weight, but about consistent, daily habits that strengthen the body and improve resilience against disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Scharffenberg explained a striking example from his own experience: he once spoke to a woman assisting him with PowerPoint presentations. Though she was obese, he encouraged her to focus on daily movement. He shared,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You should understand that being overweight increases the risk of dying from almost every disease we know. But here’s the good news: even if you are obese, exercising every day will help you live longer than a person of normal weight who does not exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statement underscores a critical point for longevity and preventive health: daily exercise can mitigate risks associated with obesity, hypertension, smoking, and high cholesterol, potentially extending life expectancy significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How exercise protects against disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Scharffenberg’s guidance aligns with extensive research showing that regular physical activity strengthens cardiovascular health, improves metabolism, reduces inflammation, and boosts mental resilience. Even small daily routines, such as walking, stretching, or light resistance exercises, can have a profound impact over time, especially when paired with balanced nutrition, adequate hydration, and quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasizes that the benefits are cumulative. Individuals who consistently move their bodies every day tend to experience lower rates of chronic illness and enhanced overall vitality, regardless of other risk factors or genetic predispositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical tips for incorporating daily exercise&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those looking to follow Dr. Scharffenberg’s advice, simple strategies can help make exercise a consistent habit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Begin with manageable activities like brisk walking, cycling, or yoga.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Schedule at least 20–30 minutes of movement daily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on variety to engage different muscle groups and maintain interest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pair exercise with proper nutrition and adequate sleep for maximum longevity benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By integrating exercise into your daily routine, even individuals with obesity or other health challenges can improve lifespan and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/barack-obama-meets-102-year-old-woman-her-simple-food-secrets-go-viral-inspiring-millions-with-longevity-lessons-and-life-tips/articleshow/124084018.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Barack Obama meets 102-year-old woman: HER simple food secrets go viral, inspiring millions with longevity lessons and life tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 04:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgJBVV95cUxQckFqLU5Wcm9DNDJ4TWh1bmNCc2huZUFsWVdzdFhHdjJGcVVzMUEzRTFlN05PNXVveHBfZFVhS25IRWxCMENQeURVZF9CNEpEcm1wQ29saHJBWGFHMU5YeWRXRmNYaFRCWExxN2o2c0hOay1Hb3pnU1NvVWplRC14SDUzd2F4X2dMUHUwck9vMndlMkhzYl9ITEttWkdXRE40dVFnbXRERklGLTBKSGl4M1h3TVh5WWFrX1pLaFlva1lDcURBNS01bm9SYlpzUjFxVWlzTFpBeUp3OF9LcEJaYnE2Z3RuN2lybk9CVWl6TmFqZHg2VTRjd0Y2NG1KeWlXS2NkMk9STVBIYWwtWEpldlVLQkh3OXJTeTM5c3NMSnA5VzBva19HN0xKRmNrOU04aFdiRGx3</guid></item><item><title>每天喝半茶匙这种油和温水可以改善记忆力-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/having-half-teaspoon-of-this-oil-daily-with-warm-water-can-improve-memory/articleshow/124044482.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that a common kitchen ingredient, probably resting on your kitchen shelf, can reduce the risk of memory loss?

Opting extra virgin olive oil can provide maximum benefits as it has the highest levels of antioxidants and polyphenols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a warm glass of water and add half teaspoon (around 2.5 ml) of olive oil. Stir well and consume in the morning on an empty stomach or before meals if convenient. Remember, not occasional but only regular consumption has proven benefits of memory improvement. Avoid the use of very hot water, as it can damage polyphenols in the olive oil. This simple habit may also aid digestion, reduce inflammation, support heart health, and contribute to healthy aging when practiced consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

						&lt;p&gt;Person County leaders confirmed the county’s eighth
confirmed rabies case this year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Person County Animal Services and the Person County Health Department
are urging the public to take precautions after the latest incident involved a
racoon on Ridge Road in the Roxboro city limits.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The county could not confirm any human or domestic animal
contact with the raccoon.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a deadly virus that affects the brain and nervous
system.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Immediate medical attention is critical for humans. Rabies
is 100% preventable if treated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Delaying care can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;People are urged to remain vigilant and to protect their families
and pets.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;County leaders provided the following reminders:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Do not touch or approach wild animals or unfamiliar pets.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Monitor your surroundings when outdoors.  &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Keep children and pets supervised and away from
wildlife.  &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Ensure all pets are up to date on rabies vaccinations.
This is required by law and critical for their protection.  Rabies
vaccinations are given daily at the shelter during regular business hours, no
appointment necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/person-county-eighth-rabies-case-2025-roxboro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/person-county-eighth-rabies-case-2025-roxboro/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Avoid handling stray or injured animals, even seemingly
friendly animals.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• If you or someone you know is bitten or scratched by an
animal, or if a pet encounters a wild animal:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;o In urgent situations, call 911.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;o Seek emergency medical care immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;o Call Animal Control at 336-597-1741 or the Health
Department at 336-597-2204.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Signs of a rabid animal:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Aggressive or unusually friendly behavior&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Difficulty walking, staggering&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Foaming at the mouth&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Excessive drooling&lt;/p&gt;

The women all received their first screening invitation between 1991 and 2020 and were monitored for up to 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After taking into account social, economic, reproductive, and health-related factors, the researchers found almost one in three (32%) women did not attend their first mammogram appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Not attending a first screening was linked with a significantly higher risk of breast cancer death – 9.9 deaths per 1,000 women over 25 years – compared with seven in those screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These women were also less likely to attend subsequent screenings and were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage breast cancer than those who were screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In contrast, the 25-year breast cancer rate was similar between groups. This suggests that the higher death risk among those not attending a first appointment reflects delayed detection rather than increased incidence of the disease, the team said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers wrote: “First screening non-participants had a 40% higher breast cancer mortality risk than participants, persisting over 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If early screening behaviour is predictive of later stage diagnosis and mortality risk, it could provide a valuable opportunity to identify populations at high risk decades before adverse outcomes occur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Responding to the study &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj.r1893" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in a linked editorial&lt;/a&gt;, US researchers said the results showed attending a first appointment was about “far more than a short-term health check”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For most women, the first screening appointment is unlikely to result in a cancer diagnosis or signal any areas of concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But even just turning up and getting information about how to reduce their risk and what symptoms to look out for can act as “a long-term investment in breast health and survival”, the US researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Breast screening programme eligibility varies around the world. In England, women are invited for breast screening from the age of 50 up to the age of 71. All women should have received a first invitation for a mammogram by the age of 53.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The latest NHS data shows 70% of eligible women were up to date with breast screening as of March 2024, meaning almost one in three were not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Claire Rowney, the chief executive of the Breast &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Now charity, said “a worryingly high number of women” missed their first appointment. Urgent action was needed to ensure women were encouraged to get screened, and that it was easily accessible to all invited, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Separate research showed the annual global cancer death toll was forecast to rise by nearly 75% to 18.6m by 2050. New cases are expected to rise 61% in the next 25 years to 30.5m, according to the study &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01635-6/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A global team of researchers said the trend was mostly a result of population growth and an increasingly ageing population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But they also said 42% of cancer deaths were linked to risks that could be modified, including smoking, unhealthy diets, high blood sugar and exposure to toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In more hopeful news, it emerged on Wednesday that scientists have uncovered a target for drug treatments that could stop pancreatic cancer in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers looked into the most aggressive and most common form of this cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found in a series of experiments that blocking a protein, known as SPP1, could stop the spread of the cancer and increase survival time.

			&lt;p&gt;Specific combinations of microbes living in our mouths have been associated with one of the &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-pancreatic-cancer-is-the-most-lethal/"&gt;deadliest cancers&lt;/a&gt; in humans, suggesting good oral hygiene could do more than just save our teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is clearer than ever that brushing and flossing your teeth may not only help prevent periodontal disease but may also protect against  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="175029" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/oral-microbes-linked-increased-risk-pancreatic-cancer"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; cancer epidemiologist Richard Hayes from New York University (NYU).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"&gt;pancreas&lt;/a&gt; is an abdominal organ responsible for producing enzymes and hormones our bodies use to break down and absorb nutrients in our food. Though it rarely develops tumors, those who do develop the disease face a tragically low chance of surviving in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-signal-of-a-silent-killer-cancer-may-hide-in-your-poop"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Early Warning Signal of a 'Silent Killer' Cancer May Hide in Your Poop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes, NYU epidemiologist Yixuan Meng, and colleagues used health records and oral wash samples collected through two studies involving more than 300,000 individuals aged in their fifties to seventies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considered collectively, 27 microbes identified in the mouth washes were linked to more than triple the risk of pancreatic cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/about/key-statistics.html"&gt;a disease that strikes&lt;/a&gt; 1 in 56 men and about 1 in 60 women in the US at some point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's findings, together with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MPA.0000000000002143"&gt;past research&lt;/a&gt;, suggest some of our mouth's microbes may be accessing the pancreas by travelling into the digestive system through our saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified three species of mouth bacteria in particular (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis"&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eubacterium_nodatum"&gt;Eubacterium nodatum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvimonas_micra"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parvimonas micra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and a common skin and gut fungus, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_tropicalis"&gt;Candida tropicalis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, that were linked with the increased chance of a pancreatic cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes cautions that while this doesn't necessarily mean the microbes they identified cause cancer directly, the patterns they observed highlight species that warrant further investigation. What's more, other &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; and bacterial species were associated with a decreased risk of cancer, suggesting the precise make-up of oral microflora is critical for our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers puzzled out the microbe patterns using data from two long-term health studies in America: the &lt;a href="https://prevention.cancer.gov/research-areas/networks-consortia-programs/plco"&gt;Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.10197"&gt;American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 445 of the participants in these studies developed pancreatic cancer. Their data was compared to 445 healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A bacteriome-wide scan revealed eight oral bacteria associated with decreased and 13 oral bacteria associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer," the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.3377"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer survival rate is just &lt;a href="https://pancan.org/facing-pancreatic-cancer/about-pancreatic-cancer/survival-rate/"&gt;13 percent at five years&lt;/a&gt;, often due to late diagnosis. Symptoms don't usually reveal themselves until the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-signal-of-a-silent-killer-cancer-may-hide-in-your-poop"&gt;disease is at an advanced stage&lt;/a&gt;, so understanding early risk factors, like mouth microbiome composition, could aid earlier detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By profiling bacterial and fungal populations in the mouth, oncologists may be able to flag those most in need of pancreatic cancer screening," &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/oral-microbes-linked-increased-risk-pancreatic-cancer"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; NYU epidemiologist Jiyoung Ahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team aims to examine how  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="175029" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; also contribute to these risks next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.3377"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

That simple idea sits behind a growing fitness trend: walking backward, sometimes called “retro walking.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not about showing off at the track. It’s about sharpening how you think while you move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have reported that when people walk backward, activity in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/prefrontal-cortex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; rises. That area handles decision-making, problem-solving, logic, and working memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study, participants didn’t even have to get up. They sat still and only visualized walking backward – yet they improved their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-brain-fastball-test-spots-alzheimers-disease-signs-in-just-minutes/"&gt;memory test&lt;/a&gt; scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-retro-walking-and-the-brain"&gt;Retro walking and the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline is a major concern in the geriatric population, with physical exercise being a well-established intervention for cognitive preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study from &lt;a href="https://www.dsu.edu.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dayananda Sagar University&lt;/a&gt; focused on older adults and cognition. The team recruited 36 participants aged 65 to 75. They trained three times a week for six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each supervised session lasted 30 minutes and used four-minute retro walking sets with five-minute rest intervals. The group walked backward on a flat surface at a steady pace to prevent falls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intensity increased gradually as confidence and skill improved. Participants were also encouraged to continue training at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (&lt;a href="https://mocacognition.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MoCA&lt;/a&gt;) to measure change. That screening tool scores from 0 to 30 and spans memory, attention, language, and executive functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end, the average rose by almost three points, from 25 (pretest) to 27.7 (posttest). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A score of 25 indicates that further assessment may be required and may reflect mild cognitive impairment, a possible precursor to dementia. A score of 27 or higher is considered normal or healthy with no signs of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/doctors-say-this-lifestyle-factor-smoking-is-biggest-contributor-to-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-making-the-brain-work-harder"&gt;Making the brain work harder&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The significant improvement in MoCA scores from pre-test to post-test suggests that retro walking positively influences &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cardiorespiratory-fitness-linked-to-greater-cognitive-performance/"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has indicated that engaging in dual-task exercises, such as walking while maintaining balance, stimulates cognitive processing and enhances &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/executive-function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;executive function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Retro-walking demands increased attention and coordination, potentially explaining the observed cognitive improvements,” the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to doctors at &lt;a href="https://www.ucla.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;, “The precise connection between retro walking and improved cognition is not yet clear. However, researchers suspect that the increased complexity of the physical aspects of the process somehow support the data processing centers of the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That perspective fits what many trainers see in practice: when a task requires balance, orientation, and foot placement, the brain steps up its control systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding a novel pattern – like moving backward – keeps you alert without needing fancy equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joint-health-and-retro-walking"&gt;Joint health and retro walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies report that backward walking can strengthen back and ankle muscles, improve hamstring strength and flexibility, enhance balance, posture, and coordination, and ease lower-back pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the knees and hips move through a smaller range of motion, retro walking can be easier on those joints. These mechanical shifts change how forces travel through the legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing direction alters co-contraction patterns in the quadriceps and hamstrings and can reduce compressive stress under the kneecap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result can be less irritation while still getting the benefits of steady movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-knee-osteoarthritis-trial"&gt;Inside the knee osteoarthritis trial&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A randomized controlled trial examined adults with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507884/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;knee osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. The team recruited 68 people and divided them at random into three groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone received a standard physiotherapy program with familiar strengthening moves – straight-leg raises, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/standing-still-exercises-beat-running-for-blood-pressure-control/"&gt;isometric&lt;/a&gt; quadriceps squeezes, and semi-squats – plus a brief ultrasound warm-up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One group added backward walking. One group added forward walking. A control group did physiotherapy only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training ran three days a week for six weeks. Each session included a warm-up, 10 minutes of supervised walking at a comfortable speed, and a cooldown. If pain stayed low, participants could build toward 30 minutes across the six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers tracked four outcomes before and after: knee pain on a 0–10 scale; function with the &lt;a href="https://www.sralab.org/rehabilitation-measures/western-ontario-and-mcmaster-universities-osteoarthritis-index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WOMAC questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; (lower scores indicate better function); quadriceps strength measured with a handheld dynamometer; and performance on the Timed Up and Go test (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/media/pdfs/steadi-assessment-tug-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TUG assessment&lt;/a&gt;) – standing up, walking about 10 feet, turning, walking back, and sitting down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-positive-study-results"&gt;Positive study results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All groups improved. The backward-walking group moved ahead of the control group on several measures. They cut pain scores more than the control group and also showed larger gains in function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retro walking group’s quadriceps strength increased by about one kilogram on dynamometer testing compared with the control group. They also shaved more time off the Timed Up and Go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall safety outcomes were favorable, as the retro walking team reported no serious adverse events. A few people in the forward-walking group noticed a mild uptick in pain, and therapists adjusted &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/time-in-nature-can-reshape-who-you-are-bring-inner-peace-eudaimonic-well-being/"&gt;walking time&lt;/a&gt; and exercise load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At six weeks, researchers found no statistically significant difference between backward and forward walking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That suggests adding regular, supervised walking – of either kind – to a solid therapy program can deliver meaningful benefits over physiotherapy alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also signals the need for longer or larger trials to determine whether backward walking offers an advantage beyond standard forward walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adding-retro-walking-to-your-routine"&gt;Adding retro walking to your routine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, retro walking requires attention and coordination, which is why it is believed to improve overall brain cognition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cognition study used a flat surface, a steady pace, and professional supervision to prevent falls, then increased intensity step by step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex responds when tasks demand planning and control. Backward walking is a simple way to add that demand to a daily routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MoCA shift from 25 to 27.7 shows how training can move someone from a score that flags possible mild cognitive impairment toward a range considered healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For joint health, altering direction changes the load on the knees and ankles while keeping you active. The osteoarthritis trial links that change to better function, less pain, stronger quadriceps, and faster get-up-and-go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no serious adverse events reported and flexible progression up to 30 minutes, the approach aligns with everyday therapy goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study details are easy to follow: flat surface, steady pace, gradual progression, short intervals, and consistent practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With those pieces in place, retro walking offers a safe, low-tech way to challenge the brain, fine-tune coordination, and keep the body moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full studies referenced in this article were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-019-2537-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.jmgumst.com/journalDetails/JMGUMST" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Mahatma Gandhi University of Medical Sciences and Technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 23:30:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOemZWeGhscXhzNlBXMU04LUVRaHByaUJCUVpXM2RTVE14YXRobmRidTN5T0dhbXBxVUxCWVFXYUFMbjdlcTU1Y3FMMlhxcmtXTlluSFNfVVluMTUxa1hUdVgxZnVfcFQ5dWoyYXQtVlVqNTRYcV9qU1FFcGhLRzVOYldmTVJyQ1FrcVJyZE1qLXN6TFgtX3N1Y0g0R29BdklBTW9ObDQ2M0FoSHM</guid></item><item><title>如何在华盛顿特区、马里兰州或弗吉尼亚州接种新冠疫苗，以及发生了哪些变化-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/09/24/covid-vaccine-dc-maryland-virginia/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="topper-text-elems" class="wpds-c-hoLCKW wpds-c-hoLCKW-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-topper" class="wpds-c-cBzrLX wpds-c-cBzrLX-cmVlgk-isCenterNS-false wpds-c-cBzrLX-iyHTpF-useUATStyles-true wpds-c-cBzrLX-ijmcQMb-css"&gt;&lt;h1 id="main-content" data-qa="headline" data-testid="headline" class="wpds-c-eRlesA wpds-c-eRlesA-dHdMuz-isOnSplitTopper-false wpds-c-eRlesA-bAbYzz-isStyle-false wpds-c-eRlesA-iPJLV-css"&gt;How to get covid vaccine in D.C., Maryland or Virginia, and what has changed&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p data-qa="subheadline" data-testid="subheadline" class="wpds-c-ckOSsQ wpds-c-ckOSsQ-iPJLV-css"&gt;D.C. and Maryland have made it easier for pharmacists to give covid shots without a prescription.

They were particularly vulnerable because their age meant they had a heightened risk of severe symptoms: pneumonia, brain infection, seizures or even death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Because they were all under the age of 1, none had been eligible to receive the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The state keeps a stock of post-exposure prophylactic globulin — a treatment that prevents infection&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;after measles exposure — in case a group of people ineligible to receive the vaccine, like the infants, is exposed, Mathis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;However, he added, the treatment must be administered within six days to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“We had until Sunday to get all those individuals and get them the treatment,” he said. “We definitely had to figure things out on the fly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;He said the babies’ families were all notified of the exposure by 10 p.m. Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Working with Intermountain Health and the state’s health department, Bear River health officials were able to offer a clinic Saturday, where nine of the infants’ families accepted the medicine, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The other two babies were referred to an emergency room, he said, to receive the treatment through an IV because of their size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“I view it as a great flow of communication, collaboration in order to help hopefully reduce the spread of the disease in our community,” Mathis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;As of Tuesday, Bear River spokesperson Estee Hunt said none of the babies was exhibiting any measles symptoms. If infected, symptoms typically develop within seven to 14 days, according to Utah health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Post-exposure treatment is limited&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Utah has now seen 41 officially confirmed measles cases this year, four of which were found in the Bear River district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Though the infants received post-exposure treatment, Mathis emphasized the MMR vaccine as a safe, preventative measure &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html"&gt;for those who are eligible.&lt;/a&gt; Pregnant people, for instance, are not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to Utah health officials, the vaccine is 97% effective for those who receive two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The state recommends children receive their first dose on or after their first birthday, and a second when they are 4 to 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The 11 babies who received post-exposure treatment will be on a delayed schedule for the MMR vaccine, Mathis said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Utah epidemiologist Dr. Leisha Nolen noted that while the state has a limited supply of post-exposure treatment that can be used on young infants, it may not have enough in the event of a mass exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 22:25:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE9zaGp0U1VKUWwwcUdpN1FvcVNaZEpnVUxGZUVUZkF1RzdxdXUzTGtiRG0xS2M3dzJpcm5LNjFOWXhwc0hFSFA3WE0wVGxiRG9mVW9odGR4Z282U1RFOEV2Sk92OFRLVUlweGJjVXZGdExFRzlnbWpCd0NEREQ</guid></item><item><title>ECTRIMS 2025 ：更新的麦当劳标准可实现更多MS诊断-今日多发性硬化症新闻</title><link>https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ectrims/2025/09/24/ectrims-2025-updated-mcdonald-criteria-allow-more-ms-diagnoses/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new revisions to the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-diagnosis-mcdonald-criteria/"&gt;McDonald criteria&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS) —  a set of guidelines long used to diagnose the neurodegenerative condition — have increased the proportion of people who can be diagnosed with MS and also allow for earlier diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s according to a new analysis by scientists at the Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia in Spain. The findings were presented by Luca Bollo, a neurologist specialist at the center, at the 41st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), held Sept. 24-26 in Barcelona, Spain, and online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bollo’s talk was titled “&lt;a href="https://distribute.congrex.com/from.storage?image=rqetJOF1YXChDh_STAPoNoChwtcDs07oiJx4d-yJB8_-yPXS6_nTFmPSvRfcbd7I0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Impact of the 2024 McDonald criteria revisions on multiple sclerosis diagnosis: a comparison with the 2017 criteria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS is a disorder marked by inflammation that damages healthy cells in the central nervous system (CNS), which comprises the brain and spinal cord. The McDonald criteria are guidelines used to &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnose MS&lt;/a&gt; based on clinical findings, imaging tests, and laboratory analyses. First published in 2001, the guidelines have been updated several times as scientific understanding of MS has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent update is the 2024 version, which was &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2025/09/18/new-mcdonald-criteria-aim-faster-ms-diagnosis-treatment/"&gt;just published last week&lt;/a&gt;. The 2024 revisions build upon those in a prior update, published in 2017. The aim is making the diagnosis of MS &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/09/25/ectrims-2024-mcdonald-criteria-changes-speed-diagnoses/"&gt;faster and more accurate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2024 updates include several notable changes, such as providing new guidance on interpreting certain imaging findings and biomarker data. A particularly important change, as noted by researchers, is that, in prior versions of the criteria, patients could only be diagnosed if they showed dissemination in time — meaning neurological damage occurring at multiple points in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new revisions, the McDonald criteria no longer require dissemination in time to diagnose MS if enough other signs of the disease are present. This means that patients may not have to wait several months or even years for new disease activity to occur to receive an MS diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2024 revisions to McDonald criteria widen scope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous version of the criteria also assessed neurological damage in just four key regions — three brain areas and the spinal cord. The 2024 update incorporates a fifth region: the optic nerves, which connect the eyes to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the 2024 revisions, MS can now be diagnosed without further testing if at least four of these five regions show disease-typical damage and the patient is experiencing MS-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, under the earlier McDonald criteria, MS could not be diagnosed if only one region showed damage. These newest revisions allow the diagnosis of MS in some situations when only one region is affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show how these changes may impact MS diagnoses moving forward, Bollo and colleagues looked at clinical data from 326 people who were evaluated for suspected MS at their center between January 2022 and March 2025. Among the patients, about two-thirds were female and the average age was 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our objective [was] to compare the impact of the 2017 and 2024 McDonald criteria in a cohort of patients [with] suspected MS, and to evaluate their effect on time to diagnosis,” Bollo said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these patients (73%) were being evaluated for MS because they had experienced an attack of symptoms that clinicians suspected might be an initial &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-flares/"&gt;MS flare&lt;/a&gt;. Of these patients, 74% met the 2024 criteria for a diagnosis of MS. Using the 2017 criteria, 59% of these individuals would have been diagnosed with MS, Bollo noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another 12% of the patients were being evaluated for MS because they’d been experiencing slowly worsening symptoms indicative of progressive MS. With the 2024 criteria, 83% of these patients were diagnosed with MS. According to Bollo, 57% would have been diagnosed with the 2017 criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining 15% of patients were being evaluated because MRI scans had revealed signs of MS-like damage — even though these individuals had no obvious symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2024 update notably includes several changes aimed at making it easier to diagnose MS in such situations. Slightly more than half of these patients were diagnosed with MS according to the latest criteria. Importantly, the analysis found that none of them could have been diagnosed according to the 2017 criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Significantly more patients can now get a definitive MS diagnosis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that every patient who met the 2024 criteria for MS could also be diagnosed according to the earlier 2017 criteria, but the reverse wasn’t true. Overall, significantly more patients could be definitively diagnosed according to the 2024 criteria (72% vs. 50%), the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical analyses revealed that patients evaluated according to the 2024 criteria were 42.7% more likely to be diagnosed with MS, and that the time to diagnosis was significantly faster, by about six months under the 2024 revisions as compared with the earlier 2017 criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bollo concluded that “the 2024 revisions to the McDonald criteria increase the proportion of patients diagnosed with MS by 43%” compared with the prior updates. The scientist also noted that, with these updates, the McDonald criteria “allowed for an earlier diagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that high consumption of soft drinks was linked to both a greater likelihood of major depressive disorder and more severe symptoms, particularly among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect appears tied to an increase in &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; bacteria, which have been linked to depression in earlier studies. These findings suggest nutrition-based interventions could play a role in preventing or treating depressive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender-Specific Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Women consuming sugary drinks had a 17% higher risk of depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbiome Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The bacterium &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; was more abundant in women with high intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Diet and probiotic strategies could help reduce depressive symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DZD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study involving the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD) provides strong evidence that sugary drinks affect not only metabolic but also mental health – especially in women. This effect is probably mediated by the sensitive microbiome of the intestine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is well known, people who regularly consume sugary drinks not only have an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. There is an increasing number of studies that are now showing that soft drinks can also affect mental health. So far, however, it was unclear whether there is a direct relation to major depressive disorder (MDD) and which biological processes might be involved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soft Drink Consumption Associated with Higher Risk of Depression&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, researchers analyzed cross-sectional data from the Marburg-Münster Affective Cohort (MACS). The study examined adults between the ages of 18 and 65 who were recruited from the general population and primary care between 2014 and 2018. The researchers included a total of 932 people, 405 of whom were patients with major depression disorder and 527 were healthy controls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyses showed a correlation between soft drink consumption and both the diagnosis of depression and the severity of the symptoms. This correlation was particularly pronounced in women: Among them, high consumption was associated with a 17% higher probability of depression (odds ratio 1.167) and more severe symptoms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes in the Microbiome as a Key Factor&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how could the effect be conveyed? Here, too, the study provides a possible explanation: In women who regularly drank sugary soft drinks, the researchers found a significantly increased number of bacteria of the &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; genus in the intestine. Earlier studies had shown that &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; is more common in people with depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study now provides the first convincing evidence that this bacterium possibly plays a mediating role – as a biological link between the consumption of soft drinks and the development of depressive symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data suggests that the relation between soft drinks and depressive symptoms arises via the influence of the microbiome,” says study leader Dr. Sharmili Edwin Thanarajah from the University Hospital Frankfurt and the MPI for Metabolism Research Cologne, an associated partner of the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary drinks such as cola or lemonade not only contain glucose and fructose, but also numerous additives – including preservatives and artificial sweeteners. This combination can disturb the delicate balance in the intestinal microbiome. Inflammation-promoting bacteria are favored, while the production of protective short-chain fatty acids decreases. Animal studies show that such changes can trigger inflammatory processes in the nervous system and thus increase depressive behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is striking that this correlation appears to be sex-related. In men who regularly consumed soft drinks, the researchers found neither an increase in &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; nor a correlation with depressive symptoms. It is still unclear why this effect only occurs in women. Hormonal differences or sex-related reactions of the immune system possibly play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Microbiome as a Therapeutic Target?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study results open up new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of depressive disorders,” comments DZD researcher Rachel Lippert from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbrücke (DIfE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microbiome-based approaches – such as targeted nutritional therapies or probiotic strategies – might help to effectively alleviate depressive symptoms in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers therefore argue that the influence of nutrition on mental health should be more strongly integrated into educational campaigns, care concepts and prevention programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Changes in the microbiome can be influenced by diet – and are therefore a potential therapeutic target,” explains Edwin. “Even small adjustments in consumer behavior might have a big impact – especially when considering the widespread consumption of soft drinks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and microbiome research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b0ded9d5c3d9ded7f0d4cad49dd5c69ed4d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Birgit Niesing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="ttpsw://dzd-ev.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DZD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Birgit Niesing – DZD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.2579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The bitter taste of sweet drinks: Increased consumption of soft drinks is linked to depression via gut microbiota alterations&lt;/a&gt;” by Sharmili Edwin Thanarajah et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bitter taste of sweet drinks: Increased consumption of soft drinks is linked to depression via gut microbiota alterations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soft drink consumption is linked to negative physical and mental health outcomes, but its association with major depressive disorder (MDD) and the underlying mechanisms remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the association between soft drink consumption and MDD diagnosis and severity and whether this association is mediated by changes in the gut microbiota, particularly &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hungatella&lt;/em&gt; abundance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This multicenter cohort study was conducted in Germany using cross-sectional data from the Marburg-Münster Affective Cohort. Patients with MDD and healthy controls (aged 18-65 years) recruited from the general population and primary care between September 2014 and September 2018 were analyzed. Data analyses were conducted between May and December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary analyses included multivariable regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models examining the association between soft drink consumption and MDD diagnosis and symptom severity, controlling for site and education, and &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hungatella&lt;/em&gt; abundance, controlling for site, education, and library size. Mediation analyses tested whether microbiota abundance mediated the soft drink–MDD link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 405 patients with MDD (275 female patients [67.9%]; mean [SD] age, 36.37 [13.33] years) and 527 healthy controls (345 female controls [65.5%]; mean [SD] age, 35.33 [13.13] years) were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soft drink consumption predicted MDD diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.081; 95% CI, 1.008-1.159; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .03) and symptom severity (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001; partial η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [ηp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;], 0.012; 95% CI, 0.004-0.035), with stronger effects in women (diagnosis: OR, 1.167; 95% CI, 1.054-1.292; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .003; severity: &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001; ηp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.036; 95% CI, 0.011-0.062).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In women, consumption was linked to increased &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .007; ηp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.017; 95% CI, 0.0002-0.068), but not &lt;em&gt;Hungatella&lt;/em&gt; abundance. Mediation analyses confirmed that &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt; significantly mediated the soft drink–MDD association (diagnosis: &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .011; severity: &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .005), explaining 3.82% and 5.00% of the effect, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this cohort study, it was found that soft drink consumption may contribute to MDD through gut microbiota alterations, notably involving &lt;em&gt;Eggerthella&lt;/em&gt;. Public health strategies to reduce soft drink intake may help mitigate depression risk, especially among vulnerable populations; in addition, interventions for depression targeting the microbiome composition appear promising.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 21:38:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5oajZ4a2FqeldiakplZzJCM1puU2huS1dHSU5XN0dxbE56WGtMX3h5ZVFreXExMmItZzd0SUhLeGpyWlZFa0ZzOHY0d21pbU84bjlWaFZBSm5mVWFVeDNpYVBrTWpPVzFqbk9DcWJNaw</guid></item><item><title>3例新的GA麻疹病例全部可追溯到去过GSU、餐厅、足球赛事的单个患者- WSB-TV</title><link>https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/3-new-ga-measles-cases-all-traced-back-single-patient-who-went-gsu-restaurant-soccer-event/YO2FOLLTGBF3NDFSDD6E6EWCYM/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="default__ArticleBody-sc-tl066j-1 jPcFTl article-body-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;ATLANTA — Georgia’s Department of Public Health has identified three new measles cases linked to a previous case from two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/3-new-measles-cases-confirmed-georgia/3SJ73LV6QBFC3PPOFHEGFIL25Y/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/3-new-measles-cases-confirmed-georgia/3SJ73LV6QBFC3PPOFHEGFIL25Y/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The recent outbreak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been traced back to a single patient who was present at several public locations, including Georgia State University and a local restaurant, earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Andrew Thornton, a physician at WellStar Urgent Care, emphasized the contagious nature of measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;“It’s about 90% contagious for someone who has not been vaccinated,” Thornton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more" class="taboola-read-more"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Jodie Guest from Emory University School of Public Health told &lt;b&gt;Channel 2’s Richard Elliot&lt;/b&gt; that vaccine distrust has increased significantly, but she insists the measles vaccine is safe for both children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED STORIES:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;“It’s never too late to get a vaccine for the measles because that’s your best form of protection,” Guest said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;Alice Burns, a mother in Decatur, expressed her commitment to vaccinating her two-year-old son, Walter, to ensure his safety and the safety of others who cannot be vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more-8" class="taboola-read-more-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;“We were happy to get it as soon as, you know?

Suffered by an estimated 21million Americans, the condition raises the risk of death from heart attack or stroke and is the leading cause of preventable limb amputations in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients do not have noticeable symptoms in the early stages, however, and often dismiss signs like discomfort, fatigue or pain in the legs as signs of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when the disease progresses, doctors warned Daily Mail that patients may have sores on the toes or feet that do not heal or only heal slowly, a warning sign of the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Mounir Haurani, a vascular surgeon at the Society for Vascular Surgery, told this website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 'This is one of the signs of more advanced disease, and indicates a worsening limb-threatening problem such as developing tissue loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'These sores will often&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; start off as a small blister, but then progress into a crater or ulcer where the skin is open and there is exposed soft tissue underneath. It may be a pink or yellowish crater.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He added: 'They are often present on the nailbed and end of the toe, but the other place that people can have them is on the pads of the toes or foot.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About one in 20 Americans suffer from the condition, estimates suggest, but three in four do not realize they have the disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors are warning patients to be on the lookout for subtle changes in their feet that could indicate peripheral artery disease (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It tends to be diagnosed among those over 65 years old, with people who have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity or who smoke being most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among patients, about 33 percent die within five years, estimates suggest, while 20 percent experience a heart attack or stroke and 150,000 suffer an amputation annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Haurani added: 'This disease is a very common problem in the US, and worldwide. It is a very large part of a vascular surgeon's practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Often, we do manage to see patients before the non-healing wounds are present, but in my practice, here in North Carolina, I tend to see this symptom more often.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the condition often does not trigger clear symptoms, in earlier stages, patients may lose hair on the lower leg and foot or that area may feel colder than other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors warn that the foot may also appear paler or have lighter, shinier skin, while the calf muscle may also thin over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, the condition can also cause burning or cramping sensations in the toes and feet, as well as pain in the leg while at rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors say early symptoms of the disease, like fatigue, can be shrugged off or mistaken for other signs like aging (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease progresses in two stages, with symptoms either advancing rapidly or taking months to move from early to late-stage warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat the disease, Dr Haurani said physicians may recommend lifestyle changes such as walking more, eating a healthy diet and quitting smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, patients will also be offered surgery to widen arteries and fully restore blood flow to the lower part of the foot and the leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients may also be prescribed statins and cholesterol-lowering medications to reduce the risk of clots forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Haurani added: 'We estimated 70 percent of Americans have never heard of this disease, so just knowing what it is and that it exists as a problem are the first steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But it is important to say that, despite the risks, it can be managed operatively and patients can live a long, happy and healthy life with the disease as long as it is managed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Celebrity Phylicia Rashad, who played a leading role in The Cosby Cowboys, spoke publicly in 2007 about the impact the disease had on her family, saying she had eight family members, including her father and grandparents, who were diagnosed with the disease. Each died from a heart attack or a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease differs from varicose vein insufficiency, which President Donald Trump was diagnosed with, because peripheral artery disease affects the arteries rather than the veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Haurani said it was possible to prevent the disease via walking just 20 to 30 minutes per day, eating a healthy diet and avoiding smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The revelation came amid Peripheral Artery Disease Awareness Month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 21:25:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPOTRHWFJXbk0xLUk0dDVRZmFXb2ZkbXJnOXltUlR0SUt3TFJ1OVF6OTVNNU1hY0ZEZVRxWXJMbnBnNFFUM0dYT093WGZGSDZwV3ZXUElEbkIzRWx2V2ZoTjN6dktxdDdyenBLV2xfN1UyazNkRHBQMkZibWJIM3lnNFFqbUs2elgzYTIxV012LVRKRGZrRkw0RDE0am12bVFuTnNwdi1B0gGrAUFVX3lxTE12UXpydUsyalJhb0ZHeXJqZmtTb000MmRIc1JhcE1UdEtzWDFQbnFxWlh5YWFGdjk4QUdHQXcxQm4zTF9MTkRIN3NfTThvenZRVEE0VlNoRm5laEZDLUlxekpib0xReEhnSEhYRWJ4WGRjR3NEa2ZoUkdyMzBNWVlqQmsyckdIeFdUTDJORzBZMU52UktLbjBFemlUejcydUQ1M2NIamNMY3J0Yw</guid></item><item><title>初步但有希望的基因治疗显示亨廷顿舞蹈症进展减少75% - ABC新闻-突发新闻、最新新闻和视频</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/preliminary-promising-gene-therapy-shows-75-reduction-huntingtons/story?id=125904128</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;A one-time gene therapy treatment has shown remarkable success in slowing the progression of Huntington's disease in a preliminary trial, according to a press release from &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/about"&gt;University College London (UCL).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The experimental treatment, called AMT-130, reduced disease progression by 75% over three years in patients who received a high dose, compared to those on standard care, according to researchers. While these early results are promising, they are preliminary and the treatment could still years away from potential FDA approval, with the earliest application expected in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This result changes everything," UCL professor Ed Wild said in the press release.

Children of affected parents have a 50% chance of inheriting the condition, according to the press release. The disease typically appears in mid-adulthood, causing problems with movement, memory, and mood, and usually progresses over 15-20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The new therapy works by using a harmless virus to deliver special genetic instructions to the brain, researchers said. These instructions help turn off the harmful protein that damages brain cells. Unlike current treatments that only manage symptoms, AMT-130 is designed to be a one-time treatment that lasts a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I am thrilled that this study showed statistically significant effects on disease progression," professor Sarah Tabrizi, lead scientific advisor for the trial at UCL, said in the announcement. She added that the treatment could help patients "preserve daily function and keep them working longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study included 29 patients, with 12 receiving a high dose of the drug over three years. Scientists measured the treatment's success through brain scans and by testing spinal fluid for signs of brain cell damage, which showed significant improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;While the results are encouraging, experts caution that larger studies are needed. The treatment requires complex brain surgery to deliver the therapy directly to affected areas. Despite this challenge, researchers reported that patients tolerated the procedure well with manageable side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If approved, AMT-130 would become the first treatment to actually slow down Huntington's disease rather than just treat its symptoms. However, the path to FDA approval typically takes several years of additional testing and review to ensure both safety and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The findings haven't yet been published in a medical journal and have not yet been vetted by other medical experts but will be presented at a major medical conference next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 21:24:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
