						Near the end of his reign, French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte led an army of over half a million men in an invasion of Russia in 1812. Six months later, after the army was forced to retreat, an estimated tens of thousands of his soldiers made it back to France.Known as one of the costliest wars in history, the death of hundreds of thousands of soldiers has been attributed to battle, as well as starvation, cold and a typhus epidemic that broke out.Now, researchers have found evidence in the DNA remains of the soldiers that there may have been multiple diseases that devastated the army, including two previously undetected types of bacteria. The study was published Friday in the journal Current Biology.“Previously, we just thought that there was one infectious disease that decimated the Napoleon army — the typhus,” said lead author Rémi Barbieri, a former postdoctoral fellow at the Institut Pasteur in Paris who currently holds a postdoctoral position at Estonia’s University of Tartu. Instead, the researchers found something unexpected, opening the door to potentially uncovering other infectious diseases that could have contributed to the soldiers’ deaths, he added.The researchers found the pathogens — Salmonella enterica and Borrelia recurrentis, bacteria that cause paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever, respectively — by analyzing teeth from the fallen soldiers who were found in a mass grave uncovered in 2001 in Vilnius, Lithuania.The new findings not only give a clearer picture of a significant historical event, but they highlight how technology has advanced and opened the door to understanding historical circumstances, researchers say.Mixing pot of diseaseWhen Napoleon and his troops reached Moscow, they weren’t met with Russian soldiers. Instead, the city was abandoned, with burnt crops and no supplies available, such as safe food to eat or clean clothing. As the harsh winter months approached, the French army was forced to retreat, but not without facing many hardships.Rickettsia prowazekii, the bacterium responsible for typhus, was first detected in the teeth of Napoleon’s soldiers during a 2006 study, but the research was limited by the technology at that time. To find out if typhus was the sole culprit for the demise of soldiers, the authors of the new study used a method known as high-throughput sequencing, which can sequence millions of DNA fragments at a time. It allows for highly degraded DNA to be identified, such as the genome fragments extracted from samples more than 200 years old.“This is something that can be only done with these machines that are very powerful to go and sequence a lot of high quantity of DNA,” said study coauthor Nicolás Rascovan, supervisor of the research and head of the Microbial Paleogenomics Unit at the Institut Pasteur. “This sort of analysis, these kinds of projects, can really give a much clearer picture about the landscape of infectious disease in the past … and how (historical events) have also shaped the landscape of infectious diseases today.”The study authors looked at 13 samples and found no traces of typhus, but their work does not discredit the findings of the 2006 study, the researchers noted. The study sample is also too small to know the exact impact the diseases had on Napoleon’s army. “What changes (with) our study is the fact that now we have direct evidence there were several different infectious diseases present in this site,” Rascovan said. It is likely that more diseases were at play that have yet to be detected, he added.Cecil Lewis, an ancient DNA researcher who studies the human microbiome, said the results were not particularly surprising, but he called it a meaningful contribution to “our understanding of the demise of Napoleon’s army.” Lewis, vice president of academics at the Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics, was not involved with the study.“We are now in a period where ancient DNA studies can contribute more nuance to the understanding of such historic events, which is exciting,” Lewis said in an email. “Studying historical and ancient pathogens, their place in history, offers a glimpse into the evolutionary paths organisms have taken, some now extinct, others forming the foundation of present-day pathogens. These data help us better understand the possibilities for how pathogens can impact lives, evolve, and persist, which is crucial for anticipating and managing future threats.”Paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever are still around today, but are not as common or as deadly. Napoleon survived the retreat, but his dwindling army ultimately contributed to his fall from power a few years later.“Something that is quite impressive is how, in so little time, since 2006 with the first study to today, the technologies have been developed so much that we can do things that were impossible to even conceive a few years ago and now are possible,” Rascovan said. “So I am very excited to think what is going to be next in terms of technological developments.”

Their discovery combines near-infrared LED light with nanoscopic flakes of tin oxide, known as &lt;a href="https://utaustinportugal.org/"&gt;SnOx nanoflakes&lt;/a&gt;, to kill &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/cancer-cell-8247"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; while leaving healthy ones unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-suggests-covid-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer-too"&gt;Study Suggests COVID MRNA Vaccines Help Fight Cancer Too&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178822" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178822" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LEDSystemActivatesSnOxNanoflakesToNeutraliseCancerCell.jpg" alt="Illustration of LED system used to fight cancer" class="wp-image-178822 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LEDSystemActivatesSnOxNanoflakesToNeutraliseCancerCell.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LEDSystemActivatesSnOxNanoflakesToNeutraliseCancerCell-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178822" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers' custom near-infrared LED heating system activates SnOx nanoflakes that heat and neutralize cancer cells (green: live cells; red: cells killed by photothermal therapy). (&lt;a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2025/10/09/led-light-blasts-cancer-cells-and-spares-healthy-ones/"&gt;The University of Texas at Austin&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks an important advance in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40169560/"&gt;photothermal therapy&lt;/a&gt;, a technique that uses light to heat and destroy tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the process relies on inexpensive, accessible LED systems rather than specialized lasers. The approach reduces damage to surrounding tissues and could one day offer a safer and less invasive alternative &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/chemotherapy-588"&gt;to chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/radiation-therapy-39517"&gt;or radiotherapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of the innovation is a simple concept: using light to create localized heat that targets and kills cancer cells. The team designed the SnOx nanoflakes to absorb near-infrared light efficiently, a wavelength that can safely penetrate biological tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When illuminated, these nanoflakes act like microscopic heaters, producing enough warmth to disrupt cancer cell membranes and proteins, ultimately causing cell death. Healthy tissues remain largely unaffected because they are less sensitive to heat and because the nanoflakes can be directed specifically toward malignant cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-020-0410-2"&gt;targeted heating process&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02140-y"&gt;photothermal therapy&lt;/a&gt;, relies on a physical rather than chemical mechanism. This means it can avoid many of the systemic side effects typically seen with chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional photothermal systems use lasers because they can focus light precisely deep within tissue. However, that same intensity can also damage healthy cells, requires costly equipment, and limits use to highly specialized facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers replaced lasers with light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which emit a gentler, broader spectrum of light. LEDs produce more uniform heating and are far less likely to burn or harm healthy tissue. They are also inexpensive and portable, making them well suited for clinical or even at-home use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.5c03135"&gt;laboratory studies&lt;/a&gt;, the LED light combined with SnOx nanoflakes destroyed up to 92 percent of skin cancer cells and 50 percent of colorectal cancer cells within 30 minutes. Healthy human skin cells were unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This level of selectivity makes the technique particularly promising for cancers such as melanoma and basal cell carcinoma, which can be treated directly through light exposure. Such precision is rare among photothermal technologies, which often risk harming surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underlying science is equally significant. Tin oxide is a stable, biocompatible material already used in electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By converting tin disulfide (SnS₂) into oxygenated tin oxide nanoflakes, the researchers created structures that absorb near-infrared light much more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This transformation improves photothermal performance and allows the nanoflakes to be made using water-based, non-toxic synthesis methods. The process avoids harmful solvents and expensive manufacturing steps, making it scalable, sustainable and suitable for medical applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team envisions compact LED devices that could be applied directly to the skin after surgical tumor removal to destroy any remaining malignant cells and reduce the risk of recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, after removing a melanoma or basal cell carcinoma, a patch-like LED device could deliver focused light to activate the nanoflakes at the surgical site. This type of portable, home-based treatment could make post-surgical cancer care safer, more convenient and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40170176/"&gt;less dependent&lt;/a&gt; on hospital visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The innovation also opens the door to combination therapies. Photothermal treatment can make cancer cells more vulnerable to other forms of therapy, such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9760263/"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452262725000285"&gt;targeted drugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat generated by light can weaken tumor cells, make their membranes more permeable and trigger immune responses that help the body identify and destroy cancer. Integrating LED-based photothermal therapy with other approaches could make treatment plans more precise, effective and less toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although still in the early stages, the researchers are refining the technology and exploring new applications. They are studying how different wavelengths and exposure times affect outcomes and investigating whether other materials similar to tin oxide could reach deeper tissues, such as those affected by breast or colorectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area of development is implantable nanoflake systems: tiny biocompatible devices that could provide ongoing photothermal control inside the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential for accessibility is one of the most exciting aspects of this work. Because LED-based devices are inexpensive to manufacture and simple to operate, they could be used in low-resource regions where access to cancer care is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38571427/"&gt;This could democratize&lt;/a&gt; advanced treatment by extending it beyond major hospitals. For superficial cancers detected early, LED therapy might even be incorporated into outpatient or cosmetic procedures, reducing recovery time and improving quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety is another major advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy damages rapidly dividing healthy cells across the body, and radiotherapy can harm normal tissue and cause fatigue or scarring. Photothermal therapy, by contrast, confines its effects to the illuminated site. It produces no systemic toxicity, no cumulative organ damage and minimal discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This high &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx6350"&gt;precision&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40802759/"&gt;stems&lt;/a&gt; from both the optical targeting and the biological selectivity of the nanoflakes, which preferentially heat cancer cells due to their altered metabolism and greater sensitivity to thermal stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to translate these laboratory findings into preclinical and, eventually, human trials. While much work remains, LED-driven photothermal therapy could represent a shift in how we treat cancer, making therapies more precise, affordable and humane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light, one of nature's simplest energies, could become a powerful medical tool for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8002224/"&gt;selectively destroying tumors&lt;/a&gt; without harming healthy tissue. With innovations such as SnOx nanoflakes, the vision of non-invasive, localized, patient-friendly cancer treatment is coming steadily closer to reality.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267556/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

"We've known about magnesium and its benefits for years and now, finally, it's mainstream."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;I can almost hear the eye roll when I contact Kirsten Jackson, a dietitian who specialises in gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Clever marketing schemes," Ms Jackson says, "magnesium is involved in areas people are willing to invest in: their sleep, digestion, mental health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But, she is keen to stress, this does not automatically mean we need supplements to improve those things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Magnesium is one of several minerals in our bodies. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/others/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;The recommended daily amount&lt;/a&gt; for women is 270mg and for men, it's 300mg. We store about 25g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It might make up less than 1% of us but "it is involved in over 300 different processes", Ms Jackson explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It is "especially important for our brain and mood," she says, because it helps nerves send messages properly and supports the building blocks of brain cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It also helps balance blood sugar levels, regulate blood pressure, and is an essential player in moving calcium and potassium in and out of our cells, which maintains the rhythm of our heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So, surely popping a pill full of the stuff should keep our bodies running smoothly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's more complex than that, says Ms Jackson. For a magnesium supplement to work, we need to be lacking the mineral in the first place - and it's difficult to test for any deficiency because the vast majority of our magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But on an individual level, many say the supplement has made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Katie Curran Katie Curran, a woman with green eyes, with blonde shoulder length hair " class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Katie Curran&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Katie says magnesium supplements have helped improve her sleep and calmed her racing thoughts&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For Katie Curran, a communications specialist who has worked with some of the biggest fashion brands, sleeping well was something she could only dream about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"A year ago, I was struggling," she confides. "It would take so long to get to sleep, my brain was racing, and then I would get off only to wake a couple of hours later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Katie decided to try magnesium glycinate - a combination of magnesium and glycine, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-023-00970-8" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;an amino acid with limited evidence &lt;/a&gt;linking it to better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;After two weeks of taking 270mg a day, she says the noise in her head started to quieten. The racing thoughts slowed down, and she began to feel like she could function again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"My sleep definitely improved, I had more energy. I became more active. Other things changed in my life, so I can't put it down to just one thing, but I think the magnesium supplements were an important part of the puzzle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;While being deficient in magnesium can definitely affect sleep patterns, there isn't the evidence to say taking supplements will definitely improve your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Social media is awash with eager supplement-takers, many with posts stamped with "commission paid" in the corner - meaning they could earn money from their story or reel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;According to these influencers, it feels as though there is little magnesium can't help with, as they recommend a variety of different products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Magnesium is often mixed with other compounds with the aim of helping support various parts of our bodies. For example, magnesium mixed with either L-threonate or glycinate is supposed to target brain health, which helps with sleep and stress relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If magnesium is combined with chloride, it is recommended for muscle tension and pre-menstrual cramps, while citrate and oxide blends are aimed at digestion and help with constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt; The majority of us can probably relate to having at least one of those issues. But as nutritionist Kristen Stavridis stresses, the problem is there is not enough strong evidence to show the majority of these different magnesium supplements have a positive effect on the healthy population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And even if they did - we would need to be deficient in magnesium in the first place to see a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We have supplement companies shouting out at us: 'We are all going to die'," Ms Stavridis says, "'Quick! Take my pill and - hey presto - there's your solution'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Many of us are not getting enough magnesium," she continues, "around 10% of men and 20% of women are not getting the&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6060686/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt; recommended daily intake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"But just taking a supplement is not the answer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Seeds, nuts, whole grain breads, greens and fruit images" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Seeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are all rich in magnesium&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Take sleep health, for example. Ms Stavridis says there are many conflicting studies on whether magnesium supplements really make a difference. Some trials say it can have some benefits, while some randomised controlled trials - the gold standard - are more sceptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There is also the added complication of supplements potentially working against each other because of the way they interact in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Taking zinc, for example - a supplement often recommended for peri-menopausal women - can also &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#:~:text=Absorption%20of%20magnesium%20from%20different,in%20the%20body%20%5B17%5D" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;affect the absorption rate of magnesium.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Basically, Ms Stavridis says, it's a minefield, and not just a simple case of "take this" and you'll be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She recommends looking at diet first. But if you are thinking about taking magnesium supplements, Ms Stavridis advises taking half the amount recommended on the packet on a daily basis and seeing how you feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If healthy people take too much, their kidneys can get rid of it in "expensive urine", but there are still risks, like diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For those with kidney disease, taking magnesium supplements can be dangerous and can cause hypermagnesemia - a potentially life-threatening condition that can leave someone with paralysis or in a coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dietitian Kirsten Jackson also says most people should "100% look at diet first".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Foods like seeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are good sources of magnesium, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She warns that if you don't regularly consume these types of foods, you're probably also short of other essential nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin K, fibre and prebiotics too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"One magnesium supplement is not going to sort all that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 23:04:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE15alhGbkRDMVlYZnExZ2l4N0xqWUtnWGhENmJkUWFsNi1XQXBQNTJJd284U1VWeDI4ZUExLXpuTEJGWkEzZmo2eDQ2b19hUmhMZmFHQjE0V05KZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE8waXVSS3lVTFgyZE9WOU91OU9uSG1HcXEyOGNydFBUOElXUGpBaENhOVEzQ09xNnVpLWx2cWhtcWt2eTRYSUZMUnJJQnFIcUluckpMNnV5UlBvWmxzVWhn</guid></item><item><title>黄金猎犬小狗被挫败的拥抱兄弟的尝试充满了最可爱的愤怒-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-puppys-thwarted-attempt-220000851.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When we all think of Golden Retrievers, most of us picture sweet, easygoing dogs that don't have a mean bone in their bodies, and that's usually the case.

&lt;h2&gt;Deadly doses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supplements were: &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/public-notification-artri-king-contains-hidden-drug-ingredients"&gt;Artri King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/nhan-sam-tuyet-lien-truy-phong-hoan-may-be-harmful-due-hidden-drug-ingredients"&gt;Nhan Sam Tuyet Lien&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/public-notification-linsen-double-caulis-plus-lingxianshuangtengsu-contains-hidden-drug-ingredient"&gt;Linsen Double Caulis Plus&lt;/a&gt;. All are known to contain unlisted glucocorticoids, according to the Food and Drug Administration. And testing of two of the man’s supplements by the hospital confirmed the presence of the steroids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors determined that the man had essentially overdosed on the glucocorticoids—he had taken doses that exceeded the normal levels of glucocorticoids in the body. The steroids likely suppressed immune responses, leading to his infections and GI ulcers. But, more significantly, the excess steroid levels also caused his HPA axis to essentially shut down. While it’s possible to get the HPA axis back up and running after withdrawal from excessive steroid use, the amount of time that takes can vary. Further, if a person stops taking large doses of glucocorticoids abruptly, rather than gradually—as in the man’s case—and particularly after chronic use—also as in the man’s case—it can lead to an &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000357.htm"&gt;adrenal crisis&lt;/a&gt;. In retrospect, the man had all the signs of a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors started treating him with hydrocortisone (medication cortisol) to get him out of danger. But it took six weeks before his HPA axis showed signs of recovery on tests. By that time, he had developed recurrent bacterial infections in his blood and had persistent delirium. It was only after several months in the hospital that he was able to be discharged back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the doctors describe the man’s case as a cautionary tale. Many Americans use supplements, but their efficacy is largely unproven, and they are not rigorously regulated for safety. And even though, in this case, the FDA had issued warnings specifically about the three supplements the man took, his case highlights that public awareness of such dangers remains low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clinicians must remain vigilant in assessing supplement use and educate patients on potential risks, particularly regarding hidden glucocorticoids, to prevent serious health complications such as adrenal insufficiency,” the doctors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="comment"&gt;&lt;div class="commtext c00"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From OpenEvidence.com:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After ingestion, bismuth is primarily found in trace amounts within organs such as the kidney, liver, spleen, and, in rare cases, the brain, where it accumulates intracellularly—especially in lysosomes and nuclear membranes—and extracellularly in basement membranes of blood vessels.[1-4] In normal therapeutic use, the amount of tissue-bound bismuth is extremely low and is not associated with adverse effects.
Potential consequences of tissue-bound bismuth are generally negligible at standard doses, but chronic or excessive exposure can lead to toxicity, most notably neurotoxicity (bismuth encephalopathy).[1][4-6] In cases of bismuth intoxication, histochemical studies have shown accumulation in neurons and glial cells, particularly in the cerebellum, thalamus, and hippocampus, with clinical manifestations including confusion, myoclonus, and encephalopathy.[1][4-6] However, these effects are reversible upon discontinuation of bismuth exposure, and recovery is typically complete within weeks.[5-6]
Animal studies confirm that bismuth binds to proteins such as ferritin and metallothionein, and is retained in lysosomes, nuclear membranes, and myelin-associated proteins.[2][4][7] The kidney is the primary site of accumulation and excretion, and tissue levels decline after cessation of exposure, with little evidence of permanent retention at therapeutic doses.[2-3]
In summary, permanent tissue binding of bismuth is minimal and clinically insignificant with standard use, but chronic high-dose exposure can result in neurotoxicity and other organ effects, which are reversible after stopping bismuth.[5-6][8-9]"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.

			&lt;p&gt;Superagers retain sharp minds into their 80s and beyond, defying the idea that cognitive decline is inevitable as we age. A 25-year study of these enviable few now reveals some of what's special about their underlying neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really what we've found in their brains that's been so earth-shattering for us," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/08/what-makes-a-superager"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Northwestern University clinical neuropsychologist Sandra Weintraub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weintraub and colleagues found superagers' brains are oddly resistant to the buildup of Alzheimer's-related protein clumps and tangles. These individuals also have a higher concentration of one specific type of neuron in a critical region of their brain, and exhibit less inflammatory activity in their &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"&gt;white matter&lt;/a&gt; compared to the general aging population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings need to be validated in other populations, identifying a distinct neurobiological profile in superagers "opens the door to new interventions aimed at preserving brain health well into the later decades of life," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/08/what-makes-a-superager"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Weintraub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;New Alzheimer's Treatment Clears Plaques From Brains of Mice Within Hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superagers have memories beyond their 80s that rival those of people in their 50s. This study defines them as capable of remembering at least 9 words out of a list of 15 when tested, which is typical of people at least two to three decades younger. Some studies have found that &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2017/04/scientists-have-discovered-why-some-people-are-super-agers/"&gt;less than five percent&lt;/a&gt; of the population can achieve a superager classification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/less-than-5-superagers-what-they-have-in-common-elderly-sharp-cognitive"&gt;High extroversion&lt;/a&gt; is one trait superagers have in common with each other. Oddly, superagers aren't &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/less-than-5-superagers-what-they-have-in-common-elderly-sharp-cognitive"&gt;necessarily leading healthier lifestyles&lt;/a&gt;, with some smoking and drinking alcohol regularly; a factor that suggests a significant component of these folks' age-resisting superpowers is biological.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178198" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178198" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/SuperagerWhoWasPartOfStudySitsWithWife-e1760929873749.jpg" alt="SuperAger Ralph Rehbock sits with his wife in his home.

(Shane Collins/Northwestern University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weintraub and team monitored 290 people aged 80 and older since 2000 to compare those who would turn out to be superagers with those who age typically. Thanks also to generous donations of 79 superager brains, the researchers identified some key biological differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we realized is there are two mechanisms that lead someone to become a superager," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/08/what-makes-a-superager"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Weintraub. "One is resistance: they don't make the plaques and tangles [typically associated with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="178196" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease]. Two is resilience: they make them, but they don't do anything to their brains."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells that deliver information to the hippocampus, known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entorhinal_cortex"&gt;entorhinal neurons&lt;/a&gt;, were larger in superagers, possibly contributing to this resistance or resilience, the researchers suggest in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178199" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DonatedSuperagerBrainBeingHeldInLab-e1760929713642.jpg" alt="Donated superager brain being held in lab" class="wp-image-178199 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178199" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Lab member holds a donated SuperAger brain. (Shane Collins/Northwestern University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, typically aging people had thinning in the outer brain layer, whereas superagers did not. This area of the brain governs our conscious thoughts, memory, and language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superagers also had more &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Economo_neuron"&gt;von Economo neurons&lt;/a&gt; and a thicker &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex"&gt;anterior cingulate gyrus&lt;/a&gt;, where these neurons are found, even compared to much younger people. This part of the brain is involved in regulating attention, emotion, and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superagers-with-incredible-memories-have-brains-like-25-year-olds"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; already noted that this part of the brain isn't shrinking as expected in superagers. Weintraub and team suspect superagers are born with a higher density of von Economo neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these differences seem to keep &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superagers-with-incredible-memories-have-brains-like-25-year-olds"&gt;superager brains quite stable&lt;/a&gt; compared to others over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178200" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/SuperAgerTakesCognitiveTestInLab-e1760929809691.jpg" alt="Superager from study takes cognitive test." class="wp-image-178200 size-full"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178200" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A superager takes a cognitive test in the lab. (Shane Collins/Northwestern University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many of the findings from this paper stem from the examination of brain specimens of generous, dedicated superagers who were followed for decades," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/08/what-makes-a-superager"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Northwestern University clinical neuropsychologist Tamar Gefen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also noted a list of genes highlighted by prior research that still could be investigated for further insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the genes that affect cognition as we age may allow us to create pharmaceuticals that promote superager brain settings and resistance to Alzheimer's disease, the researchers conclude in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70312"&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the technique being used here. In this case, the researchers placed the antibody genes in a circular loop of DNA called a plasmid. This is enough to ensure that the DNA doesn’t get digested immediately and to get the antibody genes made into proteins. But it does nothing to help get the DNA inside of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team, a mixture of people from a biotech company and academic labs, used a commercial injection setup that mixes the injection of the DNA with short pulses of electricity. The electricity disrupts the cell membrane, allowing the plasmid DNA to make it inside cells. Based on animal testing, doing this in muscle cells is enough to turn the muscles into factories producing lots of broadly neutralizing antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study was meant to test the safety of doing that in humans. The team recruited 44 participants, testing various doses of two antibody-producing plasmids and injection schedules. All but four of the subjects completed the study; three of those who dropped out had all been testing a routine with the electric pulses happening very quickly, which turned out to be unpleasant. Fortunately, it didn’t seem to make any difference to the production of antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there were a lot of adverse reactions, most of these were associated with the injection itself: muscle pain at the site, a scab forming afterward, and a reddening of the skin. The worst problem appeared to be a single case of moderate muscle pain that persisted for a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all but one volunteer, the injection resulted in stable production of the two antibodies for at least 72 weeks following the injection; the single exception only made one of the two. That’s “at least” 72 weeks because that’s when they stopped testing—there was no indication that levels were dropping at this point. Injecting more DNA led to more variability in the amount of antibody produced, but that amount quickly maxed out. More total injections also boosted the level of antibody production. But even the minimal procedure—two injections of the lowest concentration tested—resulted in significant and stable antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

But when they marched on Russia, French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's &lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;Grande Armee&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt; was doomed to failure and death, and not just on the battlefield.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Now&lt;/span&gt;, a French research team has uncovered two new culprits that contributed to the annihilation of the 500,000-strong army during the 1812 Russian campaign.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;killers? Two species of bacteria, responsible for causing fever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;It's&lt;/span&gt; a surprise finding by a French research paleogenomic group led by scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Typhus and &lt;/span&gt;trench fever were previously established as &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/infectious-diseases/t-71255642"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; that tore through the ranks of Napoleon's army during the 1812 retreat. The newly uncovered infections cause different diseases with similar symptoms.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"Even &lt;/span&gt;today, it would be nearly impossible to make a differential diagnosis between these [fever] symptoms with the different pathogens," said Nicolas Rascovan, a paleogenomicist from the Pasteur Institute, who led the study. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;It would be impossible for a doctor to tell you which pathogen is infecting you." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;First &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;retreat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;death&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Seeking&lt;/span&gt; to force Russian Tsar Alexander I to comply with his trade embargo against Britain, &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/napoleon-bonaparte/t-74485669"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt; led the largest army Europe had ever seen across Poland, Lithuania, and Belarus before marching on Russia.  &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;the summer of 1812, his forces successfully captured Moscow. From there, they fell into a stalemate with those of the Tsar, who refused to negotiate.  &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Laden &lt;/span&gt;with treasure, and Napoleon himself having already departed for Paris, the Grande Armee delayed its withdrawal until October 17.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; was then that a new threat advanced. Rather than Russian soldiers, the Grande Armee &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;had&lt;/span&gt; to contend with the triple threat of the advancing Russian winter, diminishing rations and disease. Barely 30,000 soldiers, around 6% of the original force, are recorded as having survived the withdrawal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;As &lt;/span&gt;well as starvation and the freezing weather, typhus — a common infection among army camps of the era — was thought to be one the deadliest hazards that haunted the Grande Armee&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Then&lt;/span&gt;, in 2002, excavators unearthed the bodies of hundreds of Napoleon's soldiers in Vilnius, the&lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/lithuania/t-66036518"&gt;Lithuanian&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;capital&lt;/span&gt;, one of the army's key stopping points. A 2006 analysis of some of these bodies found genetic evidence for &lt;em&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Rickettsia&lt;/span&gt; prowazeki&lt;/em&gt;i&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;the bacteria that causes the expected typhus, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Artonella&lt;/span&gt; quintana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;which causes trench fever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;But a &lt;/span&gt;new analysis of 13 different bodies from the Vilnius mass grave has uncovered new killers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="74485829" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/74485829_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="A man reviews an archeological site of skeletons in a mass grave"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;The mass grave at Vilnius was the burial site for hundreds of troops from Napoleon's Grand Army&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: Michel Signoli UMR 6578 - CNRS, Aix-Marseille Université, EFS&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Rascovan's&lt;/span&gt; team went searching for typhus and trench fever, but found two different diseases instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Using&lt;/span&gt; modern techniques for analyzing ancient DNA, the researchers found genetic remains of the paratyphoid-causing &lt;em&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Salmonella enterica &lt;/span&gt;enterica&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;bacteria&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Borrelia &lt;/span&gt;recurrentis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; cause of relapsing fever&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;four diseases identified in the remains of Napoleon's troops all carry similar symptoms associated with fevers, such as muscle aches and fatigue. To army medics in 1812, they would appear to be the same affliction. When combined with food shortages, freezing conditions and the fatigue of battle, these fevers would have made survival almost impossible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Rascovan&lt;/span&gt; expects more deadly diseases could still be discovered among the dead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;Ancient DNA has moved forward as a field [since 2006], has expanded enormously," Rascovan told DW. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;We can, today, 200 years after, do a diagnosis and find all the different pathogens that were potentially present." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Paleogenomic&lt;/span&gt; scientists analyze ancient remains for genetic markers. The findings can often be surprising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Earlier&lt;/span&gt; this year, Rascovan's team found that a&lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/secret-leprosy-infected-the-americas-before-european-arrival/a-72789502"&gt;type of leprosy was already circulating in the Americas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt; prior&lt;/span&gt; to the first European arrivals in 1492. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;discipline has also been used to chart the movement of the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/from-the-plague-to-covid-how-epidemics-shaped-history/a-59360351"&gt;bubonic plague&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt; out &lt;/span&gt;of Central Asia during the Bronze Age. And researchers have tracked the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/homo-sapiens-made-it-to-northern-europe-45000-years-ago/a-68142867"&gt;movement of human groups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt; around&lt;/span&gt; the world as well as how they &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/neanderthals-live-on-in-modern-man/a-5551290"&gt;interbred with each other&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;It's&lt;/span&gt; even been used to shed light on &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/beethoven-locks-of-hair-give-new-clues-on-composers-health/a-65085634"&gt;the illnesses that plagued German composer Ludwig van Beethoven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Historians&lt;/span&gt; are excited about the possibilities of using DNA analysis to improve understanding of major events in recent centuries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"Not &lt;/span&gt;only because it makes our historical knowledge a little bit more precise, but it also gives us an insight into different kinds of social conditions," said Erica Charters, a historian of war and disease based at Oxford University in the UK.  &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Charters, &lt;/span&gt;who was not involved in Rascovan's study, said the scale of Napoleon's conquests by 1812 would enable disease to move easily across Europe—not just because of the movement of his soldiers, but also due to trade among the French Empire and its neighboring alliances. One of the bacteria uncovered by Rascovan's team was even found to have English origins. Given Britain was Napoleon's primary enemy, and separated from France by an ocean, it shows how mobile diseases could be in times of major conflict. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"The &lt;/span&gt;retreat from Russia for the French Army is astounding," Charters told DW. "They're losing 95% of their forces from deaths and there's very few battles." &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="74485807" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/74485807_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Hands wearing white latex gloves handle an old tooth."&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;One of the teeth analyzed identified genetic remains of bacteria that cause paratyphoid and relapsing fever. &lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: Claudio Centonze/Commission européenne&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;Disease and war &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;come&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;together&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;From&lt;/span&gt; a historical perspective, these kinds of numbers are somewhat unusual, Charters said. But high rates of disease, and death from disease, are not at all unusual during wartime. &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;The breakdown &lt;/span&gt;of civil infrastructure and the loss of food supplies for communities and militaries increase outbreaks of disease, she added.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;We actually see a lot of epidemics rising when there's an outbreak of war," she said, "These tend to be phenomena that break out together." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;She&lt;/span&gt; points to an outbreak of syphilis in Europe amid conflicts in the 15th and 16th centuries, and the spread of influenza following World War I.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Understanding &lt;/span&gt;how diseases spread during war can also give an insight into the risks associated with modern conflicts: sanitation, not simply advances in medicine, is a critical factor.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;If you look around today and you look to see where epidemics may be happening, it's very often because there's been conflict which has broken down water supplies, Charters said, "which means that sanitation is gone and now means you have outbreaks." &lt;/p&gt;

Using comparative genomic analysis and a model they developed to infer the host origin of each isolate, they found that 18% of the UTIs were linked to ExPEC strains that came from the meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also discovered that UTIs in patients from high-poverty neighborhoods were 60% more likely to be caused by these zoonotic (animal-to-human) ExPEC strains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published yesterday in the journal &lt;em&gt;mBio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings underscore the contribution of zoonotic ExPEC to the UTI burden in Southern California and the need for targeted interventions to reduce risk in vulnerable communities," the study authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;An underappreciated cause of UTIs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings build on research that Lance Price, PhD, founding director of George Washington University's Antibiotic Resistance Action Center, and his colleagues have been conducting for more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/analysis-ties-resistant-e-coli-poultry-meat-human-utis"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2018, they found that a strain of &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt; that has caused serious UTIs around the world was prevalent in chicken and turkey meat. Then, in a follow-up &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771423000381"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 that used similar methods to the current study, they found that 8% of &lt;em&gt;E coli &lt;/em&gt;isolates from human UTIs in Flagstaff, Arizona, were linked to retail meat sold in local stores and likely originated from food-producing animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was surprising that it was more than twice as high," Price told CIDRAP News, referring to the new results. "And that led us to try to figure out why."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Foodborne &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is generally associated with gastrointestinal illness and certain diarrhea-causing strains, such as Shiga toxin–producing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; are tracked by industry and US health officials to make sure they are not contaminating the food supply and posing a risk to people. But the research Price and his colleagues have been conducting suggests that foodborne ExPEC strains that enter the urinary tract are an underappreciated cause of the 8 million UTIs diagnosed each year in the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The kind that kills the most people are the extraintestinal pathogenic E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; the kind that live in the gut with no symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although most UTIs are mild, they can progress to more serious invasive infections and sepsis if the infection gets into the bloodstream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"When most people hear &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; they think about diarrhea and these dramatic foodborne outbreaks," he said. "But the kind that kills the most people are the extraintestinal pathogenic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; the kind that live in the gut with no symptoms. If it gets in the urinary tract, it has these special features that allow it to cause disease."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;18% of &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt; came from food animals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To determine the percentage of UTIs in Southern California that could be attributed to zoonotic ExPEC strains, the research team—which also included scientists from the University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, Johns Hopkins University, and Statens Serum Institut—performed whole-genome sequencing on 2,349 human clinical &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; isolates collected from KPSC regional labs from February 2017 through May 2021. The patients were predominantly Hispanic (37.0%) and non-Hispanic White (31.7%) and resided in areas with low (42.2%) and medium family poverty rates (44.5%).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The investigators also sequenced 3,379 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; isolates collected from retail samples of chicken, turkey, beef, and pork that were bought weekly from major grocery chains in the region. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;contamination was highest in turkey samples (82%), followed by chicken (58%), pork (54%), and beef (47%), and was higher in meat samples from stores in high poverty areas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to comparing the core genomes of the human and foodborne &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; isolates, the researchers were looking for the presence of 17 human- and animal-associated mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Their statistical model combines this information to help determine the origin of the isolate. If animal-associated MGEs are prevalent in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; collected from UTI samples, that's an indication the source was an animal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we see &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt; in people that are carrying these chicken-adaptive mobile genetic elements, we can not only say that it came from chicken, but it probably came from chicken recently," Price explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The model estimated that 17.7% of the human clinical &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; isolates originated from food-producing animals, primarily chickens and turkeys. The researchers also found that a subset of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; lineages, primarily those from poultry products, appeared to have "enhanced capacity" to cause zoonotic UTIs. Urine samples from women were significantly more likely to have zoonotic ExPEC strains than samples from men (19.7% vs 8.5%). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Zoonotic strains less resistant to antibiotics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notably, the zoonotic ExPEC strains were less likely than the non-zoonotic strains to be resistant to the antibiotics commonly used to treat UTIs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This finding, the authors say, may support the effectiveness of efforts by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to limit use of medically important antibiotics in livestock. Although the FDA has been criticized for not doing more, the authors note that, in countries where there is little regulation of antibiotic use in livestock, studies have found significantly higher levels of resistance to medically important antibiotics in bacteria spread from animals to people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rigorous antibiotic stewardship is needed in human and animal medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gail Hansen, DVM, a public health and veterinary consultant who was not involved in the study, said the link between human UTIs and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; from chickens and other food-producing animals is another reminder of why antibiotic stewardship is important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Rigorous antibiotic stewardship is needed in human and animal medicine," Hansen said in an email. "We can't squander the precious resource of antibiotics anywhere."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Link between poverty rate, zoonotic &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what was even more surprising was that highest proportion of zoonotic ExPEC isolates (21.5%) was identified in patients from high-poverty areas. "After adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, individuals residing in a high-poverty area had a 1.6-fold increased risk of zoonotic ExPEC infections compared to those in low-poverty areas," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the factors underlying the correlate between the poverty rate and foodborne UTIs isn't entirely clear and needs further study, Price says he has some ideas. He notes that when he first began this line of research, he noticed that the chicken he bought from stores in poorer neighborhoods in Washington, DC, tended to be poorly packaged and "bloated with saline" that was likely contaminated with bacteria and could leak onto other groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they didn't compare retail meat packaging in stores from different neighborhoods in this study, Price says he would like to see if that could be a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do think that you could have the poorest-quality products in the poorest packaging being marketed in the poorest neighborhoods," he said. "It's a question worth investigating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, though, Price says recognizing meat as a potential source of exposure to zoonotic &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt; could help reduce the burden of UTIs. One place to start would be for industry or regulatory agencies to start testing meat for other types of &lt;em&gt;E coli,&lt;/em&gt; and not just the toxigenic strains that cause gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Almost every piece of chicken or ground turkey I test has &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt; in it," he said. "We should be doing more to decrease contamination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you open that package, just assume you've splattered some bacteria in your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until that happens, he added, consumers should follow safe food-handling procedures, including thorough cooking of meat, washing hands and surfaces, and avoiding cross-contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you open that package, just assume you've splattered some bacteria in your kitchen; assume every piece of meat is contaminated, and handle it that way," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Summer Bushman, from Salem, Virginia, lost her 10-year-old daughter Autumn to suicide earlier this year after months of bullying, both in person and online. In an interview with CBS News, she revealed that Autumn often used her phone in bed at night, a habit she now believes played a devastating role in her death. “She was looking at her phone just before it happened,” Summer said. “I wish I had never let her keep it in her room.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A vibrant child silenced by screens and bullying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autumn was, by all accounts, a bright and joyful child, a fourth-grade cheerleader who filled her home with music and dance. “She turned my living room into a stage,” her mother recalled. But behind her bubbly exterior, Autumn was struggling with relentless teasing about her braces and appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many children today, she sought connection through her phone, the same device that became a portal for cyberbullying. Late-night messages and social media comments compounded the hurt. What once might have ended at the school gates now followed her home, glowing quietly from her pillow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists call this the “24-hour schoolyard”, the digital extension of peer pressure and cruelty that leaves children little space to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A tragic night and a painful awakening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 21, Autumn took her own life in her bedroom. When her mother found her, the phone’s screen was still on. “She used to say she needed her alarm,” Summer said softly. “And every morning when I went to wake her, the alarm was ringing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tragedy reflects a troubling pattern seen across the world. In the United States alone, youth suicide rates have risen by over 50% in the past decade, with growing evidence linking social media use, especially at night, to depression and self-harm. A 2019 Lancet Psychiatry study found that adolescents spending more than three hours a day on social media were twice as likely to report mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The science behind sleep and screens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late-night phone use does more than expose children to online harm; it directly affects their mental and physical health. Screens emit blue light, which suppresses the hormone melatonin, disrupting natural sleep cycles. Sleep deprivation, in turn, intensifies anxiety, impulsivity, and depression, all factors linked to suicide risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent Virginia Tech study reinforced this connection. Researchers found that nearly 75% of adolescents who attempted suicide were using screens shortly before and that most incidents occurred after 8 p.m. “It’s pretty dangerous for bullied children to have their phones at night,” lead researcher Dr. Abhishek Reddy noted. “During the day, they have access to support, counsellors, teachers, parents. At night, that access disappears.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A mother’s call for digital boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Summer, her daughter’s loss has become a mission. She now advocates for parents to remove phones from bedrooms, restrict nighttime use, and encourage healthier sleep routines. “If I could go back, I’d take that phone away,” she said. “She deserved to live a long, happy life.

        &lt;p&gt;Here’s something to unnerve you during your next trip to the supermarket. Research out this week shows that a substantial portion of urinary tract infections can be traced back to store-bought meat tainted with dangerous &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at George Washington University and others examined thousands of samples taken from people with UTIs. They found that roughly one in five infections were likely caused by foodborne strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. The results suggest that contaminated meat is an underappreciated source of these often miserable infections, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These findings highlight zoonotic transmission as an important driver of UTIs,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01428-25"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the journal mBio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The origins of a UTI&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;UTIs are one of the most common infections around, and they’re &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/230/5/e1101/7701247"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to result in 3 million visits to the emergency room in the U.S. alone every year. Over 80% of UTIs are &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/report/urinary-tract-infection#:~:text=Bacteria%20that%20cause%20UTIs%20include,found%20in%20feces%20(stool)."&gt;caused&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. These bacteria are found most everywhere, including the guts of people and many of the animals that we regularly eat, though only some strains can make us sick.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The George Washington University researchers have been investigating the possibility of foodborne UTIs for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2018, for instance, they &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/store-bought-chicken-could-be-causing-urinary-tract-inf-1828652990"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a study showing clear evidence of human UTIs caused by &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; bacteria first found in store-bought meat, especially chicken. But the researchers say it’s still been unclear just how often UTIs are likely to originate from food, particularly in major metropolitan areas. To help answer this, they teamed up with other researchers at Kaiser Permanente Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Together, they collected a large amount of &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;samples from both real-life UTI patients in Southern California and packages of retail meat, ultimately sequencing the genetics of over 5,000 samples. They then developed an algorithm, based on 17 specific genetic markers, to identify whether a particular sample of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; originally came from animals or humans.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All told, they found that 18% of human UTI infections diagnosed in the region between 2017 and 2023 were probably zoonotic in origin—foodborne, in other words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hidden meat risk&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers note that their findings are limited to a single, if large, region. So more studies should be done to quantify the extent of this issue in other parts of the country. But given their earlier research, it certainly seems likely that tainted meat plays a significant and underrecognized role in UTIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Urinary tract infections have long been considered a personal health issue, but our findings suggest that they are also a food safety problem,” said senior study author Lance Price, a professor of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University, in a &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/nearly-1-5-urinary-tract-infections-linked-contaminated-meat"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The current findings might also help inform prevention efforts moving forward. The most dangerous foodborne UTI strains tended to come from chicken and turkey, for instance. And people living in low-income neighborhoods were more likely to have foodborne UTIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the same tips used to prevent foodborne illness in general should also lower your risk of these UTIs. That includes buying meat that’s securely sealed and won’t leak onto your other groceries, thoroughly cooking your meat, and washing your hands after handling raw food.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

I was prepared to answer awkward questions, provide condoms and buy Plan B like a good parent, because abstinence-only sex ed is how you end up with teen pregnancy and STDs. But I wasn’t prepared to need to cover burner phones, passports, and abortion bounty hunters! “It’s important to practice safe sex, but if you think you might be pregnant, don’t Google, pay cash for your pregnancy test, and certainly don’t tell your boyfriend because if you decide to go to Mexico to terminate, Border Patrol can search your phone and jail you and your boyfriend can turn you in for a $10,000 reward.” I’d like to think my girls are smart enough to conclude on their own that safe sex isn’t all that safe anymore, but hormones and developing brains don’t always make the best decisions. Do you have any tips for navigating this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

If you live in a place where abortion is illegal or severely restricted, then yes, make sure they know not to text about an unwanted pregnancy or to Google ways to terminate; you should also tell them to make sure they can fully trust their partner not to report them before sharing the news. Do your own research on where the nearest state is that provides abortions and how to go about securing care if the need arises. Make sure that your daughters know that sex always carries a risk, but that it is heightened where they live and encourage them to consider that when deciding what to do and where to go after high school. Make condoms available to them and tell them that if they wish to be sexually active, you’ll take them to get on birth control (if, hopefully, it remains available.) Acknowledge that talking to your mother about sex can be absolutely cringe-inducing, but that it would be better to endure some awkward chats than to find themselves in a difficult situation that could be avoided. Encourage them to wait until they are absolutely sure that they are ready to have sex and to only do so with a person who they can trust. Talk to them candidly about how boys often use girls for sex, or go tell others that they’ve been intimate with them. Tell them about the double standards for girls and boys and that while they shouldn’t determine what they choose to do, they may be penalized for simply honoring their desires. Make sure they are aware of what the major sexually transmitted infections are and how to obtain treatment. These are scary times indeed, but the more you share with your girls, the better prepared they will be.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Viruses are tiny — and sneaky.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So sneaky that some play a deadly game of hide and seek. The "seek" part is all too familiar: They're always looking for ways to infect humans. Their ability to hide is far less well-known and can have devastating implications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The human body holds several effective hiding spots that some of the world's nastiest viruses have discovered — like the eyes and the testes — that are beyond the reach of the immune system. It's here that submicroscopic viral RNA can safely linger.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Often the human hosts have no idea. They'd fallen ill, then appeared to beat the virus. Their blood tested negative. They show no symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But that hidden virus is capable of springing back into action. It can emerge from hiding — either sickening the original host or slipping into semen or breast milk and infecting someone new.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Which viruses have mastered this technique? A number of notorious ones from Zika to measles to highly deadly viruses like Nipah, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/10/06/g-s1-91435/virus-marburg-deadly-disease-rwanda" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Marburg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Lassa fever.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the virus that terrified the world in 2014: Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the decade since, the Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced more than its fair share of Ebola crises — with nine outbreaks, including one that is ongoing — and more than its fair share of hidden viruses that spring back into action.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Almost all the outbreaks recently — maybe not every single one of them but the vast majority — are traced back to a previous outbreak," says Dr. Elizabeth Higgs, who is with the Division of Clinical Research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. She says once the genetics of the virus are sequenced it is clear that many of the outbreaks haven't come from an animal — like a bat — but from a human who unwittingly carried the virus after surviving a previous outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While most survivors will never start a new outbreak, it is happening enough that Higgs says, "I think it's top of the research agenda."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Everybody was panicking"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Soka Moses first grasped the significance of these virus hideouts a decade ago. It was in mid-March 2015 when people in his West African country of Liberia were heaving a collective sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The country was emerging from a nightmare, recalls Moses, then the medical director at an Ebola treatment center. Nearly 5,000 people died over the previous year. Some perished in the streets, unable to find a hospital bed. Schools shuttered, markets closed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Finally, in early March of 2015, there were no more Ebola cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the crisis was not over.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Shortly after Liberia had reached zero cases, Moses recalls sitting in a daily meeting led by Liberia's National Epidemic Response Team when "boom! A case was identified." As word got out, he says: "Everybody was panicking: 'Oh, my God. Are we starting this again?'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of the panic was the mystery. How could this woman have contracted Ebola when there were no active cases? The virus spreads easily when someone comes into contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, even sweat or saliva, but it was not clear where or how this new patient could have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Family members eventually pointed medical investigators to the woman's sexual partner. Five months ago he'd recovered from Ebola. "[He'd] tested negative on two different occasions," says Moses. "[He was] doing perfectly fine, no symptoms whatsoever."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The man was terrified and, initially, avoided the authorities. "He thought he was in really big trouble," says Moses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once he was reassured that he was not in trouble, he agreed to cooperate. The challenge for scientists: Find out if the virus was hiding somewhere in his body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They ultimately determined that the Ebola virus was no longer in his blood … but lived on in his testes and had been transmitted in his semen.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"So that was the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18584" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first documented sexually transmitted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; case of Ebola virus disease," says Moses. While he'd read about a 1967 case in which another virus hid out in the body, the implications were now much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This prompted Moses to act. He's now the director of PREVAIL or the Partnership for Research on Vaccines &amp;amp; Infectious Diseases in Liberia, which studies the phenomenon of hidden viruses, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The body's sanctuary sites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers have identified a number of spots where the viruses can hide — not only eyes and testes but also the brain, the placenta and vaginal fluids as well as the mammary glands.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We call them sanctuary sites," says &lt;a href="https://www.usna.edu/NASEC/_files/documents/2023/CAPT_Joel_Montgomery.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joel Montgomery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the Viral Special Pathogens Branch at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the virus, these are havens protected from the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists think this is likely because these body parts are critical for survival — and vulnerable to damage if the immune system overreacts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, "in the process of making eggs and sperm, we mix and match the genes. So they're not really us anymore," says &lt;a href="https://medicine.tulane.edu/departments/pediatrics-medicine-infectious-diseases-debakey-pediatrics-med-peds-tips-mentor/faculty" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. John Schieffelin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at Tulane University School of Medicine. That means the immune system might see eggs or sperm as foreign invaders and try to attack them, so it's helpful if those parts of the body are outside the reach of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The brain has a special level of protection&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the blood brain barrier which limits the entry of immune cells. As for the eye? "An eye doctor might scold me for this, but to me, it's really an extension of the brain. There's a large nerve that goes from your eye directly into your brain," Schieffelin says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many mysteries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's still a lot scientists don't know about how viruses behave in these sanctuary sites.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For example, exactly how long can a virus stay there? In many cases where individuals were tested, it appears to be a matter of months. In some cases, it's years. There have even been semen samples that test negative for the virus at one point then return to positive later. It's not clear to scientists what prompted this reversal. And researchers haven't followed enough people who've harbored one of these infections long enough to know the outer limit.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another big unknown: What is the virus doing in the sanctuary site? It seems as if it's almost dormant, barely replicating. "But we don't know why someone relapses. We don't know if it's a drop in their immune system or if there's some other factor," says Montgomery.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear and stigma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Montgomery says the goal is to identify medications for survivors that can reach into sanctuary sites and root out any hidden virus. For this, he says, the size of the molecule in the drug is key.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We really need to explore the use of small-molecule drugs," he says, suggesting the smaller the drug's molecule the more likely it can penetrate the protective barrier around a sanctuary site.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Moses' team has been studying exactly this with the drug remdesivir — and results have been promising. Survivors who got the drug cleared the virus from their semen more quickly than survivors who got the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While many of the researchers are focused on the biology, something that's never far from their mind is the psychological part of the equation. Ebola survivors can face intense fear and stigma.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Dr. Dehkontee Dennis — who works at PREVAIL in Liberia — was enrolling for the study, she says she noticed "there was one thing that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these men have expressed: They have this fear. They don't want to transmit the virus to their families. They want to have children. They want to stop using condoms [to prevent transmission]."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The flip side of their fear is that many of the community members — who may have lost their partners and other family members to Ebola — fear the survivors may still pose a threat, even if they don't know about sanctuary sites. "Community members did not even want them back in the communities," says Moses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This level of stigma makes it tricky to talk about the risk that the virus could hide in a survivor and then resurface. Survivors and their community need to know there's a chance this could happen, the scientists say — but only in a small percentage of cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reassurance can also come from survivor programs that test semen and vaccination campaigns to protect the community. But scientists say the solution will be finding medications that can ferret out these hidden, potentially lethal viruses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's great that we have vaccines," says Joel Montgomery of the CDC. "It's great that we have therapeutics. It's great that we're saving people's lives. But now we need to figure out a way to make sure the virus is completely eliminated from them."&lt;/p&gt;

(CREDIT: Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breathing through your backside may sound like science fiction, but a Japanese clinical trial recently suggested that one day it might help human beings with lungs that can’t get enough oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study tested whether a specialized liquid called perfluorodecalin could be safely stored in the rectum for an hour. No one was injured, and that alone is telling news. It is the first time that this “enteral ventilation” approach, based on a fish that breathes from its intestines, has been attempted on humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A strange behavior of serious beginnings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story starts with a kind of eel fish called a loach. When kept in filth, low-oxygen water, it does something strange—it swallows air and absorbs oxygen in the intestines. The strange trick caught the attention of Japanese researcher Takanori Takebe, MD, PhD, a biomedical scientist with appointments in Tokyo and at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when ventilators had been used up in hospitals worldwide, Takebe was left wondering whether humans ever learned from the loach’s example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Graphical abstract of the study. (CREDIT: ScienceDirect Med)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion might seem laughable, but it is science-driven. The active ingredient is odorless, colorless liquid perfluorodecalin—a perfluorocarbon that had previously been under investigation for “liquid breathing.” The liquid can hold several times more oxygen than water and has already been used safely in surgery and eye treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple but revolutionary: if the fluid is filled with oxygen and the gut can absorb gases, why not use the gut as an auxiliary respiratory organ in the event of lung failure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The first human test&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new trial translated that question from the lab to the clinic. The phase 1 study took place at a Japanese hospital, where it recruited young men who volunteered to inject small amounts of non-oxygenated perfluorodecalin into their rectum for an hour. Scientists were not testing whether it would save lives—but whether it was safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process was serious, not jesting. Fluid was added gradually through a soft catheter, and volunteers were monitored closely for signs of pain, shifts in vital signs, or chemical indication of the fluid in their systems. The purpose was simple: determine the amount of fluid man could hold safely and whether their bodies reacted negatively to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Takanori Takebe, MD, PhD, a biomedical scientist with appointments in Tokyo and at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. (CREDIT: Dr. Takanori Takebe)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were surprisingly peaceful. Every one except a few tolerated the process well. Some reported bloating or cramping with higher volumes, but pain disappeared once the fluid was released. No one had negative, severe side effects, and blood tests showed no liver, kidney, or blood chemistry damage. Most significantly, the fluid didn’t intrude into the circulatory system—it stayed right where it was supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early whispers of promise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without added oxygen, perfluorodecalin contains more dissolved oxygen than venous blood. In theory, a small amount could diffuse through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did note weak signs that this was happening, but not enough to have a clinical effect yet. That’s not surprising—this was a safety study, not a rescue experiment. But it sets up the second trial, which will use fully oxygenated liquid to see if it can measurably boost oxygen in people with low blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Takebe, who himself won an Ig Nobel Prize once—a tongue-in-cheek prize for science that “first makes people laugh, then think”—this is no joke. “Enteric ventilation might be a life-saver as a back-up mode of oxygen delivery,” he said. “Our initial results suggest that it could save patients with severe respiratory failure when conventional ventilation fails.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;SpO2 profiles for the low-, medium-, or high-dosage group Changes in time series of the SpO2 values depending on the non-oxygenated perfluorodecalin dose for each group average. (CREDIT: ScienceDirect Med)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Behind the Humor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future tests confirm that oxygenated perfluorodecalin can boost blood oxygen, the procedure might revolutionize the treatment of respiratory distress for doctors. In an emergency, it might save precious minutes as doctors intubate a patient or prepare a ventilator. With fragile newborn lungs, it might be a more compassionate way to deliver oxygen without causing additional harm. And in global tragedies—when hospitals drain machines—there to serve as a low-tech salvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at EVA Therapeutics, founded by Takebe, are already planning the next round of trials in Japan. They will maximize how much liquid can be used, how long it should stay there, and how much oxygen might make its way into the blood. The hope is one day this strange-sounding solution might make a difference in quiet ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the humor is a vigorous warning: medical breakthroughs tend to begin with concepts that sound preposterous. After being dismissed as a curiosity, the breathing of the loach in its intestines now serves as the foundation for a potential new technique for maintaining human life. With ventilators in short supply and respiratory arrest still being fatal, even the most absurd concepts deserve a second review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Tolerability and adverse events from testing related to the study. (CREDIT: ScienceDirect Med)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Practical Implications of the Research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the trials prove out that oxygenated perfluorodecalin is safe to deliver oxygen through the intestine, hospitals may have a new tool in the respiratory crisis arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method could lower the risk of ventilator-induced damage, support delicate newborn lungs, and give life-saving aid when other machinery is unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also challenges scientists to re-conceive human physiology and teaches us that sometimes survival is more about imagination than medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research findings are available online in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666634025003149" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ScienceDirect Med;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ScienceDirect Med&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like these kind of feel good stories?

The research, involving data from more than one million participants, found that people with genetic traits that naturally reduce cholesterol are less likely to develop dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Dr. Liv Tybjærg Nordestgaard during her time at the University of Bristol and at the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at Copenhagen University Hospital -- Herlev and Gentofte. The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Clues and Cholesterol-Lowering Effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some individuals are born with genetic variants that affect the same proteins targeted by cholesterol-lowering medications such as statins and ezetimibe. To explore whether these drugs might influence dementia risk, the team used a technique called Mendelian Randomization. This method allows scientists to study how specific genetic variants mimic the effects of a treatment while minimizing the influence of outside factors like weight, diet, or lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing people with and without these cholesterol-lowering genetic variants, the researchers observed a clear difference in dementia risk. A small decrease in cholesterol levels (about one millimole per liter) was associated with up to an 80% reduction in dementia risk for certain drug-related genetic targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower Cholesterol, Lower Dementia Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What our study indicates is that if you have these variants that lower your cholesterol, it looks like you have a significantly lower risk of developing dementia," said Dr. Nordestgaard, who now works in the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at Copenhagen University Hospital -- Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that keeping cholesterol levels low -- whether through genetics or medical treatment -- may protect against dementia. However, the research does not yet confirm that cholesterol-lowering drugs themselves directly prevent the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Studying Dementia Is So Challenging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because dementia often develops late in life, studying its causes requires tracking participants for decades. This makes it difficult to establish cause and effect in traditional clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also remains unclear why high cholesterol raises dementia risk. One explanation, according to Dr. Nordestgaard, is that high cholesterol contributes to atherosclerosis -- the buildup of fatty deposits in blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Cholesterol May Harm the Brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Atherosclerosis is a result of the accumulation of cholesterol in your blood vessels," Dr. Nordestgaard said. "It can be in both the body and the brain and increases the risk of forming small blood clots -- one of the causes of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It would be a really good next step to carry out randomised clinical trials over 10 or 30 years, for example, where you give the participants cholesterol-lowering medication and then look at the risk of developing dementia," Dr. Nordestgaard added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Collaboration and Funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study used data from the UK Biobank, the Copenhagen General Population Study, the Copenhagen City Heart Study, the FinnGen study, and the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding was provided by the Medical Research Council, Independent Research Fund Denmark, and Research Council at the Capital Region of Denmark (LTN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;You probably think of testosterone as the male sex hormone. Indeed, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/testosterone-information" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;FDA currently &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; approves supplemental testosterone&lt;/a&gt; treatment — available as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;injections, topical creams and gels, patches, pills, and more — for cisgender men who have low levels of the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;But the reality is that testosterone is also a crucial hormone for women, whose ovaries produce it right alongside estrogen and progesterone. All three hormones decline as women age, meaning that in spite of the FDA’s lack of approval, they’re finding ways to take it — and raving about the results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Like with men, testosterone boosts sex drive and aggression in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;women, and limited studies show &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21008-7" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;it may support bone health&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00737-024-01513-6" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;contribute to mood and energy.&lt;/a&gt; Testosterone production tends to peak in women’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;late teens and early 20s, and slowly declines thereafter; after menopause, its&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;levels are halved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Add it all up, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/magazine/testosterone-women-health-sex-libido-menopause.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports in a new feature&lt;/a&gt;, and many are framing testosterone supplements as something akin to an off-label fountain of youth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“It’s changed my marriage,” a 41-year-old marketing consultant told the paper, adding that she’d gone&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;from uninterested in sleeping with her husband to having sex upwards of six days a week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;It’s not just a libido thing, either: many women&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;experience an uptick of ambitious energy on testosterone therapy. One &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;source even reported that her daughter said she’d become&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;argumentative “like a teenage boy.” (No surprise there; adolescent boys produce &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323085#treatment" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;over 10 times the amount as their female peers&lt;/a&gt;.) Other purported benefits include&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;decreased fatty tissue, increased muscle mass and cognitive performance, and even better skin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Not everybody is convinced. Doctors warn that &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/low-dose-testosterone-for-females#side-effects" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;some women report unpleasant side effect&lt;/a&gt;s ranging from increased facial and body hair growth to changes in body odor, and the risks of long-term use are under-studied. And like all health crazes, the narrative has been filtered and distorted by social media and influencer culture. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Advertising that testosterone is going to fix all that stuff is very premature and overblown,” Elektra Health chief medical officer Nora Lansen recently &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/health/article/women-testosterone-therapy-benefits-risks?loggedin=true&amp;amp;rnd=1761224767704" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though she didn’t advise against women experimenting with the treatment if they thought it might help. “It’s inappropriate for now because we don’t know whether, like, you know, what the real story is.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The treatment also remains dangerously marginalized. Because women’s health has long been underserved by the medical system, options for women to pursue testosterone therapy are typically limited to more nontraditional avenues like wellness centers, nutritionists, med-spas and longevity practitioners. Unlike testosterone clinics for men, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/well/testosterone-therapy-menopause.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;none of those are covered by insurance&lt;/a&gt; for women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;And even with that limited availability, critics might note the irony of the &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;rapturizing over the benefits of hormone therapy for cisgender patients after it’s &lt;a href="https://glaad.org/nyt-podcast-trans-healthcare/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;spent years fearmongering&lt;/a&gt; about similar treatment for transgender people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Still, it’s a powerful substance, and everybody should have options to pursue treatments that might be helpful to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Testosterone is like a religion,” one urologist told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. “People have strong feelings when it comes to testosterone.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on testosterone:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/smearing-testosterone-on-men-makes-them-into-horny-beasts-scientists-find"&gt;Smearing Testosterone on Men Makes Them Into Horny Beasts, Scientists Find&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                Two-to-three thousand soldiers from Napoleon's army were found in a mass grave in the northern suburbs of Vilnius, Lithuania in 2001.

   &lt;p&gt;By 1812, Napoleon was all powerful. Nearly all of Europe was under his control. He had succeeded in forbidding most of the continent from trading with Britain in an effort to bring the island nation to heel. And he was married to Marie Louise, daughter of the emperor of Austria, a major superpower at the time. (The dazzling emerald and diamond necklace that he gifted her when they were wed was one of the objects stolen in last weekend's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/19/nx-s1-5579509/thieves-steal-priceless-jewels-louvre" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;heist at the Louvre&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the Russian Empire had been resisting his efforts to cut off all trade with Britain. That summer, he ordered his army, some 600,000 strong, to invade Russia. It would prove to be a terrible decision.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This is one of the most infamous military campaigns in the last centuries," says &lt;a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/microbial-paleogenomics/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nicolás Rascovan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the microbial paleogenomics unit at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. "He believed that he was going to be able to conquer the whole world, more or less. It was probably the beginning of the end."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In October, Napoleon called his soldiers back after barely engaging the Russian army. It wasn't a defeat, but it was no win either. And during the march home, winter arrived early.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They started to die of cold, hunger, and also infectious diseases," says Rascovan. All told, hundreds of thousands perished.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And in a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)01247-3" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Current Biology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Rascovan and his colleagues say those diseases likely include two unexpected pathogens that would have helped hasten the soldiers' demise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-94828" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Napoleon's retreating soldiers suffered from the bitter cold, hunger, and an onslaught of disease.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Combined with earlier work, it's become clear that these men were under microbial assault on all fronts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These wars were anything but glamorous," says &lt;a href="https://www.novetus.at/#kontakt" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Michaela Binder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bioarchaeologist with Novetus, an archaeology company based in Vienna, who wasn't involved in the study. "For some of them, the death in battle would have been a relief."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A rich and bloody history, reconstructed&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Typhus and trench fever have long been thought to be among the afflictions that Napoleon's soldiers suffered. This is based on a mix of historical accounts, the discovery of body lice on the remains of soldiers (which carried the pathogens that transmitted the ailments), and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/193/1/112/863741" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA analyses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; conducted nearly a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But molecular techniques have improved dramatically since then.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And so a pair of archaeologists asked Rascovan, who studies the DNA of ancient pathogens, to see what other afflictions he might be able to turn up in the remains of a mass grave in Lithuania. The site had been discovered accidentally during a construction project in one the northern suburbs of Vilnius in 2001. Two-to-three thousand of Napoleon's men had been buried there soon after they died.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Europe has such a rich history that we have archaeological sites pretty much everywhere," says Rascovan. "So you dig a hole in the ground and then you find something."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-94829" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Among the remains that the archaeologists had unearthed were 13 teeth, each from a different soldier. These teeth would have had blood flowing through their interiors long ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you have DNA of the pathogen in the blood because you have an infection, that DNA can get into the tooth," explains Rascovan. "So then it's kind of a time machine in which you can really see the blood of the individual back then."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Only after decontaminating the teeth, grinding them into a powder, and dissolving the bone dust could the ancient DNA be studied. But naturally, that genetic code was in rough shape. It consisted of super short fragments that had undergone chemical changes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rascovan sequenced all of it. Some of the genetic material came from the soldiers themselves. Some of it derived from organisms in the soil in which they were buried. And some of it — perhaps — was from pathogens that helped kill these men.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Once we have a huge list of all the different things that have been detected, we try to find which are the species that match a human pathogen," he says. "It's like doing a puzzle."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'A story of hardship'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After Rascovan and his team finished that puzzle, they had two hits. Both of them were bacteria: one that caused paratyphoid fever and the other relapsing fever, a pathogen transmitted by body lice that dated back to the Iron Age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This paper shows clearly how complex these types of analyses are and the extreme level of skill required to work with these types of data," says &lt;a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/oeai/institute/team/person/leslie-quade" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Leslie Quade&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a paleopathologist at the Austrian Archaeological Institute who didn't participate in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She says that discerning the emergence, spread, and evolution of diseases in the past can also help us navigate the pathogens of today.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Understanding how certain types of pathogens developed can give us a better chance of anticipating what a pathogen's next step might be," says Quade. In addition, if a certain once-widespread pathogen has become rare today, these infection-laden historical events may offer lessons to learn to keep it from returning and to contain other similar modern pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These findings are another reminder that war has always been ugly, Binder says. "We have these paintings in the museums of soldiers in shiny armors, of Napoleon on his horse, fit young men marching into battle."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But in the end, when we look at the human remains, we see an entirely different picture," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's a picture of lifelong malnutrition, broken feet from marching too far, too quickly, and bodies riddled with disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Their bones tell a story of hardship," says Binder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These microscopic clusters, known as alpha-synuclein oligomers, have long been suspected as the starting point for Parkinson's, but they have remained undetectable in human brain tissue -- until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team from the University of Cambridge, UCL, the Francis Crick Institute, and Polytechnique Montréal developed a powerful imaging approach that allows scientists to visualize, count, and compare these protein clumps in human brain tissue. One researcher described the breakthrough as "like being able to see stars in broad daylight."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, the findings could transform how scientists study Parkinson's, offering new insights into how it spreads through the brain and paving the way for earlier diagnosis and more targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parkinson's: A Growing Global Health Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 166,000 people in the UK currently live with Parkinson's disease, and the global total is expected to reach 25 million by 2050. While existing drugs can ease symptoms such as tremors and stiffness, none can halt or slow the disease's progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over a century, doctors have identified Parkinson's by the presence of large protein deposits known as Lewy bodies. Yet researchers have long believed that smaller, early-stage oligomers may actually cause the damage to brain cells. Until now, these microscopic structures, just a few nanometers long, were impossible to observe directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeing Parkinson's at Its Earliest Stages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Lewy bodies are the hallmark of Parkinson's, but they essentially tell you where the disease has been, not where it is right now," said Professor Steven Lee from Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, who co-led the research. "If we can observe Parkinson's at its earliest stages, that would tell us a whole lot more about how the disease develops in the brain and how we might be able to treat it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the researchers created a method called ASA-PD (Advanced Sensing of Aggregates for Parkinson's Disease). This ultra-sensitive fluorescence microscopy technique can detect and analyze millions of oligomers in post-mortem brain samples. Because the oligomers are so tiny, their signal is faint, but ASA-PD enhances that signal while reducing background noise, allowing scientists to clearly see individual alpha-synuclein clusters for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illuminating the Invisible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time we've been able to look at oligomers directly in human brain tissue at this scale: it's like being able to see stars in broad daylight," said co-first author Dr Rebecca Andrews, who conducted the work when she was a postdoctoral researcher in Lee's lab. "It opens new doors in Parkinson's research."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined brain tissue from people with Parkinson's and compared it to samples from healthy individuals of similar age. They found that oligomers were present in both groups, but in those with Parkinson's, the clusters were larger, brighter, and far more numerous. This difference suggests a strong connection between oligomer growth and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clues to the Earliest Signs of Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also identified a unique subset of oligomers found only in Parkinson's patients, which may represent the earliest detectable signs of the disease -- possibly appearing years before symptoms emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This method doesn't just give us a snapshot," said Professor Lucien Weiss from Polytechnique Montréal, wo co-led the research. "It offers a whole atlas of protein changes across the brain and similar technologies could be applied to other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Huntington's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oligomers have been the needle in the haystack, but now that we know where those needles are, it could help us target specific cell types in certain regions of the brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Window Into the Human Brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The only real way to understand what is happening in human disease is to study the human brain directly, but because of the brain's sheer complexity, this is very challenging," said Professor Sonia Gandhi from The Francis Crick Institute, who co-led the research. "We hope that breaking through this technological barrier will allow us to understand why, where and how protein clusters form and how this changes the brain environment and leads to disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was made possible with support from Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (ASAP), the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and the Medical Research Council (MRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). The team expressed gratitude to the patients, families, and caregivers who donated brain tissue to research, enabling discoveries like this to advance understanding and potential treatment of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p class="sa-bnr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-204056"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1-2 cups a day seem to hit the sweet spot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysing data from more than 46000 adults across two decades of the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40368300/"&gt;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,&lt;/a&gt; researchers found that drinking 1-2 cups of caffeinated coffee per day was linked to a 14-16% lower risk of death from all causes compared to no coffee at all. The protective effect extended to cardiovascular mortality, but not to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the benefit plateaued at around 3 cups. Drinking more didn’t seem to lower the risk any further, and for heart disease, the positive association even weakened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The health benefits of coffee might be attributable to its bioactive compounds. But our results suggest that the addition of sugar and saturated fat may reduce the mortality benefits,” said Fang Fang Zhang, senior author and nutrition professor at Tufts University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When your coffee stops helping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key distinction in the study was between black coffee or coffee with low levels of sugar and saturated fat versus the sweet, milky versions many people enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee drinkers who kept their additions under 0,5 teaspoon of sugar and about a 1 tablespoon of light cream per cup retained the longevity benefit. Those who routinely added more lost it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Few studies have examined how coffee additives could impact the link between coffee consumption and mortality. Our results align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which recommend limiting added sugar and saturated fat,” said first author Bingjie Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings reflect a simple but powerful idea: the health halo of coffee disappears when it turns into dessert. For many people, daily lattes and flavoured coffees can add 100-200 calories which counteract the polyphenols and antioxidants thought to drive coffee’s benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeinated wins, decaf less clear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that caffeinated coffee showed the strongest link with lower mortality. Decaf did not demonstrate a clear association likely due to low consumption among participants, but also possibly because caffeine itself contributes some of coffee’s biological effects, such as improved vascular function and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes coffee protective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee is rich in chlorogenic acid, polyphenols, and other antioxidants that may reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and protect cells from oxidative stress. These effects could explain its link to lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and overall mortality in numerous studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Tufts researchers emphasise that observational studies can only show associations, not cause and effect. People who drink moderate coffee might also have other healthy habits that play a role. Still, after adjusting for factors such as age, diet, smoking, and physical activity, the association held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what’s the takeaway for your daily cup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re already a coffee drinker, there’s no reason to stop, but you might want to rethink what goes in your mug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick to 1–3 cups a day. This range seems to maximise benefits without adding potential downsides from higher &lt;a href="https://www.welovecycling.com/wide/2018/04/13/is-chocolate-a-good-source-of-caffeine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;caffeine intake.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep sugar under 2,5 g per cup. That’s about half a teaspoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limit to 1 tablespoon of light cream or half-and-half, or about 5 tablespoons of 2% milk per cup to stay below 1 g of saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderate, mostly black coffee appears to support longevity, but turning it into a milkshake cancels those gains. In other words, your morning brew may indeed help you live longer, as long as it’s coffee, not dessert.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as we drift into what feels like unconscious rest, our brains might not be entirely asleep. According to the study &lt;em&gt;DREAM: The Dream EEG and Mentation Database&lt;/em&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, parts of the brain can remain alert during even the deepest stages of sleep — and dreaming may not be limited to REM sleep after all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This large-scale, international collaboration brings together decades of dream research into one unified, open-access platform. Coordinated by &lt;em&gt;Monash University&lt;/em&gt; in Australia, the DREAM project analyzed 2,643 awakenings from 505 volunteers, drawing data from 20 separate studies across 13 countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dreams Beyond REM: Sleep Is Less Silent Than It Seems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, REM sleep was viewed as the exclusive domain of dreaming — marked by vivid imagery, muscle paralysis, and rapid eye movements. But the data in DREAM challenge this assumption. Among the 2,643 awakenings, participants reported having dream experiences in about 85% of REM cases, but also in a surprising 40% to 60% of NREM (non-REM) awakenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even during slow-wave sleep — the deepest and most restorative phase — some individuals described emotional thoughts or fragmented sensations. The researchers examined the final 30 seconds of brain activity before each awakening, using &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61945-1" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61945-1" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EEG and MEG technologies&lt;/a&gt; to capture electrical and magnetic patterns in the brain. What they found was surprising: in NREM dreams, brain waves began to show faster, smaller oscillations, mimicking the patterns of quiet wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, the brain — or at least &lt;em&gt;part of it&lt;/em&gt; — may temporarily enter an “awake-like” state, despite the body remaining deeply asleep. These episodes may reflect &lt;strong&gt;brief bursts of conscious processing&lt;/strong&gt;, supporting the idea that consciousness during sleep is more of a spectrum than a switch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Artificial Intelligence Learns to Read Dreams&lt;/h2&gt;

Each awakening in the study was classified into one of three categories:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; (a clear dream),&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;an &lt;em&gt;experience without recall&lt;/em&gt; (often called a &lt;strong&gt;white dream&lt;/strong&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;or &lt;em&gt;no experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This triage system allowed researchers to train artificial intelligence models to predict whether a person had been dreaming based on brain activity alone. Simpler brain-wave features gave moderate accuracy in detecting dreams during deep NREM sleep, while more complex models improved accuracy during REM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/is-our-brain-ever-fully-asleep-it-may-stay-awake-even-as-we-dream-48184" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.discovermagazine.com/is-our-brain-ever-fully-asleep-it-may-stay-awake-even-as-we-dream-48184" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, this is one of the first large-scale efforts to develop non-invasive dream detection tools. With further refinement, such technology could be used to monitor consciousness during sleep — or even serve as an early marker for cognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, other research referenced in the article suggests that difficulty reaching REM sleep may signal an early warning sign for Alzheimer’s disease, hinting at a broader medical relevance for sleep-stage mapping and dream monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As co-author &lt;em&gt;Giulio Bernardi&lt;/em&gt; noted in a press release, &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The work presented in the article, coordinated by Monash University (Australia), resulted from the efforts of 53 authors from 37 institutions across 13 countries, and represents a decisive step in the scientific exploration of human consciousness by bringing together and making decades of dream research available in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Okay, they don’t actually rhyme, but Golden Retrievers are definitely goofy, LOL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Just take the two very determined &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/mischievous-golden-retriever-loves-rage-161500540.html" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; brothers in this video. In this footage, these precious canine brothers have encountered a trampoline in their backyard and are determined to figure out what this thing is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Between the two of them, we are convinced that they share one golden brain cell, because neither of them is exactly the canine Sherlock Holmes, LOL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The lighter of these two canine brothers seemed to think that the best way to get to the bottom of this mysterious trampoline thing was to bounce up and down on it, which was the right idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although this &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-overjoyed-reaction-reuniting-211500195.html" data-ylk="slk:determined dog;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;determined dog&lt;/a&gt; didn’t seem to understand that bouncing was the point, they wanted to get to something that was apparently underneath the trampoline by bouncing up and down on it.

However, he didn’t really like this very much and barked at his brother to leave the bouncing to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/mischievous-golden-retriever-loves-rage-161500540.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Mischievous Golden Retriever Who Loves To ‘Rage Bait’ Feline Sibling Has Us Cracking Up;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Mischievous Golden Retriever Who Loves To ‘Rage Bait’ Feline Sibling Has Us Cracking Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;His brother listened to him for a moment before he decided to get back on the trampoline and bounce away in unison with his brother. Once again, his brother told him off. Apparently, getting to the bottom of what this trampoline is all about is a one-dog job, LOL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After this extravaganza had gone on for quite some time, the other Golden Retriever brother decided to try reaching under the trampoline, at which point they succeeded in retrieving a small orange ball that had gotten stuck underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And so ended the great Golden Retriever trampoline mystery of October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;These Dogs Share a Single Brain Cell&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As this other video shows, there can be no doubt that these adorable Golden Retriever brothers share a single brain cell. Is the lighter one trying to stand on top of his brother just because…? Or is the darker one trying to wear his brother as a hat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We think there is a good joke to be had somewhere in all this. How many smiling Golden Retrievers does it take to screw in a lightbulb? How many licks does it take for a Golden Retriever to get to the center of the Tootsie Pop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;How many times will these affable, yet hapless, dogs lose a ball under the trampoline and then try pushing their way through it, bouncing up and down without success, before they remember that all they have to do is reach under the trampoline to retrieve their ball, just like they did last time?

It might feel harmless, but missing out on proper rest has a quiet way of affecting almost every part of your body. Sleep is not just downtime; it’s when your body repairs, restores and resets itself. When you sleep less than you should, your heart, brain, and metabolism start to pay the price. Over time, poor sleep can build up into serious health problems. Here’s a clear look at how a lack of sleep harms your physical and mental well-being, and why getting those seven to nine hours truly matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What really happens to your body when you don’t get enough sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sleep deprivation increases your risk of heart disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most worrying effects of sleep loss is how it strains your heart. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12116485/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that short sleep duration is strongly linked to higher risks of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, stroke and coronary heart disease. According to this study, both sleeping too little and too much can increase the risk of early death, but short sleep, less than seven hours a night, is the bigger threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fix Your Sleep Naturally! Sadhguru’s 5-Step Routine for Deep Rest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you don’t sleep enough, your body stays in a mild state of stress. Your blood pressure remains high, your heart rate increases, and the body releases more stress hormones like cortisol. These reactions might not seem like much in the short term, but over weeks and months, they wear down your cardiovascular system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who regularly sleep under six hours are about 1.6 times more likely to develop hypertension than those who get adequate rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This problem becomes worse with age. Older adults who already have health conditions are more vulnerable, but studies also show that younger adults who sleep less are at a 25% higher risk of developing long-term heart problems. Simply put, your heart needs rest as much as your mind does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Poor sleep habits can slow your metabolism and cause obesity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep doesn’t just make you tired; it affects how your body manages food and energy. Short sleep duration changes how your hormones work. It lowers leptin (which helps you feel full) and raises ghrelin (which makes you hungry). As a result, you crave more food, especially sugary or high-carb snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several reviews have confirmed a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and obesity risk. This means that sleeping less than six hours or more than nine hours increases your chances of gaining weight. People with sleep deprivation are around 1.5 times more likely to become obese than those who sleep normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your blood sugar also takes a hit. Lack of sleep reduces insulin sensitivity, meaning your body struggles to regulate glucose levels. Over time, this can lead to type 2 diabetes. Some studies even show that men who consistently sleep less than six hours face a higher diabetes risk than women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is simple; your metabolism depends on rest. Even with a good diet and exercise, chronic sleep loss can undo your progress by altering how your body stores fat and uses energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Lack of sleep triggers anxiety, stress, and emotional burnout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever been irritable after a poor night’s sleep, you’ve seen how closely sleep and emotions are tied. But the effects go deeper than just being grumpy or tired. According to various reviews, chronic sleep deprivation increases anxiety, emotional instability, and depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you don’t get enough rest, your brain’s ability to regulate emotions weakens. The amygdala, responsible for processing emotions, becomes overactive, while areas that control judgment and calm responses slow down. This imbalance makes it easier to feel overwhelmed, anxious, or angry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies found that people who consistently sleep less report higher levels of stress hormones and lower emotional resilience. Over time, poor sleep can also impact relationships and social life. It reduces patience, empathy and focus, all vital for maintaining healthy connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health experts now consider sleep loss not just a symptom of stress or depression, but also a contributing cause. Getting adequate rest improves your ability to handle stress and regulate emotions, making it a key part of emotional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building better sleep habits: How to fix your routine for long-term health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that sleep habits can be improved with simple lifestyle changes. You don’t need special supplements or devices; just consistency and awareness. Health researchers recommend adults sleep for seven to nine hours per night, and older adults for at least seven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here are a few practical ways to restore healthy sleep patterns:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stick to a schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid screens before bed. Blue light from phones and laptops delays melatonin release, making it harder to fall asleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit caffeine and heavy meals at night. Both can disrupt your body’s natural rest rhythm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your room cool and quiet. A comfortable environment improves sleep quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wind down. Try reading, meditation, or light stretching before bed to signal your body it’s time to rest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts also suggest that workplaces and schools need to recognise sleep as part of overall well-being. Adjusting schedules, promoting flexible work hours, and discouraging late-night work can go a long way in improving community health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of sleep doesn’t just make you tired; it affects nearly every system in your body. From raising blood pressure and blood sugar levels to influencing mood and weight, the effects are wide and serious. The evidence clearly shows that consistent, quality sleep is essential for good health. It supports your heart, metabolism and mental stability. If you’re sleeping less than seven hours most nights, it’s worth taking a step back and rethinking your routine.

The infection often remains asymptomatic, allowing the bacteria to persist for years, but it can lead to ulcers and, in severe cases, gastric cancer. High-risk populations include people in East Asia, Eastern Europe, South America, older adults, and those with certain dietary habits or family history. Early detection, lifestyle modifications, and targeted treatment can prevent infection-related cancer and reduce the global burden of stomach cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;H. pylori bacteria and their role in &lt;keyword id="20349122" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="stomach-cancer-risk" source="Orion"&gt;stomach cancer risk&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common bacterium, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), has been linked to a significant proportion of stomach cancer cases worldwide. According to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03793-6" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a study published in Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, nearly 76% of gastric cancers may be attributable to this bacterium. Researchers estimate that approximately 16 million people born between 2008 and 2017 could develop stomach cancer in their lifetime, with around 12 million of these cases directly linked to H. pylori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. pylori lives in the stomach lining and can silently persist for years without producing noticeable symptoms. While most people remain unaware of its presence, the bacterium can sometimes lead to peptic ulcers and, in severe cases, gastric cancer. Asia is projected to account for the majority of H. pylori-related cases, with nearly 8 million expected, while North and South America may see about 1.5 million cases combined. Understanding the role of H. pylori in stomach cancer is vital because it identifies a largely preventable risk factor. Unlike cancers caused by genetics or lifestyle alone, early detection and treatment of H. pylori infection can dramatically reduce future gastric cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is most at risk of H. pylori infection and gastric cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain populations are more vulnerable to H. pylori-related stomach cancer. People living in high-prevalence regions, particularly East Asia, Eastern Europe, and parts of South America, face a higher lifetime risk. First-generation immigrants from these regions may also carry the bacteria if they were infected during childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other risk factors include a family history of stomach cancer, older age, smoking, obesity, and diets high in salted, smoked, or processed foods. Adults over 60 are especially susceptible, and some genetic predispositions can further increase vulnerability. High-risk individuals should remain vigilant and consider screening for H. pylori if symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Signs and &lt;keyword id="29822654" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="symptoms-of-H-pylori" source="Orion"&gt;symptoms of H. pylori&lt;/keyword&gt; infection to watch for&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. pylori often develops in childhood and remains dormant for years. Although many carriers never experience symptoms, about 30% develop complications such as ulcers or gastritis. Common warning signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Burning stomach pain or discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling full quickly after meals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea or frequent burping&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Indigestion and bloating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the bacteria can go undetected for years, persistent digestive discomfort should never be ignored. Timely medical evaluation can prevent serious complications and lower the risk of gastric cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention and lifestyle changes to lower stomach cancer risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although H. pylori is a major risk factor, lifestyle and preventive measures can significantly reduce the likelihood of developing stomach cancer. Key steps include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular physical activity to support overall health&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding or quitting smoking, which compounds gastric cancer risk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limiting alcohol consumption&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeking a timely medical evaluation for persistent digestive symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community awareness is also crucial. Educating families about the bacteria, safe hygiene practices, and risk factors can reduce transmission and promote early detection, particularly in high-prevalence regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Screening, diagnosis, and treatment options for H. pylori&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening for H. pylori infection can be done using breath tests, stool tests, or blood antibody tests, while in some cases, an endoscopy may be recommended to examine the stomach lining more closely. If the bacteria are detected, treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors to eradicate the infection and allow the stomach lining to heal. Although routine screening is not advised for populations in countries with low stomach cancer rates, high-risk individuals, including those with a family history, older adults, or people from regions with high prevalence, should undergo testing. Family members may also require evaluation, as the infection can spread within households. Early detection and timely treatment can prevent ulcers, reduce gastric cancer risk, and address a largely preventable cause of this disease.

A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6770596/"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; titled 'Sodium Intake and Hypertension' found on PubMed Central reads, "A reduction in salt intake can have a favourable effect on the cardiovascular system, inducing a reduction in BP values in hypertensive patients, but also with possible benefits in the vascular function and in the viscoelastic properties of the large arteries."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, avoid adding salt in cooking or reduce it from your diet as much as possible. Also, read food labels to identify hidden sodium (which is generally found in processed foods, sauces, canned meals) and avoid such foods. The goal is to reduce the “extra” salt you add, because even small reductions, like 1 teaspoon per day, can impact your BP, according to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/shaking-the-salt-habit-to-lower-high-blood-pressure"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:46:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>这种饮料可以修复你的肝脏，平衡荷尔蒙，甚至对抗癌症-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/this-one-drink-could-fix-your-liver-balance-hormones-and-even-fight-cancer/articleshow/124765863.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they might be extremely difficult and tiring to peel, and this may be the reason you've been avoiding adding them to your grocery list, pomegranates are one of the healthiest fruits out there.

They are said to have non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to understand whether gluten itself, or other factors, truly cause their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we did and what we found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study combined more than 58 studies covering symptom changes and possible ways they could arise. These included studying the immune system, gut barrier, microbes in the gut, and psychological explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across studies, gluten-specific reactions were uncommon and, when they occurred, changes in symptoms were usually small. Many participants who believed they were "gluten sensitive" reacted equally – or more strongly – to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="178903" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2013.04.051"&gt;One landmark trial&lt;/a&gt; looked at the role of fermentable carbohydrates (known as FODMAPs) in people who said they were sensitive to gluten (but didn't have coeliac disease). When people ate &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;a low-FODMAP diet&lt;/a&gt; – avoiding foods such as certain fruits, vegetables, legumes, and cereals – their symptoms improved, even when gluten was reintroduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.10.040"&gt;Another showed&lt;/a&gt; fructans – a type of FODMAP in wheat, onion, garlic, and other foods – caused more bloating and discomfort than gluten itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178919" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178919" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/onion_garlic_642.jpg" alt="onions and garlic" class="wp-image-178919 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/onion_garlic_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/onion_garlic_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178919" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A fermentable carbohydrate in onions and garlic caused more problems than gluten.

This could be FODMAPs such as fructans or other wheat proteins. Another explanation could be that symptoms reflect a disorder in how the gut interacts with the brain, similar to irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people may be truly sensitive to gluten. However, current evidence suggests this is uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;People expected symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A consistent finding is how expecting to have symptoms profoundly shapes people's symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(23)00317-5"&gt;In blinded trials&lt;/a&gt;, when people unknowingly ate gluten or placebo, symptom differences &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(25)00090-1"&gt;almost vanished&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some who expected gluten to make them unwell developed identical discomfort when exposed to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This nocebo effect – the negative counterpart of placebo – shows that belief and prior experience influence how the brain processes signals from the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118229"&gt;Brain-imaging research&lt;/a&gt; supports this, showing that expectation and emotion activate brain regions involved in pain and how we perceive threats. This can heighten sensitivity to normal gut sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are real physiological responses. What the evidence is telling us is that focusing attention on the gut, coupled with anxiety about symptoms or repeated negative experiences with food, has real effects. This can sensitise how the gut interacts with the brain (known as the gut–brain axis) so normal digestive sensations are felt as pain or urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178924" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/brain_scan_expectation_642.jpg" alt="brain scans" class="wp-image-178924 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/brain_scan_expectation_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/brain_scan_expectation_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178924" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Brain scans show expectation can activate regions involving pain. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADnBGtNmtE/"&gt;LarisaBozhikova/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising this psychological contribution doesn't mean symptoms are imagined. When the brain predicts a meal may cause harm, gut sensory pathways amplify every cramp or sensation of discomfort, creating genuine distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps explain why people remain convinced gluten is to blame even when blinded studies show otherwise. Symptoms are real, but the mechanism is often driven by expectation rather than gluten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what else could explain why some people feel better after going gluten-free? Such a change in the diet also reduces &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;high-FODMAP foods&lt;/a&gt; and ultra-processed products, encourages mindful eating and offers a sense of control. All these can improve our well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People also tend to eat more naturally gluten-free, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts, which may further support gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The cost of going gluten-free&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2017.06.037"&gt;approximately 1% of the population&lt;/a&gt; with coeliac disease, avoiding gluten for life is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for most who feel better gluten-free, gluten is unlikely to be the true problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a cost to going gluten-free unnecessarily. Gluten-free foods are, on average, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2024.02.051"&gt;139% more expensive&lt;/a&gt; than standard ones. They are also often lower in fibre and key nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding gluten long-term can also reduce diversity in your diet, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.03.017"&gt;alter your gut microbes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14258"&gt;reinforce anxiety about eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it worth getting tested?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike coeliac disease or a wheat allergy, non-coeliac gluten sensitivity has no biomarker – there's no blood test or tissue marker that can confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis instead relies on excluding other conditions and structured dietary testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our review, we recommend clinicians:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rule out coeliac disease and wheat allergy first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimise the quality of someone's overall diet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trial a low-FODMAP diet if symptoms persist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only then, consider a four to six-week dietitian-supervised gluten-free trial, followed by a structured reintroduction of gluten-containing foods to see whether gluten truly causes symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach keeps restriction targeted and temporary, avoiding unnecessary long-term exclusion of gluten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If gluten doesn't explain someone's symptoms, combining dietary guidance with psychological support often works best. That's because expectation, stress, and emotion influence our symptoms. Cognitive-behavioural or exposure-based therapies can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2014.01.007"&gt;reduce food-related fear&lt;/a&gt; and help people safely reintroduce foods they once avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This integrated model moves beyond the simplistic "gluten is bad" narrative toward personalised, evidence-based gut–brain care.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267098/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

"Choose organic produce when possible, use protective gear if you’re working with chemicals, and drink filtered water to avoid contaminants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 4: Prioritize sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During deep sleep, the brain clears out waste products and repairs itself, Michalopoulos noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chronic sleep deprivation or conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; can increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s," he said. "Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, avoid screens before bed and create a calming bedtime routine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/even-small-amounts-alcohol-linked-higher-dementia-risk-older-adults-study-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS OF ALCOHOL LINKED TO HIGHER DEMENTIA RISK IN OLDER ADULTS, STUDY SHOWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vibhash Sharma, a neurologist and medical director of UT Southwestern’s neuromodulation movement disorders clinic in Dallas, Texas, reiterated the importance of quality sleep for Parkinson’s prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As poor sleep quality and chronic sleep deprivation are associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, quality and adequate sleep is important for supporting brain repair and clearing abnormal proteins linked to Parkinson’s disease," he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 5: Manage stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress is a part of life, but &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;chronic levels&lt;/a&gt; can take a toll on your brain, Picone cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s been linked to inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which are thought to play a role in Parkinson’s," she said.

            A type of mosquito that was believed to have evolved in the London Underground has a much older origin in the Mediterranean, according to a new genetic study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00023d60cr43gqeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The myth originated during World War II when Londoners sheltering from German warplanes in subway stations had to endure bites from mosquitoes. The pests were so well adapted to the city’s subterranean tunnels that, in the following decades, biologists started to suggest they might have evolved down there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00033d608cjvbmpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The mosquito in question is commonly known as the northern house mosquito, and it exists in two forms, identical in appearance but different in behavior. One is called Culex pipiens form pipiens, which only bites birds and lives in open air environments, and the other is called Culex pipiens form&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;molestus — from the Latin word for annoying — which bites humans and thrives belowground.

            It was the latter variant, some biologists thought, that could have adapted to thrive in London’s Tube stations. “That theory was made really famous by a genetic study published in 1999, which claimed, based on what I would say was limited evidence, that the ‘London Underground mosquito’ seemed to have evolved (on site) from aboveground population,” said Yuki Haba, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and first author of the new study that &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ady4515?adobe_mc=MCMID=32040115521268807963986547309462626171%25257CMCORGID=242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%25252540AdobeOrg%25257CTS=1761227097" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the journal Science.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In the study, Haba and his colleagues analyzed the DNA sequences of hundreds of mosquitoes from all over the world, including some historical samples that were alive during World War II, and concluded that molestus did not rapidly evolve below the surface of the English capital but has a much longer history.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00063d60x4oyxi69@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a lot older than the London Tube, and it seems to have evolved around the Mediterranean region, particularly in the Middle Eastern region,” said Haba, adding that the split between the aboveground pipiens and the belowground molestus could have occurred as early as 10,000 years ago, and as late as 1,000 years ago, but most likely between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00073d60vfnq3jsn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The evolutionary analysis suggests that those ancestral molestus populations were aboveground,” he added, “and they kind of gradually dispersed to other places of the world, including the London Underground.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00093d602tlzq08j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The team’s quest to test the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis rigorously started in 2018. “We literally googled Culex pipiens and emailed every author of every paper that we found about the mosquito, telling them we needed samples to understand the origin and genetic diversity of the species,” Haba said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000a3d60avpflu6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thousands of emails and a few years later, the researchers had collected dead mosquitoes — preserved in ethanol — from more than 200 sources across 50 countries. They couldn’t get any live ones from the London Underground itself, as the scientists were denied permission to collect insects directly from the Tube. They instead used historical samples collected throughout the 1900s, conserved at London’s Natural History Museum and analyzed by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a genomics research center.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000b3d604zjes5f3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In total, the researchers analyzed 357 contemporary mosquitoes and 22 historical specimens, and used additional mosquito samples from a separate study, which beefed up the overall count to about 800.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000c3d60e5utgax3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our data shows that molestus is descended directly from pipiens populations that still thrive in the Mediterranean region,” said Lindy McBride, senior author of the study and an associate professor of evolutionary genomics and neuroscience at Princeton University. This finding suggests that it “evolved at Mediterranean latitudes, but probably in the Middle East, where it’s actually too arid for the bird-biting variant to exist.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000d3d60oxin9equ@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At roughly that time, people in the area were starting to create agricultural communities that used irrigation systems, providing ideal places for the mosquito to breed and enabling it to colonize these arid areas and then adapt to humans, McBride said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000e3d60k07xmk17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings are corroborated by the fact that molestus was first &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3426333/" target="_blank"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as a species in 1775 in Egypt by naturalist Peter Forsskål. “It had probably been there for 1,000 years, at least, before that,” McBride said. “It was then documented in southern Europe in two places, Croatia and Italy, in the 1800s and then the first records from belowground sites in Northern Europe are from about 1920.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000f3d60iryuy50o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This sequences of detection suggest that molestus traveled north, and once it hit climates too cold to survive in the open, it found refuge underground. “They can’t survive the cold winter, so they would have been confined to southern France, Italy, Greece, Spain,” McBride said. “They couldn’t have gotten much further north than that until there were underground structures to occupy during the winter.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000g3d6017nfk1ja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are over 3,000 species of mosquitoes, and they have by now colonized every continent except Antarctica. A mosquito was just found for the first time in Iceland, a country previously believed to be free of the insects due to its cold climate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Richard Nichols, a professor of genetics at Queen Mary University of London, was not involved with the research but was one of the authors of the 1999 paper that popularized the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis. Nichols said in an email that he thinks the new study is wonderful and convincing, and although it comes to different conclusions than his own research, “that’s how science works.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000j3d60rbhirb28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 1999 study, he continued, showed that the underground mosquitoes in London were genetically distinct from the aboveground populations, and had distinguishing characteristics that helped them live underground, such as the ability to go through the life cycle without a blood meal, indiscriminate biting when the opportunity arose, and an ability to mate in confined spaces and breed throughout the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000k3d604iio6tm7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We interpreted these results to imply that some of the above underground population had adapted to the London (Tube) system and become reproductively isolated from them,” he said, acknowledging that the data from the new study, which is sourced from more places and has greater genetic diversity, reveals new information that was not available at the time. “In those days we could only readily survey 20 genes — not whole genomes,” he explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000l3d60w124hfbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our results still stand, but the interpretation has changed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000m3d60vzsl76i8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cameron Webb, an associate professor of medical entomology at the University of Sydney and NSW Health Pathology in Australia, called it a fascinating and comprehensive study of the evolution of this globally important mosquito. “While often portrayed as having adapted specifically to the London Underground, this mosquito is actually well known to be associated with subterranean habitats around the world,” Webb, who was not involved with the work but has conducted research on molestus mosquitoes, wrote in an email. The study demonstrates the ancestral basis for the ability of this mosquito to exploit the London Underground, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000n3d6010wyn7z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The “London Underground mosquito” highlights the need to better understand the biology of less-studied mosquitoes to see how they may exploit the changing urban landscape and bring with them increased pest and public health concerns, Webb concluded. “As the design of our cities adapts in response to a changing climate, we must ensure we don’t create more opportunities for mosquitoes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

I have no underlying health issues except slightly high blood pressure. I have had all the COVID vaccines that have been offered. I did have a slight case of COVID in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I received the 2024-25 COVID vaccine on Aug. 1. Then they came up with an updated version for 2025-26. I would need to wait two months to get another vaccination. Is it worth getting the updated version to protect me this coming winter, or would this be "overkill"?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— C.R.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear C.R.:&lt;/strong&gt; The 2024-25 vaccine has activity against the variants of the COVID vaccine that are circulating now, so you did get some benefit from the vaccine. The 2025-26 vaccines are intended to provide better protection against the strains that are expected to circulate in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;At age 80, you are at an increased risk from COVID-19, but the fact that you have had all the vaccines, including the most recent one in August, does mean that you have protection from severe COVID. If you had an immune system disease, chronic heart/lung disease, or other conditions, I would definitely advise that you get the new vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The downside of getting the new vaccine as soon as possible is a sore arm and maybe foregoing additional protection in early 2026. You could get it now or in a few months if the amount of the virus is high in your community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you think of the Sinclair Method for dealing with an alcoholic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— M.D.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Naltrexone is approved for the treatment of alcohol use disorder under the Food and Drug Adminstration. (The terms "alcoholic" and "alcoholism" aren't used in a medical sense anymore. They seem to be judgmental and downplay the fact that this condition can be successfully treated.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Sinclair Method uses naltrexone, a medication that is often used for the treatment of opioid use disorder, to reduce the enjoyment people get with consuming alcohol, which makes for less cravings and more control over drinking. A major advantage of this method, which is used by many programs, is that it does not require total abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This can be beneficial for some people who feel awkward in social situations where drinking is considered normal. The treatment only works as long as people are using naltrexone. In the Sinclair Method, naltrexone is not necessarily given every day, only when a person is going into a situation where they will be drinking. This can be especially helpful in a person who intends to have one drink but ends up drinking more than they want to, especially when they "binge" (4 or more drinks for a woman, 5 or more for a man).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Naltrexone can be given every day by mouth or as an injection every four weeks. Although most people have few side effects, some side effects and liver problems can occur, so monitoring blood tests periodically is recommended when people are using naltrexone daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Naltrexone cannot be given to people who are being treated with opiates for pain as it will make the opiates ineffective. Naltrexone is also given to people with opioid use disorder for the very same reason it is used for alcohol: to reduce the pleasure "reward" from using it. It has been used in other situations as well, such as gambling and overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In my opinion, medication therapy is underused for people with moderate or severe alcohol use disorder. The long-term consequences of continued heavy drinking are immense for a person's physical and mental health, their social and family life, and employment. Naltrexone is one of several medications that are effective at helping people reduce or stop excess alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Many regular doctors are comfortable prescribing medication treatment for alcohol use disorder, but an addiction specialist is the expert in this case.&lt;em&gt; Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 09:02:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQcExfTmNwWWI4NFFGNWxsNnkwVTdTRzFray1DRFNQcHBRZzdOS09fMXNLNUo5TFpwYTUxV0NZMFpxUXRYaVZVdDRxUUVvTVAzaDVCM2pDaGJtNlNDTnVBRHpvRUNSUl9TUDJUNVBNYnZUUFpUN0lfOW9lbXQ5c2o3Y3Q3eENYeWhIZ2NSX09iY2FJVWhwN21ORXI5TlRkSGZRR28xR1B4T2tid3dNMzEzbVg0YW9iT1g4SUJnNEExcF9WNF9CVVhpWQ</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，即使鳞片没有移动， Semaglutide也能帮助您的心脏- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/semaglutide-helps-your-heart-even-if-the-scale-doesnt-budge-study-shows-2000676206</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The benefits of semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, aren’t just limited to treating obesity. New research shows that semaglutide can protect people’s hearts regardless of how many pounds they lose while taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists examined data from a large-scale clinical trial of people with obesity and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Compared to people on placebo, they found, those on semaglutide were less likely to develop heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems—even when people hadn’t lost much weight at all. The results indicate that semaglutide can improve heart health in more than one way, the researchers and outside experts say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings “highlight that the cardioprotective effects of semaglutide may be independent of adiposity and weight loss,” Laurence Sperling, a preventive cardiologist at Emory University not affiliated with the study, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Good for the heart&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide and other GLP-1 drugs have heralded a new era of obesity (and diabetes) treatment. But for a time, it was unclear if these drugs would also improve people’s cardiovascular health, and to what extent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk (the makers of Ozempic and Wegovy) funded a large, randomized, controlled, and double-blinded study designed to answer that open question—the SELECT trial. It involved roughly 17,000 people with obesity and a history of cardiovascular disease, who were followed for up to five years. The primary results from the SELECT trial, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; almost two years ago, showed that high-dose semaglutide (the version approved as Wegovy for treating obesity) reduced people’s risk of heart attacks and other major cardiovascular events by 20% during the study period. Based on these findings, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-reduce-risk-serious-heart-problems-specifically-adults-obesity-or"&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt; its approval of Wegovy to also cover the prevention of cardiovascular disease in high-risk groups.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since obesity is known to increase the risk of heart disease, it’s easy to assume that semaglutide’s heart benefits are mostly tied to helping people lose weight. But &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050173824000197"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; has already suggested it’s more complicated than that. In this new research, some of the researchers who conducted the SELECT trial took a closer look at their data.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They ultimately found no clear relationship between how much weight someone had lost early into the study (20 weeks in) and their reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The heart-protective benefits of semaglutide were also largely the same across different baseline weight groups. In other words, someone who was overweight (a body mass index between 27 and 30) at the start of the study tended to see a similar reduction in heart disease risk as compared to someone with the highest level of obesity (a BMI over 40).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This gives us important information that maybe we should be looking at the indication for these drugs beyond just whether your BMI is more than 27,” Howard Weintraub, preventive cardiologist and clinical director at the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart, told Gizmodo. Weintraub was one of the lead researchers of the original SELECT trial but wasn’t involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The study did see an association between someone’s waist circumference throughout the study and heart disease risk. The more a person’s waist shrunk, for instance, the greater reduction in risk they had. Waist circumference is another measure of excess body fat. So semaglutide’s slimming of body fat does seem to help explain why it prevents heart disease—but only partly. The researchers estimated that just a third of semaglutide’s effect on lowering cardiovascular disease could be accounted for by a trimming waistline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01375-3/fulltext"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in The Lancet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Beyond weight loss&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors say these findings could have far-reaching implications for how semaglutide and similar GLP-1 drugs should be used. If its heart benefits are largely independent of weight loss, then it wouldn’t be helpful to limit the prescribing of these drugs based solely on BMI. People taking semaglutide who lose enough weight to no longer qualify as obese might still benefit from continuing the drug for its heart-protective effects—just as those who don’t lose much weight may, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s even possible that GLP-1 therapy could one day be reframed as a standalone treatment for heart disease, regardless of BMI. Richard Kovacs, the interim chief of cardiovascular medicine at Indiana University’s School of Medicine, who is not involved with the study, notes that these findings could shape future guidelines in how doctors manage cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is a potential guideline changer because of its robust effect here. This is a well-run, large trial that we’re all familiar with. It’s an important analysis of it,” Kovacs, who is also the chief medical officer for the American College of Cardiology, told Gizmodo. At the same time, he adds, it would probably still take more data from at least one other large randomized trial for such a change to happen easily.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;One important question left to answer is exactly how these drugs can improve our heart health. The researchers argue that some of the drug’s protection likely stems from its anti-inflammatory effects, both on excess body fat and elsewhere. But the drug’s influence on blood sugar control or our blood vessels could also be playing a part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet another question is whether these heart-bolstering effects can be seen in people who aren’t overweight or obese—something that Kovacs suspects will be put to the test soon enough. And it’s still important to study whether similar benefits are apparent with other GLP-1 medications, including newer drugs that are combining GLP-1s with other compounds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, this research is continuing to demonstrate that there’s still so much left to learn about these already game-changing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we know everything that the GLP-1 agonists do yet,” Weintraub said. “So doctors will need to look at this beyond the prism of a TikTok video, where kids are looking to lose a couple of pounds to look better. That may certainly happen, but I think the cosmetic issues and the role of weight loss are just a small part of it. And as a cardiologist, I’m more motivated by the sort of findings we’re seeing here in reducing cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;
