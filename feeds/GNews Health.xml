class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Senior author, Prof Susan Davis, said while vasomotor symptoms (VMS) – such as hot flushes and night sweats – were already known to be typical of menopause, the study found moderate to severe VMS symptoms to be the most defining symptom of perimenopause, the time period leading up to the final menstrual period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a

email&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although other symptoms were commonly reported by perimenopausal women, including poor memory and low mood, analysis showed none differed in prevalence enough from pre-menopause to differentiate between menopausal stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study found 37.3% of women in late perimenopause had moderately-to-severely bothersome hot flushes: meaning they were five times more prevalent among perimenopausal women compared with pre-menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Severe vaginal dryness was 2.5 times more prevalent among perimenopausal women compared with pre-menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT, also known as HRT) is effective for treating VMS due to menopause, but there are no specifically designed or approved interventions for these symptoms for perimenopausal women, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Treating perimenopause is not the same as treating post-menopause because women are still randomly ovulating, contraception needs to be considered, MHT can make bleeding heavier and progesterone worsens PMS, Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study also challenged the assumption that menstrual irregularity is the earliest sign of perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297

findings support a more symptom-based approach&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Davis said it is common for women to ask their GPs if their heavier periods and hot flushes are a sign of perimenopause, only for the doctor to respond: “If you’re still getting regular cycles, you can’t possibly be perimenopausal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But when the study compared pre-menopausal women with VMS whose periods were still regular but had changes – becoming lighter or heavier – they were the same as women who had VMS but who’d started experiencing changes in period cycle frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“So we’re really saying ignoring hot flushes and night sweats is wrong,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Rakib Islam, also a study author, said defining perimenopause and menopause by menstrual cycle overlooks women with regular cycles and those who no longer menstruate, such as those who have had an endometrial ablation or hysterectomy, and users of hormonal contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our findings support a more symptom-based approach, enabling earlier recognition of perimenopause and more timely care,” Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Davis said it was “critical” that women were recruited to the study with no mention made of menopause, so the sample was not biased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="7d29c634-53f9-4005-b7a6-e3c586c4f681" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"

perimenopause, an area traditionally overlooked in menopause research,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“More than a third of research in medical treatments is done by pharmaceutical companies. They traditionally have excluded perimenopausal women from the research because the perimenopausal women are still producing their own hormones in a sometimes unpredictable way, and it didn’t fit with the study design that they wanted,” Hickey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hickey said the study’s main limitation was that it was a cross-sectional survey. So while it was helpful for knowing what symptoms women categorised to a particular stage might experience, “it doesn’t tell us how these things change as women go through menopause”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fae0a236-a446-475e-b0a6-e1a8d13ff22e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.EmbedBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="UnsafeEmbedBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"html":"&amp;lt;script src=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js\"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;","alt":"signup","index":25,"isTracking":false,"isMainMedia":false,"source":"The Guardian","sourceDomain":"uploads.guim.co.uk"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 22:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0AFBVV95cUxPdm4xUm5tLWZvTmpfSDlXVVRCUnFud2NqNFJFSTBnTUlYT0FpZzBraEh1a1BFS0hmcEZ6dlNraXJzc1lPdHFzUGtINEZwLTVNMXlVNWJneExFVzk0T3lnTVBNcTZacnhETkFRR3BPSlRPVnlGakw1R2pNSUdueEhuQWczZ0tLOWRmNjRwdzhwZWp6OEFpTThmQk9QZXV0Vk01MmEtblFzSDZwZFFGRGdDZkgwdXdQX3dFX2VBWjdEOV9Nc2RsZTZOR0w2UUpYSWFi</guid></item><item><title>随着弗吉尼亚州病例增加，您应该注意的皮疹- WTOP | The rash you should be on the lookout for as cases rise in Virginia - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxNejliM0t3V3hOYVM3WTh5bXl2NFBGNWFJZzFBM2JnY2tYeGZmV2MtR01leVdnN3ZwcXF1R2QyTWV1ZDVRa3NFTmJ4LURVQmh0NnpDU3hYQ0oyQU1oZC1GVFpzcVA1RHkzMEw0aXR0MlBmaFNmcll5MW9WWVZrVkwtMkZVdHBsQ2s4RDVldmxDdGJUdFhuRS01OGxTTTg0QU5jdXZ3ag?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;There has been an increase in the number of children in Fairfax County, Virginia, that are being diagnosed with Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;There has been an increase in the number of children in Fairfax County, Virginia, that are being diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/health/fairfax-health-district-sees-rise-in-reports-hand-foot-mouth-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a total of six cases in Fairfax County&lt;/a&gt;, five of those in the last two months, and health officials say it’s very contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing a lot of it right now,” said Tiffany Kimbrough, a pediatrician at the Children’s Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University. “It’s a common virus that we often see spread in the summer months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said it’s often seen in day care centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s spread through respiratory droplets, through drooling and contact with stools,” Kimbrough said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a rash on the hands and feet are a classic symptom, she said you can see it in other areas, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The blisters can be also in the diaper region, on the back of the throat. It can be really painful when you’re trying to eat and drink,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She recommended keeping you and your child as clean as possible with good hygiene routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Really good hand washing is important, especially after contact with any of the drool, after diaper changes or contact with any of the blisters, especially after they’ve popped,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the disease isn’t deadly, Kimbrough said you have to make sure your child isn’t getting dehydrated since sores often also show up on the back of the throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should check that your child is “making at least one wet diaper every eight hours is really the biggest thing, so that we can make sure they’re staying on top of their fluids,” she said. “Avoid things that are acidic or that might burn the back of the throat, and go for our bland, more boring things, just to make sure that we’re staying on top of fluids is really important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no medication that treats HFMD, but over-the-counter aspirins can help relieve the pain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After looking at the evidence, the research team concluded that there is &lt;span&gt;a positive correlation between erectile function and muscle health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They explained: 'Maintaining skeletal muscle with nutrition and physical activity improves erectile and overall health outcomes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Therapies that target sexual function and muscle health simultaneously (eg, testosterone and L-carnitine) may further benefit sexual function. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Future studies are warranted to strengthen and elucidate this relationship and to follow the longitudinal outcomes of these therapies on sexual health.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The link between erectile dysfunction and exercise isn't new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We published a paper about a year and a half ago, showing that exercise significantly reverses erectile dysfunction,' study co-author Dr Mohit Khera &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a65489108/strength-training-erectile-dysfunction/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Men's Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise can play a significant role in improving erectile dysfunction by positively impacting several key areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular physical activity can improve blood flow, reduce inflammation, manage weight, and address psychological factors, all of which contribute to erectile function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Khera added: 'While higher testosterone levels from strength training may play a minor role, the primary benefits are derived from improved vascular health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His past research found that &lt;span&gt;160 minutes of exercise a week, including strength training, significantly improved erectile function in men. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Notably, those with the most severe erectile dysfunction experienced the greatest improvements through regular exercise,' he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with working out, the researchers found diet can also play a role in erectile dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found L-carnitine, an amino acid found in red meat, poultry, and fish, may help work as a remedy for ED, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erectile dysfunction is very common and often affects men over 40 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, more than 3.5 million prescriptions for sildenafil (the active ingredient in Viagra) were filled in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most men struggle to get or keep an erection at some point. This can be caused by stress, fatigue or drinking too much alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, if it is a frequent occurrence, it may be a result of high blood pressure or cholesterol, diabetes, depression or anxiety and hormones problems, and is something that can be discussed with a healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drugs on the market for ED include Viagra, which is part of a drug class called PDE5 inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They work by blocking an enzyme that restricts blood flow to the penis, by blocking it, the normal function can resume and the penis can be become erect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Erectile dysfunction is very common and often affects men over 40 years old. In the US, more than 3.5 million prescriptions for sildenafil (the active ingredient in Viagra) were filled in 2022 (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Side effects can include headaches, sickness, hot flushes, indigestion, a stuffy nose or feeling dizzy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over recent years, health experts have warned of a staggering rise in erectile problems in young men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14784297/Warning-erectile-problems-young-men-habit-online.html"&gt;doctors, watching pornography is driving a wave of erectile dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UK-based Dr Babak Ashrafi said there had been an 46 percent increase in men under the age of 30 currently seeking help for erectile dysfunction compared to last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Babak said a spike in younger men experiencing the problem could be linked to the 'exponential' consumption of explicit online material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Despite men between the ages of 45 and 54 being the most likely to suffer from erectile difficulties, younger male audiences are increasingly requesting treatment,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Babak explained that while occasional pornography viewing was harmless, frequent or marathon sessions could retrain men's brains and prevent them from becoming aroused normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Repeated overexposure to graphic content can over time make it harder for individuals to become aroused by real-life sexual experiences,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family doctor added that porn could also be giving men unrealistic perceptions about their manhood, or how long they should last in bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It is unclear which strain the woman was diagnosed with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically contracted through infected saliva and genital fluids, the herpetic whitlow infection can also &lt;span&gt;be transmitted through contaminated objects such as shared nail tools or medical equipment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure flare ups resulting in open sores and blisters may occur. Treatment plans are usually focused on dealing with symptoms and preventing the spread of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 23-year-old woman has sued a Portland nail salon after she claims a treatment left her with a herpetic whitlow infection (pictured)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to The Oregonian/&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/oregon/index.html" id="mol-50707c30-6973-11f0-82ee-91d45b155eb9" class=""&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; Live, the plaintiff claims in her lawsuit that the nail technician did not wear gloves during the service and &lt;span&gt;stored her manicure tools in an Altoids mints tin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also states that did not suffer from the condition in any capacity before receiving the manicure at the salon. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A herpetic whitlow infection is typically caused by the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) which also causes cold sores or herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), which can cause genital herpes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The virus can be transmitted through contact with an active herpes lesion, like a cold sore or through contact with infected saliva or genital secretions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The contagious infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; can cause painful blisters, swelling, and redness, often on the fingertip or around the nail bed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, it can cause a fever and swollen lymph nodes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The early stages of the infection include pain and a tingling sensation on your finger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within days, blisters form near your fingernail, which makes skin to be tender and sensitive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the infection progresses, a crust will form as it continues drying and healing. Most cases of herpetic whitlow affect one finger but it can spread to other fingers too depending on the severity of the infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A doctor can usually diagnose herpetic whitlow based on the appearance of the lesions and the patient's symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The woman claims that the nail technician stored her manicure tools in an Altoids mints tin (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To confirm the diagnosis, experts may also test a sample of parts of the skin that have been affected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A herpetic whitlow infection usually resolves on its own but may require an antiviral prescription to help the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Medications such as acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir can help shorten the duration and severity of the infection, especially when started early.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Compresses and bandages on the fingers can also help prevent a secondary infection from the virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But while a typical herpetic whitlow infection lasts about two weeks, the 23-year-old claims hers has lasted years in continuation as the virus has flared up multiple times. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Due to the infection's contagious nature, as well as the pain her in hands, the woman said she has been forced to repeatedly bandage her fingers to prevent the virus from spreading to others while she is out in public. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A herpetic whitlow infection usually resolves on its own but may require an antiviral prescription to help the process (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;She told The Oregonian/Oregon Live: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'The flare-ups can be super, super painful. It's always on my mind.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People have asked "What happened to your finger?" I don't want to tell them what it really is because it's really embarrassing.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the lawsuit, she was seeking $1.75 million from the salon claiming negligence and unlawful trade practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, according to The Oregonian/Oregon Live, the patient and salon have now reached a confidential settlement with the business &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Details of the settlement have not been revealed.

Here's The Science.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how much sleep do we need? And what can sleeping a lot really tell us about our health? Let's unpack the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep is essential for our health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with nutrition and physical activity, sleep is an essential pillar of health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During sleep, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2023.02.005"&gt;physiological processes&lt;/a&gt; occur that allow our bodies to function effectively when we are awake. These include processes involved in muscle recovery, memory consolidation and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-topics/how-much-sleep-do-you-really-need"&gt;Sleep Health Foundation&lt;/a&gt; – Australia's leading not-for-profit organization that provides evidence-based information on sleep health – recommends adults get seven to nine hours of sleep per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people are naturally &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-do-some-people-need-less-sleep-than-others-a-gene-variation-could-have-something-to-do-with-it-256342"&gt;short sleepers&lt;/a&gt; and can function well with less than seven hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, for most of us, sleeping less than seven hours will have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S134864"&gt;negative effects&lt;/a&gt;. These may be short term; for example, the day after a poor night's sleep you might have less energy, worse mood, feel more stressed and find it harder to concentrate at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long term, not getting enough good quality sleep is a &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.26918"&gt;major risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for health problems. It's linked to a higher risk of developing &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.26918"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; – such as heart attacks and stroke – &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2011.00990.x"&gt;metabolic disorders&lt;/a&gt;, including type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="169091" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, poor &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30136-X"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="169091" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety, &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.10932"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/33/5/585/2454478"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it's clear that not getting enough sleep is bad for us. But what about too much sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169104" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169104" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/syahdan-fadillah-wk1Nfxjr2C0-unsplash-e1753419129883.jpg" alt="Man sleeping on public transport" class="wp-image-169104 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169104" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;What if your body just can't seem to get enough of sleep? (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/man-wearing-eyeglasses-wk1Nfxjr2C0"&gt;syahdan fadillah/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Could too much sleep be bad?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01592-y"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers reviewed the results of 79 other studies that followed people for at least one year and measured how sleep duration impacts the risk of poor health or dying to see if there was an overall trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found people who slept for short durations – less than seven hours a night – had a 14 percent higher risk of dying in the study period, compared to those who slept between seven and eight hours. This is not surprising given the established health risks of poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers also found those who slept a lot – which they defined as more than nine hours a night – had a greater risk of dying: 34 percent higher than people who slept seven to eight hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This supports similar research from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.118.008552"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, which combined results from 74 previous studies that followed the sleep and health of participants across time, ranging from one to 30 years. It found sleeping more than nine hours was associated with a 14 percent increased risk of dying in the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has also shown sleeping too long (meaning more than required for your age) is linked to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S163071"&gt;health problems&lt;/a&gt; such as depression, chronic pain, weight gain and metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may sound alarming. But it's crucial to remember these studies have only found a link between sleeping too long and poor health – this doesn't mean sleeping too long is the &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; of health problems or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what's the link?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple factors may influence the relationship between sleeping a lot and having poor health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18945686/"&gt;common&lt;/a&gt; for people with chronic health problems to consistently sleep for long periods. Their bodies may need additional rest to support recovery, or they may spend more time in bed due to symptoms or medication side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with chronic health problems may also not be getting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.10.028"&gt;high quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and may stay in bed for longer to try and get some extra sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we know &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18945686/"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for poor health, such as smoking and being overweight, are also associated with poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means people may be sleeping more &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of existing health problems or lifestyle behaviors, not that sleeping more is causing the poor health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, sleeping may be a symptom of poor health, not the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What's the ideal amount?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons some people sleep a little and others sleep a lot depend on &lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-topics/how-much-sleep-do-you-really-need"&gt;individual differences&lt;/a&gt; – and we don't yet fully understand these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our sleep needs can be related to age. &lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-topics/teenage-sleep"&gt;Teenagers&lt;/a&gt; often want to sleep more and may physically need to, with sleep recommendations for teens being slightly higher than adults at eight to ten hours. Teens may also go to bed and wake up later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults may want to spend more time in bed. However, unless they have a sleep disorder, the amount they need to sleep &lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-topics/ageing-sleep"&gt;will be the same&lt;/a&gt; as when they were younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most adults will require seven to nine hours, so this is the healthy window to aim for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just about how much sleep you get. Good quality sleep and a consistent bed time and wake time are just as important – &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352721823001663"&gt;if not more so&lt;/a&gt; – for your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15402002.2021.1876693"&gt;many Australian adults&lt;/a&gt; are not receiving the recommended amount of sleep, we should focus on how to make sure we get enough sleep, rather than worrying we are getting too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give yourself the best chance of a &lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-topics/sleep-hygiene-good-sleep-habits"&gt;good night's sleep&lt;/a&gt;, get sunlight and stay active during the day, and try to keep a regular sleep and wake time. In the hour before bed, avoid screens, do something relaxing, and make sure your sleep space is quiet, dark, and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice you are regularly sleeping much longer than usual, it could be your body's way of telling you something else is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're struggling with sleep or are concerned, speak with your GP.

                        &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;img class="fr-fic fr-dib" src="https://accessglobal.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/uploads/froala_editor/images/How%20Much%20Vitamin%20D%20for%20ED.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ED the lack of ability to attain or keep an erection adequate for erotic performance, impacts hundreds of thousands of guys worldwide. While reasons of ED vary from psychological stress to cardiovascular ailment and diabetes, current lookup has explored the viable position of diet D in aiding erotic health. This article dives into how a good deal diet D can also be recommended for guys with erectile dysfunction, what the science says, and how to use it safely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Link Between Vitamin D and ED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is mainly produced in the skin following exposure to sunlight. It also plays a critical role in many bodily processes, including immune support, bone health, hormone regulation, and vascular function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vitamin D receptors are found in endothelial cells, which line blood vessels and regulate vascular tone. Low vitamin D levels are associated with increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction—all of which can impair penile blood flow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ED is often managed with medications like sildenafil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eonlinepharmacystore.com/cenforce-100-mg-sildenafil"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cenforce 100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; At the same time, interest is growing in how &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;vitamin D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; might support erogenous health, particularly in men with low vitamin D levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A number of studies have shown that men with low vitamin D levels are more likely to suffer from ED. For instance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 2015 study published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Atherosclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that men with vitamin D deficiency were more likely to have severe ED.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A meta-analysis published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The World Journal of Men's Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 2020 suggested that vitamin D supplementation could moderately improve erectile function, particularly in those with documented deficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For Men with Low Vitamin D or ED Symptoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clinical trials and expert recommendations suggest higher doses may be more effective for restoring optimal blood levels and potentially supporting erectile function:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2,000 to 4,000 IU daily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is often used in studies without reported adverse effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In cases of confirmed deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL), doctors may recommend &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;50,000 IU weekly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; for 6–8 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Endocrine Society sets the upper safe limit at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;10,000 IU daily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, though long-term high doses should only be taken under medical supervision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="177056"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your levels are low, supplementation can help—not just for ED, but for overall cardiovascular and hormonal health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mechanisms: How Vitamin D May Help Erectile Function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Improved Endothelial Function: Vitamin D promotes nitric oxide production, a key molecule in initiating and sustaining an erection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="177057"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reduced Inflammation: Chronic inflammation can damage blood vessels; vitamin D’s anti-inflammatory effects may reduce this risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Boosting Testosterone: Low testosterone is a known contributor to ED. Some studies show that vitamin D may help raise testosterone levels in men with low D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Improved Mood and Reduced Depression: Depression and stress are significant psychological contributors to ED. Vitamin D may improve mood through its effect on brain neurotransmitters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="177058"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get Tested First: Measure vitamin D levels via a blood test (25(OH)D). Use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eonlinepharmacystore.com/cenforce-100-mg-sildenafil"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cenforce 100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;sildenafil as Needed: For erotic activity; avoid daily use unless prescribed. Use Vitamin D Daily: Consistency matters; results appear gradually over weeks or months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To avoid these complications, stick to doses &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;below 4,000 IU daily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; unless prescribed otherwise by a physician. Periodic blood testing is crucial if taking higher doses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lifestyle Factors That Enhance Vitamin D and Sexual Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="177059"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sunlight: Just 15–30 minutes of midday sun on your face, arms, or legs can help your body produce adequate vitamin D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diet: Fatty fish (like salmon), egg yolks, and fortified foods contain small amounts of vitamin D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exercise: Regular physical activity improves blood flow, testosterone, and mood—all factors that influence erectile function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="177060"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Weight management: Obesity is linked to low vitamin D and ED; losing excess weight can help normalize both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Final Thoughts: How Much Should You Take?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re experiencing ED and suspect low vitamin D may be a contributing factor, consider:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Getting tested first to determine your vitamin D status.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If deficient (&amp;lt;30 ng/mL): Consider 2,000–4,000 IU daily, or a higher dose under supervision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If adequate: Maintaining a daily intake of 1,000–2,000 IU is safe and may support vascular and hormonal health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vitamin D isn't a magic pill for ED, but in men with low levels, supplementation may offer a modest but meaningful improvement—especially when paired with broader lifestyle changes and medical guidance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;Following tests on mosquitoes for West Nile Virus, the Metropolitan Mosquito Control District reported that virus activity is increasing, earlier than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Metropolitan Mosquito Control District (MMCD) said &lt;em&gt;Culex tarsalis&lt;/em&gt;, the mosquito species most responsible for transmitting WNV to humans, was active in some of the highest numbers ever recorded by the organization.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MMCD lab tested 133 mosquito pools and found 34 were positive for WNV, over 25% of the tested pools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MMCD warns a positive test was also found in the seven counties they monitor, which include Hennepin, Ramsey, Anoka, Washington, Dakota, Scott and Carver counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the highest positivity rates ever recorded in July and is more typical with late August when the mosquito populations are winding down,” MMCD said in a statement. “With the elevated risk of West Nile virus, it is important that residents take steps to protect themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MMCD advises residents to wear an EPA-registered insect repellent, wear long sleeves and pants that have light colors and are loose, remove stagnant water and avoid the outdoors during peak mosquito activity hours surrounding dawn and dusk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information on WNV can be found on the &lt;a href="https://mmcd.org/west-nile-virus/"&gt;MMCD website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s world, allergies are nearly unavoidable. For instance, a report from Stanford Medicine suggests that &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/allergyandasthma/clinical-care/learn-about-allergies.html"&gt;nearly 40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the human population (over three billion people) suffers from at least one allergic condition, making allergies one of the most widespread health issues globally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The situation is even worrisome in the US, where over 50 percent of all kids suffer from this problem. However, surprisingly,  there’s one group in America that seems almost immune to allergies, &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/gene-mutation-common-amish-community-might-extend-lifespan-10-years/"&gt;the Amish&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the earlier 50 percent figure, only seven percent of Amish kids have developed any allergic condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, “generally, across the country, about 8 to 10 percent of kids have asthma. In the Amish kids, it’s probably 1 to 2 percent. A few of them do have allergies, but at much, much lower rates compared to the general population,” Carole Ober, an expert on human genetics from the University of Chicago, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/07/20/allergies-amish-hygiene-thesis/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These numbers are so incredible that scientists are now digging deep into Amish barns and homes to understand how these children are being protected. They believe that their findings could lead to treatments that prevent &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/gene-mutation-common-amish-community-might-extend-lifespan-10-years/"&gt;allergies altogether&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-secret-to-allergy-resistance-in-the-amish"&gt;The secret to allergy resistance in the Amish&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amish are a group of people in the United States and parts of Canada who live a very simple, traditional lifestyle and mainly &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/crops-future-farming-robots-9432432/"&gt;rely on farming&lt;/a&gt; and livestock for their livelihood. They still ride horse buggies and typically stay away from modern gadgets such as TVs and smartphones. In recent years, the mystery behind the Amish resistance to allergies led scientists from several universities to compare the Amish with other traditional farming groups, particularly the Hutterites. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both groups have similar ancestry and lifestyles. However, only Amish children showed extremely low allergy and asthma rates. This finding suggested that genetics isn’t the answer. Something else is at play here. So the researchers looked at how children in each group interacted with their environment. They found a major difference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Hutterite kids and pregnant moms don’t go into the animal barns. Kids aren’t really exposed to the animal barns until they’re like 12 or so, when they start learning how to do the work on the farm. The Amish kids are in and out of the cow barns all day long from an early age,” Ober said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When scientists analyzed dust samples from Amish and Hutterite homes, they discovered that Amish house dust had nearly seven times more microbes. To test whether this made a difference, they exposed mice to each type of dust. Mice that inhaled Amish dust showed much less inflammation in their airways when &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/could-a-cure-for-allergies-be-right-around-the-corner-research-suggests-so/"&gt;exposed to allergens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whereas mice exposed to Hutterite dust didn’t get that benefit. This strongly suggested that early, regular exposure to certain farm microbes trained the immune system of Amish kids to react calmly instead of aggressively to substances like pollen or food. This phenomenon is called the farm effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish.jpg"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-750x500.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-1140x760.jpg 1140w,https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-1024x683.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-750x500.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Amish.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" class="wp-image-287596 sp-no-webp" alt="" decoding="async"&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Amish men and women walking near a river.

&lt;p&gt;In a further &lt;a href="https://archive.is/o/gJZKp/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674923007066"&gt;study in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, scientists took it a step further and identified special proteins in Amish dust. These proteins act like transporters, carrying microbial and plant molecules straight into the airways, where they help regulate immune responses. In short, early exposure to the barn dust (farm effect) creates a shield inside the body, one that keeps &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/womans-nut-allergy-triggered-after-sex-in-bizarre-first/"&gt;allergy-triggering&lt;/a&gt; reactions from spiraling out of control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These clues about the origin of the farm effect represent a step toward the prevention of allergic diseases,” Kirsi Järvinen-Seppo, Chief of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at the University of Rochester Medical Center, told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-time-to-attack-allergies-before-they-appear"&gt;Time to attack allergies before they appear&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, most allergy treatments, like inhalers for asthma or antihistamines for hay fever, only manage symptoms. This is because they are typically administered after the allergy has already taken hold in the body. However, what we truly need is something that could prevent the onset of allergies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obviously, every household can not &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/ecology/animals-ecology/cow-therapy-animals/"&gt;have a barn&lt;/a&gt;, but by studying the microbes responsible for the farm effect, scientists believe it is possible to replicate the protective effect of the Amish environment. For instance, they could develop proactive solutions, such as probiotics, nasal sprays, or even dust-derived treatments that train a child’s immune system in the early years of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know that we can give every family a cow. But we are learning from these time-honored and very stable environments what type of substances and exposures are needed. Once we know that, I don’t think there will be any impediment to creating protective strategies along these lines,” Donata Vercelli, an expert in molecular biology at the University of Arizona, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that something as simple as barn dust could protect millions of children is both fascinating and hopeful. However, to realize this at full scale, researchers now need to identify exactly &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/biology/the-strangest-microbe-ever-found-staddles-the-line-between-life-and-non-life/"&gt;which microbes&lt;/a&gt; and molecules provide the strongest protection, and they must ensure any treatment is both safe and easy to use. &lt;/p&gt;

After monitoring her for half an hour, a nurse gave her a shot to try to stop her hemorrhaging. It didn’t work. The doctor ordered some bloodwork and made a startling discovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d7487f" class="body-graf"&gt;“We’re just admiring our new baby and soaking it all in,” Hilmer, 34, of Marion, Iowa, recalls to TODAY.com. “The doctor said, ‘The labs came back from the sample that I just sent off, and it came back positive for acute leukemia.’ And I didn’t know what acute meant. All I heard was leukemia.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-567b58" class="body-graf"&gt;Hilmer couldn’t believe it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8b855" class="body-graf"&gt;“I froze,” she says. “My fiancé and I stared at each other in shock and in disbelief with eyes wide open.

Her bloodwork didn’t reveal any red flags, and she felt good. During the last month she was pregnant, she started experiencing “pretty intense pains.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c515e3" class="body-graf"&gt;“The pains would radiate from down my arms or starting at my lower back all the way down to my legs,” she says. “I thought that those were sciatica pains because sciatica is pretty common in pregnant women, especially towards the end.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-09a815"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1996"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-01-2f7273.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-01-2f7273.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-01-2f7273.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-01-2f7273.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-01-2f7273.jpg" alt="Grappling with new motherhood and a cancer diagnosis at the same time felt tough.

Hoping for help, she visited the emergency room, and they assured her that she was experiencing “pregnancy pains.” On October 22, 2022, Hilmer went into labor at home and went to the hospital “expecting to have a completely normal and healthy delivery.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-223f22" class="body-graf"&gt;“The delivery was fine,” she says. “It’s obviously common to be losing blood after delivery.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00f15b" class="body-graf"&gt;When the nurses checked on her, though, they noticed Hilmer was bleeding more than normal, but they decided to monitor her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc769c" class="body-graf"&gt;“This went on for I want to say roughly 30 minutes to an hour of the nurses pressing on my stomach and measuring and keeping track of how much blood I was losing,” she says. “I was hemorrhaging … I was losing so much blood.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-26b2de" class="body-graf"&gt;A nurse administered medication to slow the bleeding. But she continued bleeding heavily. Doctors considered sending her for a hysterectomy to stop it. However, the doctor who performed the delivery first opted for blood work to see if that could reveal what was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-55f5b7" class="body-graf"&gt;Then the doctor returned and explained to Hilmer that she had acute myeloid leukemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-33436c" class="body-graf"&gt;“I was like, ‘Are you telling me that I have cancer?’” she recalls. “He’s like, ‘Yes, unfortunately that’s what the labs show.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed120c" class="body-graf"&gt;Hilmer was stunned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-192b17" class="body-graf"&gt;“I really was like, ‘Are you sure that’s true? Is there any chance that it’s wrong?’” she says. “And the doctor said, ‘No, your platelet counts were dangerously low, and that is why you were losing so much blood.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52b77e" class="body-graf"&gt;The doctor informed her that they were transferring her to the University of Iowa “without (her) baby, without anybody.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fd30f" class="body-graf"&gt;“I was obviously hormonal due to just having a baby, and then I get this news of a cancer diagnosis,” she says. “So not only was I scared.

At one point, she needed oxygen because she developed pneumonia from COVID-19, and breathing became difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70addb" class="body-graf"&gt;“That was awful,” Hilmer says. “I really, really wanted to be able to breastfeed my baby and, of course, I could not because I was receiving chemotherapy … that honestly broke my heart.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7234b2" class="body-graf"&gt;After she went home, she visited a local hospital for bloodwork so doctors could track her health. She needed to undergo blood and platelet transfusions "multiple times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-739f7f" class="body-graf"&gt;“I had to continuously get those a lot because if your counts are below a certain number, it’s dangerous,” Hilmer explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8015d7" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors hoped she could undergo a stem cell transplant to fully treat her cancer, but they needed to find a donor. She underwent a round of maintenance chemotherapy as she waited for her transplant and by January 2023, they found a match. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-85e5e6" class="body-graf"&gt;“They told me around 60ish percent of the (blood) cells in my body were cancerous and that’s considered moderate to high risk,” she says. “They thought it was important for me to get the stem cell transplant in order to have the best chance of non-relapsing and not having the cancer come back.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bddf62" class="body-graf"&gt;She returned to University of Iowa Health Care and underwent a “potent” round of chemotherapy to kill off as many cancer cells as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bbf45c" class="body-graf"&gt;“That was pretty rough,” she says. “All of my donor’s healthy, non-cancerous cells (were) infused into my body and basically took the place of my old cells that they got rid of with chemotherapy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-605ead" class="body-graf"&gt;After recovering in the hospital for a few weeks, Hilmer returned home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ff6c0b" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was a successful transplant,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a8aa7b" class="body-heading"&gt;Acute Myeloid Leukemia &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9a9b9a" class="body-graf"&gt;While acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can occur at any age, the average age of diagnosis is about 70, says Dr. David Dickens.

Other symptoms include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-1c0512" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unusual bleeding or bruising&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-a12dbe" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/mom-40-diagnosed-leukemia-kids-pediatrician-spotted-skin-changes-rcna117374" target="_blank"&gt;off-color&lt;/a&gt; to their skin &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-a13846" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fevers without an illness &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d0642" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re not having any cold symptoms and you feel the lymph nodes, that might be a sign,” he says. “No patient has zero signs. No patient has all of it. It’s usually somewhere in the middle.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0d34d8" class="body-graf"&gt;Many of the symptoms, though, can be easily mistaken for something else. Loads of people feel exhausted and that’s not a sign that they have cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b055b" class="body-graf"&gt;Treatments for leukemia typically involve chemotherapy and, in some cases, a stem cell transplant, also called a bone marrow transplant. For people with some genetic mutations of AML, doctors believe a stem cell transplant is more effective treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-feb0e9" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you have one of those genetic mutations and you’re young enough to be able to tolerate it … doctors might prescribe a bone marrow transplant,” Dickens explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c80b7d" class="body-graf"&gt;While Hilmer’s diagnosis was uncommon, Dickens says it was wise that her doctor ran bloodwork before considering the hysterectomy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-afe41d" class="body-graf"&gt;“Anybody who might be worried about (excessive bleeding should) take a blood count. It’s easy enough,” Dickens says. “There could be a lot of different reasons why somebody would have abnormal bleeding that isn’t leukemia, but that test will definitely pick up leukemia if it happens.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-448e06" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Miracle Baby’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-919b21" class="body-graf"&gt;Since undergoing her transplant in 2023, Hilmer’s leukemia has not returned. At her six-week postpartum check-up, the doctor who delivered Banks revealed to her that if they had proceeded with the hysterectomy without bloodwork, the outcome would have been very different. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-661c02" class="body-graf"&gt;“He told me that I likely would have bled out during surgery,” she says. “I would not have survived.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-954989" class="body-graf"&gt;Banks is also doing well, and Hilmer and her fiancé gave him a special nickname. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f4dd6" class="body-graf"&gt;“We like to think of Banks as our miracle baby because if I wasn’t pregnant and if I didn’t have him it’s (unclear) how long my cancer would have gone undiagnosed,” Hilmer says. “If I had gone a month or two, even longer, without being diagnosed, there’s a solid chance I wouldn’t be here.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2f7a69" class="body-graf"&gt;Last month, however, Hilmer received some devastating news —she has Stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma breast cancer. She’ll soon undergo a double mastectomy to treat it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-01f39e"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1785"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-05-7bd32e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-05-7bd32e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-05-7bd32e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-05-7bd32e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/post-delivery-bleeding-sign-of-cancer-zz-250725-05-7bd32e.jpg" alt="Danika Hilmer calls her son, Banks, her 'miracle baby' because he helped her receive a cancer diagnosis quickly.

              &lt;p&gt;Dozens of restaurant goers in Wisconsin had the sort of meal you wouldn’t ever forget. A recent case report details how they were accidentally fed food made with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary ingredient in cannabis responsible for getting you high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Local health officials described the sitcom-like shenanigans in a report &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7427a2.htm"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Nearly 100 customers ate the restaurant’s THC-laced food in late October, some of whom visited the hospital as a result. The source of the “outbreak” was eventually traced back to THC-infused cooking oil mistaken for ordinary canola oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Clinicians and public health practitioners should be alert to the possibility of mass THC intoxication events via food,” the report authors, from Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County, wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the trouble (or fun, depending on your perspective) began sometime on October 22. Over the next three days, at least 85 people between the ages of 1 and 91 became intoxicated shortly after eating at the restaurant, including seven people who were sent to a local hospital with symptoms like dizziness, sleepiness, and anxiety. One individual was advised to call Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County; the person reported they had tested positive for THC without any known exposure and that they had eaten at the restaurant the day before, prompting further investigation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On October 24, officials contacted the restaurant’s owner, who agreed to immediately shut the place down. That same day, the owner called back and reported that the restaurant was in a building with a cooperative (shared) kitchen used by another business that produced THC edibles derived from hemp. The owner also reported that on October 22, the restaurant ran out of its cooking oil and began using oil from the shared kitchen—which the owner assumed was simply canola oil—to make the dough for its pizzas, sandwiches, and other bread-filled goods. A large oil container in the same area where the borrowed oil was found was then tested and found positive for THC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials brought in the local police for help, who determined that the restaurant’s THC contamination was indeed an accident, and no criminal charges were filed against the owner or others. It also appears no one was seriously hurt as a result. After a thorough cleaning, the restaurant opened back up on October 26.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As funny as all this sounds, anyone who’s mistakenly bitten into an edible or knows someone who has (&lt;em&gt;ahem&lt;/em&gt;) can attest that it isn’t always a picnic to deal with, even if the effects are ultimately temporary. The victims also included eight children, three who experienced vomiting and one who even developed hallucinations. Thankfully, none of them were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report authors say more should be done to prevent these sorts of incidents, given the rising popularity of THC and cannabis-centered businesses, especially if the businesses share space with restaurants. “Regulations regarding practices such as standard, clear labeling and locked storage for ingredients containing THC, might decrease the risk for unintentional THC exposure at licensed food businesses,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m just wondering if the incident lowered or boosted the restaurant’s Yelp rating.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While laws around surrogates, or “gestational carriers”, vary around the world, the practice is booming. According to Global Market Insights, the market is expected to grow from $27.9bn (£20.8bn) in 2025 to $201.8bn (£150.2bn) in 2034.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our findings underscore the importance of adequate screening and counselling of potential gestational carriers before pregnancy about the possibility of a new-onset mental illness, or exacerbation of a prior mental illness during or after pregnancy,” said Dr Maria Velez, the first author of the research, from McGill University in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. “As well, the provision of support during and after pregnancy may be particularly important for gestational carriers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.23428" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Jama Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, Velez and colleagues report how they analysed data from 767,406 births in Ontario that occurred between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Of these, 748,732 involved unassisted conceptions, 758 involved surrogacy, and the others involved &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ivf" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;IVF&lt;/a&gt; in mothers who carried their own babies. Velez said the vast majority of surrogacy cases in Canada involved the surrogate being unrelated to the child, meaning the surrogate’s eggs were not used in conception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among those excluded from this initial analysis were women with a record of mental illness prior to the estimated date of conception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team analysed the number of women in each group who received a diagnosis of a new-onset mental illness since the estimated date of conception, such as anxiety disorder, mood disorder, self-harm or psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These diagnoses occurred in 236 surrogates, 195,022 women who had an unassisted conception and 4,704 women who had received IVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After accounting for factors such as age, income, smoking and number of children, this corresponded to a 43% and 29% higher incidence rate of new mental illness per 100 people per year of follow-up in surrogates compared with women who had an unassisted conception or IVF, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For all three groups, mood or anxiety disorder was the most common diagnosis, while median time from conception to diagnosis was similar, at about two and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers found the risk of new mental illness remained elevated in surrogates, but to a lesser degree, when compared with women who had an unassisted conception but no longer lived with their child a year after the birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The finding might suggest that some gestational carriers may experience grief from relinquishing their newborn, like that described after adoption or removal of the child into foster care – something that needs further studies,” said Velez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team then carried out further analyses that included women with a previous record of mental illness and found all groups in this category had a higher rate of new-onset mental illness than those with no previous record. Despite Canada requiring would-be surrogates to undergo psychological assessments, the results revealed 19% of surrogates in the study had a documented diagnosis of mental illness before pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study follows &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/sep/23/surrogates-face-higher-risk-of-pregnancy-complications-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; by the team that found surrogates were more likely to experience complications including severe postpartum haemorrhage and severe pre-eclampsia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Zaina Mahmoud, an expert on the socio-legal aspects of surrogacy at the University of Liverpool, in England, who was not involved in the work, said further research was needed to explore whether the greater risk of new mental illness in surrogates was down to the pregnancy itself, and the mechanisms at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“[The researchers are] not addressing why or how surrogates have these emotional trajectories,” she said, adding that the team had used very broad definitions of mental illness. “They hypothesise that grief from relinquishing the infant may contribute, but they don’t actually measure that grief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But Mahmoud backed the call for greater screening and support for potential surrogates, saying the work suggested support should last for more than two years after the birth. The studies “really highlight the need for robust information and consent procedures”, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>theguardian.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 15:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxOMjBoZDRjTkllRVhSWkN5TVZLTWJTanhza2xBLVpCTGd1dnZFRG13dVpKMG95dnVYVlhPemt1YUFReXR3WE1sVUhTNGJjMXBwZVZscko2dzczNVJtQ0dfeTRFd0k2ZmZYX0lDZW1VYkVuS2J4dzlxWktuM0QwWmtfSWJSZnR1d2xlcVRmSHlhSlJtd1R2YVJwbnIzeVMtaDVxOHZYTi1CWmNUaUotUFRZaWpneWFCX0h5OVpuN1lB</guid></item><item><title>当您停止服用像Ozempic这样的药物时，体重就会恢复，研究结果- ScienceAlert | Weight Comes Back When You Stop Taking Drugs Like Ozempic, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNMFlHRmxqTUJFUWRrZEU3UHNTeDRHNTE0VlJaNV9fUGdBZnNtS3lRbVdVTDRFQXh5dTktYm5qdVVHS2N0STJIX3pRZWtNeDlKcEJ1VmJvRHZRNkhQcW5RRDVRNGgwVEJxS3N1TjA4NmpCTkFCNXlwa0dKZ2FRallIemliMHVYYzJsMUhSWlRmSnlpdVdHd1RuQzJBNDRvWXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We've got fresh evidence for how weight can quickly be regained after weight-loss programs stop – but rather than looking at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bacteria-inside-you-may-explain-why-weight-piles-on-after-dieting"&gt;traditional dieting&lt;/a&gt;, here the researchers wanted to focus on anti-obesity medications (AOMs), as they continue to be used ever more widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from Peking University in China reviewed 11 previous studies involving a total of 2,466 people. The studies covered a variety of AOMs, including those known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLP-1_receptor_agonist"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists&lt;/a&gt; (GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy), which impersonate the natural hormone GLP-1 to control appetite and blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that AOMs were effective at helping people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-3-signs-you-might-be-losing-weight-too-quickly"&gt;to lose weight&lt;/a&gt;. However, they all had something else in common: the weight tended to come back once the course of drugs was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-like-drugs-could-treat-chronic-migraines-trial-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Ozempic-Like Drugs Could Treat Chronic Migraines, Trial Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Significant weight regain occurred eight weeks after discontinuation of AOMs and was sustained through 20 weeks," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-025-04200-0"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; the research team, led by first author Han Wu. "Different weight regain was observed in subjects with different characteristics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169031" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WeightLoss.jpg" alt="Weight gain" class="wp-image-169031 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WeightLoss.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WeightLoss-488x415.jpg 488w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WeightLoss-600x510.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169031" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Weight regain tended to rise and then plateau, while BMI followed a different course. (Wu et al., &lt;em&gt;BMC Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the different types of weight loss treatments covered, it was those &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-supplements-dietitian-reveals-truth-about-glp-1-imitations"&gt;in the GLP-1 category&lt;/a&gt; that showed the most weight gain after treatment had stopped, driving the rest of the results – though they did account for most of the studies analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 20 weeks after stopping their drugs, the participants in the studies had put back on an average of 2.5 kilograms (5.5 pounds). The team also found that people who &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-weight-loss-paradox-shedding-significant-pounds-can-be-deadly-for-some"&gt;lost more weight&lt;/a&gt; tended to regain more afterwards too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help isolate the effects of stopping the medicines, the researchers accounted for several other factors that can also influence weight loss, including levels of exercise and whether or not the individuals concerned &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-distinct-new-form-of-diabetes-has-been-officially-recognized"&gt;had diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why this is happening isn't clear. Future studies might be able to look at the underlying reasons more closely, but there's the possibility that weight loss somehow &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fat-cells-seem-to-cling-to-the-memory-of-being-obese-study-finds"&gt;rewires the body&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of ways that then make it harder to keep to a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The effects of weight cycling on health and systemic metabolism are not thoroughly defined," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-025-04200-0"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the previous studies looked at in the new analysis was &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-gain-common-after-stopping-new-obesity-drugs-study-shows"&gt;published in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, and found that when weekly injections of tirzepatide (or Zepbound) were stopped and participants were switched to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="169028" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;, an average of half the lost weight came back again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth pointing out that this isn't just a problem with weight-loss drugs. It's something that's also been seen in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-reveal-7-key-tips-to-avoid-weight-regain-after-you-diet"&gt;other approaches to staying slim&lt;/a&gt;, including gastric bypasses and vertical banded gastroplasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's another consideration to bear in mind when weighing up AOMs that produce impressive results – there may be a cost to pay later. Questions have already been asked about some of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-type-drugs-may-trigger-brain-changes-linked-to-depression"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-weight-loss-drugs-under-scrutiny-amid-pancreas-concerns"&gt;health risks&lt;/a&gt; that may come with AOMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the researchers are keen to see new studies carried out, covering bigger sample groups over longer periods of time. It's possible that we can find better ways of supporting people once they come off AOMs – or find &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-a-drug-free-way-to-mimic-the-effects-of-ozempic"&gt;healthier alternatives to them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Studies with longer follow-up duration are required to further investigate the potential factors associated with weight change after discontinuation of treatment," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-025-04200-0"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-025-04200-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Researchers criticised “aggressive mandates and the zealotry &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/07/15/fury-german-health-minister-pushes-fourth-covid-vaccine-everyone/"&gt;to vaccinate everyone&lt;/a&gt; at all cost”, adding that the findings had implications for how future vaccine rollouts were handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Ioannidis, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and the study’s first author, said: “I think early estimates were based on many parameters having values that are incompatible with our current understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In principle, targeting the populations who would get the vast majority of the benefit and letting alone those with questionable risk-benefit and cost-benefit makes a lot of sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aggressive mandates and the zealotry &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/01/the-true-tragedy-of-the-covid-19-vaccines/"&gt;to vaccinate&lt;/a&gt; everyone at all cost were probably a bad idea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘Overly optimistic vaccine effectiveness’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 13 billion Covid vaccine doses have been administered since 2021. But there have been mounting concerns that vaccines &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/17/covid-vaccine-harms-cost-government-17bn-inquiry/"&gt;could be harmful&lt;/a&gt; for some people, particularly the young, and that the risk was not worth the benefit for a population at little risk from Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 17,500 Britons have applied to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/14/vaccine-injury-scheme-taxpayers-paid-out-victims/"&gt;the Government’s vaccine damage payment scheme&lt;/a&gt;, believing they or loved ones were injured by the jabs. In June, manufacturers added warnings for myocarditis and pericarditis to the prescribing information of Covid messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new study, the experts used worldwide population data alongside vaccine effectiveness and infection fatality rates to estimate how many people died from a Covid infection before or after the periods of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team believes earlier modelling may have used overly pessimistic infection fatality rates and overly optimistic vaccine effectiveness, while failing to consider how quickly protection waned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies may also have underestimated how many people had already been unknowingly infected by the time they had the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Benefit ‘mostly limited’ to older people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Angelo Maria Pezzullo, a researcher in general and applied hygiene at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, said: “Before ours, several studies tried to estimate lives saved by vaccines with different models and in different periods or parts of the world, but this one is the most comprehensive because it is based on worldwide data. It also covers &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/15/covid-face-masks-did-not-stop-spread-omicron/"&gt;the omicron period&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also calculates the number of years of life that was saved, and it is based on fewer assumptions about the pandemic trend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team calculated that around 14.8 million life-years were saved, one life-year per 900 vaccine doses administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers concluded that although vaccines had a “substantial benefit” on global mortality, it was “mostly limited” to older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The over-70s made up nearly 70 per cent of the lives saved, while those aged 60 to 70 accounted for a further 20 per cent. In contrast, under-20s made up just 0.01 per cent of lives saved, and 20 to 30s were 0.07 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘Reasons for concerns are validated’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Stefania Boccia, of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, added: “These estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations that focused mainly on the first year of vaccination, but clearly demonstrate an important overall benefit from Covid-19 vaccination over the period 2020-2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of the benefits, in terms of lives and life-years saved, have been secured for a portion of the global population who is typically more fragile – the elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir David Davis, the former Brexit secretary who fought against &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/uk-news-update-cases-deaths-vaccine-test-today-rules/"&gt;vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;, said: “Frankly it’s a good cautionary tale that if we have another pandemic we should be far more clinical about the risk-benefit ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew pretty quickly who the most susceptible groups were and we should have focused very strictly on them, rather than placing people who were at little risk &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/06/04/covid-vaccines-may-have-helped-fuel-rise-in-excess-deaths/"&gt;in hazard’s way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The level of aggression of trying to force people to become vaccinated and shutting down people who were raising concerns, the reasons for those concerns are all validated in this report.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research was published in Jama Health Forum.&lt;/p&gt;

Lloyd Huck Chair Professor in Nanomedicine at Penn State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's prototype device can detect HMGB1 - a protein involved in endometriosis development and progression - in period blood with 500 percent more accuracy and confirm whether a person is suffering from the condition, he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To conduct the test, a sample of blood  needs to be added to what looks like a Covid testing strip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If any HMGB1 proteins are present, they bind to the antibodies in the blood and when tested, turn two stripes dark - giving a positive result for endometriosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In case of a negative result, only one stripe on the test darkens.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pan told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/endometriosis-home-test-diagnosis-period-blood-2102953"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;: 'Currently, the only definitive [diagnostic] method is laparoscopic surgery [keyhole surgery, often invasive]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While menstrual blood is not yet a standard diagnostic tool for endometriosis, it's an active area of research with the potential to revolutionize how the condition is diagnosed and monitored in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For a positive test result for endometriosis, two stripes dark on the test (left) and  in case of a negative result, only one stripe on the test darkens (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With our technology, we are hoping to democratize women's health by providing a much-needed tool to track the onset or progression of this disease at the convenience and privacy of home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We anticipate that combining this technology with clinical symptoms will allow for early detection or diagnosis of endometriosis in adolescents and women.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, he also noted that the new test can help reduce the costs and time involved in scheduling and conducting a laparoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'A recent study found that the average cost for a woman with endometriosis was around $30,000 per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This huge financial burden can be reduced [as well as the shame and isolation from stigma] if an accurate at-home test becomes available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our technology once developed, can reduce the time of diagnosis dramatically from years to minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Technologies are being developed that claim to be 'at-home' tests for endometriosis, but in fact they are developing ways to collect samples for laboratories to test.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pan also noted that with further testing and funding, he and his team intend to make the test accessible to people of all incomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, he also hopes to integrate the tests into period pads, making it possible to discreetly and conveniently monitor HMGB1 levels this way at home too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It is our goal to [eventually] provide the kits directly to the public, at a reasonable price point, so women can do the test at home and share the results with their doctors, who will offer diagnoses and advice about next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are looking at a couple of years of effort at this point. The team is actively looking for funding and partners to further develop the test. With funding, this timeline can be reduced in my opinion.

Lloyd Huck Chair Professor in Nanomedicine at Penn State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's prototype device can detect HMGB1 - a protein involved in endometriosis development and progression - in period blood with 500 percent more accuracy and confirm whether a person is suffering from the condition, he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To conduct the test, a sample of blood  needs to be added to what looks like a Covid testing strip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If any HMGB1 proteins are present, they bind to the antibodies in the blood and when tested, turn two stripes dark - giving a positive result for endometriosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In case of a negative result, only one stripe on the test darkens.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pan told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/endometriosis-home-test-diagnosis-period-blood-2102953"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;: 'Currently, the only definitive [diagnostic] method is laparoscopic surgery [keyhole surgery, often invasive]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While menstrual blood is not yet a standard diagnostic tool for endometriosis, it's an active area of research with the potential to revolutionize how the condition is diagnosed and monitored in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For a positive test result for endometriosis, two stripes dark on the test (left) and  in case of a negative result, only one stripe on the test darkens (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With our technology, we are hoping to democratize women's health by providing a much-needed tool to track the onset or progression of this disease at the convenience and privacy of home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We anticipate that combining this technology with clinical symptoms will allow for early detection or diagnosis of endometriosis in adolescents and women.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, he also noted that the new test can help reduce the costs and time involved in scheduling and conducting a laparoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'A recent study found that the average cost for a woman with endometriosis was around $30,000 per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This huge financial burden can be reduced [as well as the shame and isolation from stigma] if an accurate at-home test becomes available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our technology once developed, can reduce the time of diagnosis dramatically from years to minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Technologies are being developed that claim to be 'at-home' tests for endometriosis, but in fact they are developing ways to collect samples for laboratories to test.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pan also noted that with further testing and funding, he and his team intend to make the test accessible to people of all incomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, he also hopes to integrate the tests into period pads, making it possible to discreetly and conveniently monitor HMGB1 levels this way at home too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It is our goal to [eventually] provide the kits directly to the public, at a reasonable price point, so women can do the test at home and share the results with their doctors, who will offer diagnoses and advice about next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are looking at a couple of years of effort at this point. The team is actively looking for funding and partners to further develop the test. With funding, this timeline can be reduced in my opinion. '&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

AIDS agency, has said the drug “could change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic” if it is made available to everyone who needs it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d821ba" class="body-graf"&gt;In June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/hiv-prevention-shot-lenacapavir-gilead-80fb37e2c5ac9b452488d7b86a10d568"&gt;authorized&lt;/a&gt; lenacapavir to prevent HIV. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization recommended countries offer the drug as an additional option to people at risk of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25ac69" class="body-graf"&gt;Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly. Other medication aimed at preventing HIV include daily pills that people can take and another injectable drug called cabotegravir, which is given every two months. Lenacapavir’s six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more visits to health clinics or stigma from taking daily pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-172b16" class="body-graf"&gt;Critics have raised concerns, however, that lenacapavir may not be made widely enough available to stop global outbreaks of HIV.

Interestingly, individuals with this disorder who had fewer heavy drinking days in the past two weeks tended to have higher concentrations of glutathione in this brain region. The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2025.112705"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drug and Alcohol Dependence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorder is a medical condition characterized by an inability to control or stop drinking alcohol despite negative consequences. It involves both physical dependence and psychological compulsion to consume alcohol. Symptoms include tolerance, withdrawal symptoms when the person stops drinking, and continued use despite harm to health or relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic alcohol use affects the brain’s structure and function. It can shrink brain volume, especially in areas like the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which are important for decision-making, memory, and self-control. Chronic heavy drinking also disrupts neurotransmitter systems, including GABA, glutamate, and dopamine, altering mood, behavior, and cognition. Long-term alcohol use can damage white matter in the brain, slowing down communication between brain regions. It may also reduce the brain’s ability to produce and regulate certain antioxidants, increasing vulnerability to oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with alcohol use disorder tend to have problems with attention, impulse control, and emotional regulation. Some brain changes can improve with abstinence, but others may be long-lasting or permanent, depending on severity and duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author James J. Prisciandaro and his colleagues wanted to compare concentrations of glutathione in the brains of individuals with alcohol use disorder and those of light drinkers. Glutathione is the brain’s primary antioxidant. When chronic heavy drinking increases oxidative stress in the brain, the brain increases the production of glutathione to try to compensate for this change and reduce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress is an imbalance between harmful free radicals and the body’s ability to neutralize them with antioxidants (like glutathione). With continued heavy drinking, the body’s capacity to counter oxidative stress through increased production of antioxidants is eventually overwhelmed, resulting in diminished levels of antioxidants and cell and tissue damage due to oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from a previous study that included 20 individuals with alcohol use disorder who were not previously treated and 20 light drinkers matched with them on demographic characteristics. These individuals completed a Time-Line Followback daily drinking interview for the previous 14 days, allowing researchers to map their alcohol use patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, they underwent magnetic resonance imaging of their brains. The researchers used the neuroimaging data to estimate glutathione levels in participants’ brains. Most participants were men of European descent in their twenties who had last consumed alcohol within 7 days before undergoing neuroimaging for this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that participants with alcohol use disorder drank much more alcohol than light drinkers. Neuroimaging showed that they had significantly higher concentrations of glutathione in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex region of their brains compared to light drinkers. Interestingly, individuals with alcohol use disorder who had fewer heavy drinking days in the past two weeks tended to have higher concentrations of glutathione in this brain region. This association was not present among light drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings from this preliminary study are consistent with an interpretation of compensatory GSH [glutathione] upregulation [increase in production] in response to moderate oxidative stress in treatment-naïve individuals with AUD [alcohol use disorder], adding unique support to oxidative stress models of alcohol-related cellular damage and highlighting the potential promise of antioxidant treatments for AUD,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the biochemical changes in the brain associated with heavy drinking. However, it should be noted that these data come from a small group of mostly young males. Results on other demographic groups might not be identical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2025.112705"&gt;Brain glutathione levels and associations with recent drinking in treatment-naïve individuals with alcohol use disorder versus light drinkers,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by James J.

On June 18, he felt something bite him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rising high school junior from Slater, Iowa, mentioned it to his mom when he got home from work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He felt something crawl on him,” says Brandy Johnson, who works in transportation for the Ballard Community School District.  “He said he just jumped.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah had a bite on his lower left butt cheek. He went out with his friends that evening and spent the night at a friend's house. When he came home the next morning, he told his mom, "That bite really hurts." She told him to keep an eye on it and to let her know if it got any worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandy Johnson&lt;/p&gt; Noah Johnson on July 4, 2024&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a few days, the bite had tripled in size. Now it was about the size of a silver dollar, and had two black puncture marks. It looked like a pig's snout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was very very painful," Brandy says. "He couldn’t even sit down on his bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 23, she took him to urgent care. Doctors suspected it was a spider bite that got infected. They didn't know what kind but could see the “fang bites.” They assured his family that no spiders in the state of Iowa could kill someone, but that bites could become infected quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After closer observation, they prescribed antibiotics, but they also tested him for MRSA, a type of staph bacteria that is often resistant to antibiotics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandy Johnson&lt;/p&gt; Noah Johnson shortly before he was bit by a spider&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the infection worsened, and soon he was oozing from not just the spider bite, but two other areas of his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandy knew he needed to go to the emergency room. They gave him more antibiotics and, even though he had a 103-degree fever, he was sent home. Brandy was told to wait at least 48 hours before bringing him back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days later, his fever remained high, and he could no longer walk. They went to &lt;a href="https://www.mgmc.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mary Greeley Medical Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mary Greeley Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; in Ames, Iowa, where he was rushed into emergency surgery to cut out the three infected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, he went into kidney failure. He was immediately transferred to &lt;a href="https://www.unitypoint.org/locations/unitypoint-health---blank-childrens-hospital" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Blank Children’s Hospital;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Blank Children’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Des Moines, where he spent more than two weeks in the Pediatric ICU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every day they thought he might get a little better, he went back downhill," his aunt, Chastity Schonhorst, a finance coordinator for a non-profit, says. "It was heartbreaking."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandy Johnson&lt;/p&gt; Noah Johnson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teen was placed on dialysis. Doctors biopsied his kidneys, and determined that he had a severe allergic reaction to the pain medication he was given at the first hospital. They hoped his kidneys would begin to recover on their own. A colonoscopy showed a small infection in his intestines. "He fought that for weeks," his aunt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah is a strong teen who played baseball for years, according to his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s a great kid,” his mother says. Before the spider bite, he was lifting weights for three hours a day, every day, Brandy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the hospital, he lost 35 lbs. and was bedridden. At certain points, he couldn't even speak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandy Johnson&lt;/p&gt; Noah Johnson in the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 16, he finally felt strong enough to talk to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He thought he was dying. He said, ‘I’m very scared,’” she recalls. “I told him, ‘There’s nothing to be scared of. You’re going to be okay.'”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandy asked hospital staff to please only say positive things in front of her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We needed to keep his mind positive to keep fighting,” adds Chastity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, Brandy walked outside after spending days at her son's bedside in his hospital room. The sunshine was uplifting, and she thought to herself, "I need to get him outside because it feels so good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She convinced the staff to wheel him out to sit in the sun. "He's an outdoors person," she says. The day after he went outside, his vital signs started to improve. He even told his cousin he would like to go fishing with her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandy Johnson&lt;/p&gt; Noah Johnson's mom Brandy took him outside of the hospital to get fresh air and sunshine.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a sign of good things to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah was moved out of the ICU in mid-July after his kidneys started functioning and he was able to stop dialysis. "We needed some good news," his aunt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His friends visited him in the hospital every other day. “They stood by him, and it changed him,” Schonhorst says. “We could see a difference in him just having his friends there.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of Noah’s friends' mothers started a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-noah-johnson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; to help the Johnsons and to get the community involved in praying for him and the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 21, Brandy and Chastity got the great news that Noah was able to go home. "He’s doing much better, but will need weeks of physical therapy, medications and many doctor's visits," his mom says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although it willl take time to regain his strength, Chastity says, "We are so grateful." They hope he will be able to go back to school in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Brandy has been reflecting on the terrifying experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We live in a world that never slows down," she says. "When someone you love — especially your child — suddenly becomes gravely ill, everything changes in an instant. The world you knew just a moment ago disappears."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explains further: "The stress over bills, work, or what you were planning for dinner suddenly seems so small. You find yourself holding your breath, watching machines beep, praying for signs of strength in a little body that should never have to fight this kind of battle."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah's ordeal has given her a new perspective. "We spend so much of our lives believing we need more, but when you’re staring at the possibility of losing someone, you realize you already had everything that mattered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/spider-bite-leaves-iowa-teen-fighting-for-his-life-11775715" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:38:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFB2c3RoRml0MmI0cW1zT0NTWUtReEJqVlJsYjFqamxndkNONjBNUG5NUzZFTWQ5ODFtY25hNE9xbEsteEg2MGF6WmZ2dTlkcEZaUV85TWJzamZLVklJUEtkbXFOaXNnd0l4anM3cHM1SVE</guid></item><item><title>强烈的悲伤会使您的死亡风险增加近90 ％ -神经科学新闻 | Intense Grief Can Raise Your Risk of Death by Nearly 90% - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE1SX2FfRUhvNWYxUUg0UkJlaWJLdlhsa0dFYThjWlZVMFVYVm4takJlcmN4VFpsMi1HQ0NjT3hqOFZERnRteExNNV9jdkFJYlBkaUdTLXdUTUhFVnA0amxlcDIxa29rWTlRa0ln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;While grief is a natural part of loss, some people experience persistently high levels that can have long-term health consequences. A decade-long study in Denmark found that individuals with intense, prolonged grief symptoms had significantly higher rates of healthcare use and were nearly twice as likely to die within 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These individuals were more likely to receive mental health treatment and medications, including antidepressants and sedatives. Early signs, such as pre-existing mental health conditions and medication use, could help clinicians identify those at greatest risk for tailored support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevated Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; People with persistent high grief symptoms had an 88% higher risk of dying within 10 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare Burden:&lt;/strong&gt; This group had significantly higher odds of using mental health services and being prescribed psychotropic medications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Indicators:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-loss use of medications and mental health history may predict vulnerability to long-term grief complications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Frontiers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grief after the loss of a loved one is a natural response – an inevitable part of living and loving. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a minority of the bereaved, grief is so overwhelming that it can lead to physical and mental illnes, even if they don’t necessarily qualify for a diagnosis with the mental health condition ‘prolonged grief disorder’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, studies have shown that people who recently lost a loved one use healthcare services more often, and have an increased mortality rate, over the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers from Denmark have shown that bereaved people with persistent high levels of intense grief used more healthcare services and were more likely to die within 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Public Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first study to investigate the long-term use of healthcare and patterns of mortality over a decade after bereavement in a large-scale cohort,” said Dr Mette Kjærgaard Nielsen, a postdoctoral researcher at the Research Unit for General Practice in Aarhus, Denmark, and the study’s corresponding author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2012, Nielsen and colleagues followed a cohort of 1,735 bereaved women and men living in Denmark with a mean age of 62 years on enrollment. Among them, 66% had recently lost their partner, 27% a parent, and 7% another kind of loved relation. Through the national register of drug prescriptions, the researchers knew which patients had recently been prescribed treatment for a terminal condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were thus able to contact those dying patients to invite them and their loved ones to participate in the study. The protocol had been approved by the Health Research Ethics of the Central Denmark Region and the Danish Data Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Grief trajectories’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, Nielsen &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;had identified five common ‘trajectories’ among this cohort, based on changes in the intensity of grief symptoms over the first three years after losing a loved one. They measured this with the tried-and-tested ‘Prolonged Grief-13’ (PG-13) questionnaire, which assesses symptoms through 13 questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People on the ‘low’ trajectory (38%) displayed persistently low levels of grief symptoms, while 6% followed a ‘high’ trajectory with persistently elevated levels. Three other categories lay between these extremes: 18% and 29% followed a ‘high but decreasing’ and a ‘moderate but decreasing’ trajectory, respectively, and 9% a ‘late onset’ trajectory with a peak of symptoms around six month after bereavement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present study, the researchers extended their follow-up of the participants for a total of 10 years until 2022, except for those who died or emigrated earlier. To do so, Nielsen &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; used data from the Danish National Health Service Register to assess how often each participant received ‘talk therapy’ from a GP or specialist, or were prescribed any psychotropic medication. Records from the Danish Registry of Causes of Deaths gave information on deaths from any cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that for participants on the ‘high’ trajectory, the hazard rate (ie, instantaneous event rate) of dying within 10 years was 88% higher than for participants on a ‘low’ trajectory. They also showed that participants on the ‘high’ trajectory were most likely to receive additional health care services beyond three years after bereavement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, these had 186% higher odds of receiving talk therapy or other mental health services, 463% higher odds of being prescribed antidepressants, and 160% higher odds of being prescribed sedatives or anxiety drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catching the warning signs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences in the frequency of use of these healthcare services between the five trajectories were no longer significant after the first eight years, but the excess mortality of participants on the ‘high’ trajectory remained pronounced over the full 10 years of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What might be the physiological cause of the excess mortality? The researchers aren’t sure yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have previously found a connection between high grief symptom levels and higher rates of cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, and even suicide. But the association with mortality should be further investigated,” said Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors point out that people at risk for a ‘high’ grief trajectory may be recognizable for intervention early, since the data showed that these patients were prescribed psychotropic medication more often even before their loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ‘high grief’ group had lower education on average, and their more frequent use of medication before bereavement suggested that they had signs of mental vulnerability, which may cause greater distress on bereavement,” said Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A GP could look for previous signs of depression and other severe mental health conditions. They can then offer these patients tailored follow-up in general practice, or refer them to a private-practice psychologist or secondary care. The GP may also suggest a bereavement follow-up appointment focusing on mental health,” suggested Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this grief and mortality research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3f4f4d5a4c4c7f594d50514b565a4d4c565111504d58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mischa Dijkstra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://frontiersin.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mischa Dijkstra – Frontiers&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1619730/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Grief trajectories and long-term health effects in bereaved relatives: a prospective, population-based cohort study with 10-year follow-up&lt;/a&gt;” by Mette Kjærgaard Nielsen et al. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grief trajectories and long-term health effects in bereaved relatives: a prospective, population-based cohort study with 10-year follow-up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bereavement may affect the health of relatives, causing increased use of health care services and increased mortality shortly after the patient’s death. However, the long-term consequences for those with a high level of grief symptoms remain largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to investigate associations between grief symptom trajectories and four long-term health outcomes among relatives bereaved by natural death: contacts to general practice and mental health services, use of psychotropic prescription medication, and mortality, over a period of three to ten years post-bereavement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed grief symptoms using the Prolonged Grief-13 scale in a cohort of 1,735 bereaved relatives at three different time points (prior to bereavement, six months after bereavement, and three years after bereavement) and identified five main grief trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trajectory with persistent low levels of grief symptoms in relatives (n=670 (45%)) was called the low grief trajectory (LGT) and was used as reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high grief trajectory (HGT) consisted of 107 (6%) relatives with persistent high grief symptom levels. We investigated associations between grief trajectories and 1) contacts to general practitioner (GP) including out-of-hours using negative binomial regression analysis, 2) contacts to mental health services (GP talk therapy, private-practice psychologist or psychiatrist), 3) use of psychotropic medications (antidepressants, anxiolytics and sedatives) using logistic regression analysis, and 4) mortality using Cox regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The follow-up period started at three years after bereavement and long-term outcome were further followed until ten years after the patient’s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relatives in the HGT had a significantly higher yearly incidence of GP contacts until seven years after bereavement compared to the LGT. The HGT was associated with higher use of mental health services (OR=2.86 (95%CI 1.58;5.19)), antidepressants (OR=5.63 (95% CI 3.52; 9.01)), sedatives and anxiolytics (OR=2.60 (95%CI 1.63;4.14)), and excess mortality (OR=1.88 (95% CI 1.1;3.2)) compared to the LGT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study shows that patients with high and sustained grief symptoms have an increased healthcare use up to ten years after loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should assess whether current health care services sufficiently meet the prolonged needs of these relatives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:37:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE1SX2FfRUhvNWYxUUg0UkJlaWJLdlhsa0dFYThjWlZVMFVYVm4takJlcmN4VFpsMi1HQ0NjT3hqOFZERnRteExNNV9jdkFJYlBkaUdTLXdUTUhFVnA0amxlcDIxa29rWTlRa0ln</guid></item><item><title>CRISPR可以通过编辑蚊子中的单个基因来阻止疟疾传播- Engadget | CRISPR can stop malaria spread by editing a single gene in mosquitos - Engadget</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxPZ1F2b0JZcDhoZWFyZlRaQ2JkQndWQVpkOWZnRGxPbU1sSlV0MzBFbDNTYk8tSWhlSmxyU1BmV0tRVUppaDlUT3VGUzZ6YlVTdW5fWVpZamRCQWNQd05XdkFEajRwd25IVUVyZnZJT1RRajdWeWtNOUJBT0VRTnYyZll0MktDS0FucjNHNW1nQ21KSnYzekhwS2N5TUVsVGozeWdnVHUxeVUyYm5RX0lXc2V5Q0x0ZGs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRISPR gene-editing therapy has shown &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2023-was-a-big-year-for-crispr-based-gene-editing-but-challenges-remain-160009074.html" data-ylk="slk:great potential;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;great potential&lt;/a&gt; to treat and even cure diseases, but scientists are now discovering how it can be used to prevent them as well.

These genetically modified mosquitos could eventually be released into the wild, helping prevent some of the 600,000 malaria deaths that occur each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquitos infect up to 263 million people yearly with malaria and efforts to reduce their populations have stalled as late. That's because both the mosquitos and their parasites that spread malaria have developed resistance to insecticides and other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, biologists from UC San Diego, Johns Hopkins and UC Berkeley universities have figured out a way to stop malarial transmission by changing a single amino acid in mosquitos. The altered mosquitos can still bite people with malaria and pick up parasites from their blood, but those can no longer be spread to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system uses CRISPR-Cas9 "scissors" to cut out an unwanted amino acid (allele) that transmits malaria and replace it with a benign version. The undesirable allele, called L224, helps parasites swim to a mosquito's salivary glands where they can then infect a person. The new amino acid, Q224, blocks two separate parasites from making it to the salivary glands, preventing infection in people or animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With a single, precise tweak, we’ve turned [a mosquito gene component] into a powerful shield that blocks multiple malaria parasite species and likely across diverse mosquito species and populations, paving the way for adaptable, real-world strategies to control this disease," said researcher George Dimopoulos from Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous methods of malarial control, changing that key gene doesn't affect the health or reproduction capabilities of mosquitos. That allowed the researchers to create a technique for mosquito offspring to inherit the Q224 allele and spread it through their populations to stop malarial parasite transmission in its tracks. "We’ve harnessed nature’s own genetic tools to turn mosquitoes into allies against malaria," Dimopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="commerce-disclaimer default wider-padding"&gt;If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Engadget</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:30:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxPZ1F2b0JZcDhoZWFyZlRaQ2JkQndWQVpkOWZnRGxPbU1sSlV0MzBFbDNTYk8tSWhlSmxyU1BmV0tRVUppaDlUT3VGUzZ6YlVTdW5fWVpZamRCQWNQd05XdkFEajRwd25IVUVyZnZJT1RRajdWeWtNOUJBT0VRTnYyZll0MktDS0FucjNHNW1nQ21KSnYzekhwS2N5TUVsVGozeWdnVHUxeVUyYm5RX0lXc2V5Q0x0ZGs</guid></item><item><title>大流行压力可能已经使您的大脑老化-即使没有感染- Earth.com | Pandemic stress may have aged your brain - even without infection - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQYV91QWpBX1BTRGV1LUY0NWJuZ2s1QjB1Nzg5Y051WmRKeXh0Qm1ZY0lQVXRHc3dsWFNUWVI3dEw4VW5qSG9tNDcwM0FRSUJaaXNoNXM1dXB4cWJPLW1oSmRhWE5DV0FteDVYZkZMM0JtVFlKNW9YMXJWNkt2bkNzcnZYWlh0dHdFZnd6OTlZRUtFT0xiV1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists watched the pandemic reshape hospitals, jobs, and politics, but a new set of brain scans hints that it also reshaped the organ inside our skulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were never infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed brains that looked a few months older than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that merely living through lockdowns, uncertainty, and social upheaval left a subtle neurological signature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings come from a new investigation by Dr. Ali-Reza Mohammadi-Nejad of the &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nottingham’s School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pandemic-stress-aged-the-brain"&gt;Pandemic stress aged the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 1,000 healthy adults enrolled in the UK Biobank underwent two MRI sessions – one before March 2020. For half of them, a second scan took place between 2021 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used machine learning models built from 15,334 pre-pandemic scans to estimate each volunteer’s brain age gap, the difference between predicted brain age and chronological age. A positive gap means the brain appears older on imaging, a negative gap younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What surprised me most was that even people who hadn’t had Covid showed significant increases in brain aging rates,” said Mohammadi-Nejad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who weren’t infected but lived through the pandemic showed an average increase in brain age of about five and a half months compared to similar individuals who were scanned twice before 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older age, male sex, and lower income made the acceleration steeper, demonstrating that biology and biography travel together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stress-accelerates-brain-aging"&gt;Stress accelerates brain aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study adds to a growing collection of research that links chronic stress hormones to faster structural decline in white matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated allostatic load, the body’s cumulative stress score, correlates with brains that look a year or two older than they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolation compounds the problem. A study of 24,867 adults found &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/loneliness-harms-health-more-than-alcohol-obesity-or-smoking/"&gt;loneliness&lt;/a&gt; and poverty were linked to higher brain age and worse physical health. Lockdowns amplified both stress and isolation, so a slight pandemic era uptick in brain age is biologically plausible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies support the idea. Rodents under constant stress show brain inflammation and damage in areas used to estimate brain age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-infected-brains-show-more-decline"&gt;Infected brains show more decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 infection had its own costs. Participants who caught the virus took longer on the Trail Making Test (TMT), a timed task of mental flexibility, than both controls and pandemic peers who were never infected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate Japanese cohort &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7563673/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; confirms that slower trail making times flag early cognitive change in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans of infected people elsewhere echo the pattern. A 2022 report comparing 401 infected volunteers with 384 controls found greater gray matter loss in orbitofrontal and parahippocampal regions, areas tied to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-your-brain-decides-what-smells-good-or-bad/"&gt;smell&lt;/a&gt; and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Nottingham analysis, only the infected subgroup linked larger brain age jumps with worse trail making scores, hinting that viral effects and stress effects overlap but are not identical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stress-hits-the-vulnerable-harder"&gt;Stress hits the vulnerable harder&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living in a disadvantaged neighborhood, working an unstable job, or lacking higher education magnified the brain aging-signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employment insecurity, for example, added almost six extra months to the gap compared with securely employed peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These scans make visible a truth social scientists have charted for decades: financial strain and limited social capital seep into physiology. When economic cushions thinned during &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/covid-19-lockdowns-weakened-our-immune-systems/"&gt;lockdowns&lt;/a&gt;, the impact may have sped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data support protecting vulnerable groups during crises, as stress leaves measurable effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-healing-depends-on-lifestyle"&gt;Healing depends on lifestyle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t yet test whether the changes we saw will reverse, but it’s certainly possible, and that’s an encouraging thought,” said Professor Dorothee Auer, senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain age models capture averages, not destinies. Earlier studies of stress recovery suggest that gray matter volume and brain connectivity can rebound when stress is reduced. Recovery is more likely when lifestyle factors like sleep, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/small-bursts-of-intense-exercise-can-slow-brain-aging/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and social contact improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer follow-ups will reveal whether the pandemic’s neural footprint fades, stays put, or predicts later cognitive trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the scans remind us that global emergencies do not end at the ICU door – they echo inside healthy brains, too, in ways only careful imaging can catch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-scans-reveal-policy-impact"&gt;Brain scans reveal policy impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study adds weight to the idea that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-brains-age-might-be-older-than-you-are/"&gt;brain age&lt;/a&gt; could become a routine marker in population health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If small changes in daily life – or major global events – show up clearly on brain scans, public health leaders might one day use brain age metrics to evaluate policy impacts over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also raises the question of how resilience works at a neural level. Some people weathered the pandemic with little psychological or neurological wear, while others showed sharper declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding what protects brain health under chronic stress could shape future treatments or community interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61033-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:11:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQYV91QWpBX1BTRGV1LUY0NWJuZ2s1QjB1Nzg5Y051WmRKeXh0Qm1ZY0lQVXRHc3dsWFNUWVI3dEw4VW5qSG9tNDcwM0FRSUJaaXNoNXM1dXB4cWJPLW1oSmRhWE5DV0FteDVYZkZMM0JtVFlKNW9YMXJWNkt2bkNzcnZYWlh0dHdFZnd6OTlZRUtFT0xiV1E</guid></item><item><title>当您每天喝咖啡时，血糖会发生什么变化？ - Verywell Health | What Happens to Your Blood Sugar When You Drink Coffee Every Day? - Verywell Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFBaSFR4bUpneHp6ZWd0Rm9RLWNDQVN6MENJMDJ1alJvcjl6MTZwa0daeFo5N3JCaFhuVWxHOXJEdGp6YzlCZ3pmOTBjVG5keEZNdy1kWk1CZFJqeF9QX25sdXdzZXpvME0wQ3ZsTFYzS3JfMHRsdXUtRw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee may cause blood sugar to spike or fall. The effects depend on your metabolism, whether you drink it with food, and how much caffeine you consume.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It can. But it depends on the dose, your individual biology, and how and when you drink it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking coffee may lead to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/causes-blood-sugar-rise-in-non-diabetics-5120349" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;short-term spikes in blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and changes in insulin response, especially in people with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/insulin-resistance-8421034" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-does-caffeine-do-to-your-body-11717701" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Caffeine&lt;/a&gt; is likely the reason for this effect. It stimulates the release of stress hormones like adrenaline, which can interfere with insulin production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It also signals the liver to release stored glucose, making it harder for cells to absorb this excess glucose from the bloodstream.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Take note of whether you typically drink your coffee on an empty or full stomach. “Caffeine absorption rates are faster on an empty stomach,” said &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/candace-pumper" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Candace Pumper, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She added that rapid absorption can lead to more pronounced blood sugar spikes, especially if coffee is also loaded with added sugar or sweetened creamers. However, these effects are usually short-lived.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The long-term observational cohort studies generally show a strong inverse association between &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/is-coffee-good-for-you-11738884" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher coffee intake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/type-2-diabetes-causes-risk-factors-1087693" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;,"&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said &lt;a href="https://publichealth.uci.edu/faculty/odegaard-andrew/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Andrew Odegaard, MPH, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor and expert on diet, nutrition, and type 2 diabetes at UC Irvine Joe C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In other words, drinking more coffee tends to correlate with a lower risk for type 2 diabetes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This may be because coffee contains other compounds with &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-with-more-antioxidants-than-blueberries-11738539" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; and anti-inflammatory properties that may counterbalance caffeine’s downsides over time.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re concerned about your glucose response but don’t want to give up your brew, there are science-backed ways to sip smarter, according to Pumper and Odegaard:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink coffee with or after food&lt;/strong&gt;: Pair your brew with a meal or snack to slow caffeine absorption and blunt &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/blood-sugar-spikes-5216913" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar spikes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose unsweetened or naturally sweetened options:&lt;/strong&gt; Use &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/sugar-replacements-for-diabetics-1087191" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;natural sugar substitutes&lt;/a&gt; like stevia, &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/monk-fruit-11734221" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;monk fruit&lt;/a&gt;, or allulose instead of sugar or flavored syrups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go half-caf or decaf:&lt;/strong&gt; Cut back on the caffeine content if you’re especially sensitive to it or already have insulin resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try coffee alternatives&lt;/strong&gt;: Black or green tea, dandelion root coffee, or even low-acid coffee may be gentler on blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track your response: &lt;/strong&gt;Pay attention to how you feel when drinking coffee. If you wear a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/continuous-glucose-monitoring-the-arrival-of-dexcom-5-3289566" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt;, you can also track how different types and timings of coffee affect you. Stick with whatever timing leaves you feeling at your best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

ROACH: I am a 74-year-old man. I have a DEXA score of -3.3. I take 1,200 mg of calcium with vitamin D daily. I lift weights and swim two to three times a week. My doctor put me on Prolia, and I had six months of infections. He switched me to Fosamax, and my blood pressure was 201/121 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="E4YNBW75YREEJH56TI7ZC54EQI"&gt;I found a Phase 4 clinical trial showing that Fosamax can cause high blood pressure, but my doctor says that Fosamax “doesn’t cause high blood pressure.” I’m reluctant to try the other bisphosphonates for fear that they will do the same as Fosamax. Do I try the other drugs one at a time, or do you have a recommendation? -- D.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LHBWZVETVBEFLHGAXX4ALKG7NQ"&gt;ANSWER: Your doctor should have said that people taking alendronate (Fosamax) have the same rate of developing high blood pressure as people who are put on a placebo pill, which would have been a more accurate statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YSNOWDJT7JAY3DYXQT553DV5SA"&gt;In the 12 months when subjects in a trial took alendronate, 1.9% developed high blood pressure -- about the same rate seen in a placebo group over the same time period. It’s unlikely that Fosamax caused your high blood pressure levels, but it is certainly possible that you are having a rare reaction, which happens to few enough people that it hasn’t yet been recognized. I hope your physician reported this as a possible adverse event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DSDE2G4NNFAG5M43XFTQDKYPBE"&gt;A T-score of -3.3 by a DEXA represents quite severe osteoporosis. When I see levels this low, I tend not to use denosumab (Prolia) or bisphosphonates, both of which work by preventing the osteoclast cells from reabsorbing bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RBJZ56YOHFDJBETRFORMMCAJT4"&gt;Prolia also has a theoretical risk of increased infections, and it seems that this might have been the case with you. Instead, I would consider a medicine that promotes bone growth, such as teriparatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T2BPXWHDFJHPFJEQO6MY2AWQ4I"&gt;Finally, I test all men with osteoporosis for low testosterone since it is a major risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I currently take several medications and supplements daily that are encapsulated in “dissolvable” plastic capsules. How much concern should I have regarding a large or dangerous buildup of microplastic particles in my body? -- G.H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y4WQ4UVEXZEJLD7IZVLYYHNC74"&gt;ANSWER: Microplastics are tiny amounts of polymers that have been detected in human blood and organs. The primary source is in contaminated food and water, but microplastics can be inhaled as well. Bottled water is probably the single largest source of microplastics, with levels 20 times higher than tap water. Beer is the second most-common source, while air is third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="A33IXK5UQBG6DB7WTXZGI4HAGI"&gt;The material that drug capsules are made from is most often gelatin, a plant protein. Starch, methylcellulose and polysaccharides may also be used. Plastic is almost never used, although I do know of a very few exceptions -- such as Procardia, where the shell of a capsule isn’t intended to be absorbed and is excreted intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VGXWEF4JTNFVBPACXOUL37Z6IA"&gt;You should not worry about your medications as a significant source of microplastics.

"Therefore, 7,000 steps per day might be a more realistic and achievable recommendation for some, but 10,000 steps per day can still be a viable target for those who are more active.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-12" data-node-id="11" class="embed"&gt;&lt;aside class="css-13bgmn2 e94w1mj9"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-1pxsip e94w1mj7"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-13p2wp0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj5"&gt;More On Your Step Count From WH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="where-did-the-10000-number-come-from" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;Where did the 10,000 number come from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The famous steps goal number has a long history behind it (you can do a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598280/accidental-step-count-scam/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598280/accidental-step-count-scam/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="deep dive here" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;deep dive here&lt;/a&gt;). But here's a quick recap: This number was formulated by a Tokyo doctor named Iwao Ohya who created a fitness tracker called Manpo-Kei (in Japanese, that means "10,000 step meter) with engineer Jiro Kato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It's been suggested that 10,000 steps was chosen because the Japanese character for 10,000 looks like a man running or walking, but it’s not really clear if that's truly one of the reasons behind the number. (Both inventors have since died.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The number 10,000 eventually got picked up by researchers and fitness tracker developers, and its popularity spread. These days, almost everyone knows the number. Still, "no clinical data backed it then, and none was added later," says Dani Singer, CPT, founder of &lt;a href="http://www.fit2gopt.com/" target="_blank" data-offer-url="http://www.fit2gopt.com/" data-event-click='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view='{"pattern":"ExternalLink"}' data-include-experiments="true" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-node-id="15.1" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://www.fit2gopt.com/" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fit2Go Personal Training." class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Fit2Go Personal Training.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-not-accurate" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Why is it not accurate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While hitting 10,000 steps isn't bad for you (and means you're moving a lot throughout the day) the exact number is pretty much made up. "It was a marketing campaign,” says Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS, co-founder of &lt;a href="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SoHo Strength Lab" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;SoHo Strength Lab&lt;/a&gt;. “There wasn’t a scientific basis for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Matheny stresses that the 10,000 steps a day goal isn’t necessarily inaccurate from a health POV—but many people can get serious health perks between 5,000 to 7,000 steps a day. "The data show health gains level off well before 10,000," Singer says. "Mortality and cardiovascular risk improvements start at just 2,000. It's important to understand this so that you avoid an all-or-nothing mindset—especially one that isn't based on any actual data."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If that's the number you like, and you hit it consistently, stick with it! But just remember: “10,000 steps per day is not the magic number," per Matheny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-how-many-steps-should-i-take-per-day" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;So, how many steps should I take per day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Based on the scientific review's findings, aiming for 5,000 to 7,000 steps a day is a good goal to reach for. That's roughly two to 3.5 miles per day, depending on your stride. “There’s nothing wrong with 10,000 steps, but it isn’t based in science,” Matheny says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you want to still aim for 10,000 steps, Matheny says you should go for it. “If you don’t get there, maybe you still get to 7,000,” he points out. But any amount of walking is helpful. “A thousand steps is way better than zero,” Matheny says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

As long as someone is eating high-quality proteins from any source, Dr. Erickson says their body will be able to make the collagen it needs on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides focusing on getting enough protein, Hayes and Dr. Erikson both say that vitamin C also plays a role in generating collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin C is part of the collagen matrix and a deficiency could lead to missing one of the key components the body needs to make collagen,” Hayes says, adding that there are many good sources of the nutrient (including citrus foods, tomatoes, and bell peppers) and that the vast majority of people in the US get enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three nutrition experts emphasized that there is no need to take a collagen supplement if someone is meeting their protein needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about all the claims about collagen helping to reduce wrinkles, improve joint health, or anything else you may come across? Hayes, Dr. Erikson, and Dr. Begdachne are all in agreement that upping the amount of protein you’re getting will have the same effects; if you’re getting enough protein, you don’t need to supplement with collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are studies out there showing different benefits of supplementing with collagen, but if you really look at them they are all flawed,” Dr. Erikson says. “They are either funded by a supplement company or they don’t use good control [guidelines]. Often, the placebo in collagen supplement studies is nothing. But the placebo should be another protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line? “There is no study showing that a collagen supplement is more beneficial than a high-quality diet,” Dr. Erikson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Still Want to Get a Collagen Supplement? Here’s What to Keep in Mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re still convinced that you need to stock up on collagen, there are a few tips the experts say to keep in mind. When shopping for collagen supplements or skin-care products, you will likely see the type of collagen referred to as marine or bovine. This, Dr. Begdache says, refers to how it was sourced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Marine collagen comes from fish—the skin and bones are especially good sources—and bovine collagen comes from cows,” Dr. Begdachne says. In general, she says not to get too hung up on marine versus bovine collagen, but she says marine collagen does contain more type 1 collagen, which tends to be smaller and easier to absorb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Type 1 collagen is what’s mostly found in skin, so if you are looking for a collagen product for skin health, marine would be a slightly better choice,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since supplements are not FDA-regulated, Dr. Erikson says that there is a risk of toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Especially supplements sourced from animals, like collagen supplements, there is a risk of heavy metals,” he says. “The cow could have been exposed to lead or other metals in the soil from its food and fish can contain mercury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be safe, he recommends finding a supplement with a US Pharmacopeia (USP) seal, which indicates that it has been third-party tested for ingredient accuracy and is free of contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collagen does play an important role in the body, but as long as you’re getting enough protein and vitamin C, it’s not something you have to worry about. This is one trend you don’t have to buy into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTE1ZYUlOZzdlZlJqdGFGaTNrbmxEX0ZMYmFteEd6Q1ZoMXdyMGRGMjhRVDBQclFndHJKb3ZrdkFQbm5nMExYNVl6UndrNy1BM1Btajg1Uktlb2VVRm80WFlvQWxmWQ</guid></item><item><title>只有一个瓶装水品牌不含微塑料—这项研究证明了这一点- The Daily Galaxy | Only One Bottled Water Brand Is Free of Microplastics — and This Study Proves It - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxPeXRzMjU4NzNmT3JsWWs3cHB6RG1PdDVfXy1YcWhGWm9HQXlFdEpDY2ZSMmZTbXlBNVdUbGRZa3VnbFdrVGJxTVNQWjU4R05FSUJjdTFGSkg4NW9VUmFwSDlRMmxadUhwcDRwUmdwYlZCUzRnVy0yajVKeGRiSzB1OUt0cUNVNEtfZjlhTEZDMXhvamVydFhOZTBEdUlwRDVqWmJYYzhLUFlvX3B3czlfZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, people have started noticing that our surroundings are getting loaded with tiny bits of plastic. A study by researchers from Columbia University and Rutgers University—published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2024—reveals some eye-opening findings about bottled water. This report challenges the idea that bottled water is a safer pick over tap water and makes us wonder about its effects on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unveiling the presence of microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found an average of 240,000 plastic fragments per liter in bottled water. Most of these particles are actually nanoplastics, with 90% measuring less than 1 micrometer; the other 10% fall into the microplastics range, between 5 millimeters and 1 micrometer. Given that such tiny pieces can slip into the bloodstream and possibly settle in organs like the heart and brain, the findings are quite concerning. Wei Min, a Columbia chemistry professor and co-author, noted, “The smaller they are, the easier it is to confuse them with natural cell components.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To nail down these results, the team used advanced techniques like stimulated Raman scattering microscopy paired with artificial intelligence. This method helped them pinpoint and sort seven different types of plastics in bottled water, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Beizhan Yan, a research professor at Columbia, mentioned that if a bottle has lots of PET bits, there tend to be fewer particles from other plastics used in water treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sources and implications of contamination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study points to several origins for the plastic particles in bottled water. PET, a common material for making bottles, came up as a major source. But it wasn’t just the bottle itself—filtration and purification systems also seem to add plastic bits. This means that even thorough cleaning processes might accidentally introduce these small plastic bits into the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, among all the brands tested, only one showed no sign of microplastics or nanoplastics. Although the study didn’t name the brand, it shows that making bottled water free from these tiny plastics is possible if strict filtration and packaging methods are applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings make anyone who drinks bottled water every day rethink their options and wonder about the quality of what they’re consuming. They also point to the need for more studies on plastic contamination from various sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future research directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team behind this groundbreaking work isn’t stopping here. They plan to widen their research to tap water, packaged foods, and even human tissues to see just how widespread plastic particles really are. They’re also set to study how these particles affect development and the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beizhan Yan called this area “a dark, unexplored field,” noting that earlier toxicity tests were mostly guesses about plastic exposure levels. Now, with these new methods, there’s a chance to really understand how deeply microplastics have crept into our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we come to grips with these revelations about microplastics in bottled water, it’s clear that we need to reconsider our choices and push for better standards in how water is filtered and bottled. This study is a wake-up call, urging us all to look closer at what we’re drinking and to start moving toward cleaner alternatives that put our well-being first.&lt;/p&gt;

Health officials in Chicago issued a similar warning a few weeks earlier, as a batch of mosquitoes there had tested positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"With mosquito season underway in Illinois, it is now time for Illinoisans, especially seniors and those with weakened immune systems, to start taking precautions to prevent mosquito bites," said IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra, according to Patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this announcement important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;West Nile can cause &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as fever, headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the virus can also be deadly. Illinois saw 69 human cases in 2024, including 13 deaths, according to the &lt;a href="https://idph.illinois.gov/wnvpublic/wnvglance.aspx?year=2024" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:IDPH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;IDPH&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While West Nile has been in the U.S. since &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007186.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1999;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;, a warming planet is driving increases in mosquito-borne illnesses. These bloodsuckers benefit from warmer and wetter conditions, which are helping them expand their ranges, remain active for longer seasons, and move into higher altitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For instance, a Massachusetts epidemiologist recently called people to alert after the state discovered its first West Nile-carrying mosquitoes two weeks earlier than last year. And Connecticut officials are warning residents that the type of tiger mosquito that carries chikungunya, Zika, and dengue is expected to spread farther and faster than usual across the state in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about mosquito-borne illnesses?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The IDPH is encouraging people to "fight the bite" to best avoid the potential of contracting West Nile. Recommendations include eliminating standing water, using screens on windows or doors or keeping them shut, wearing long clothing and an Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellent when outside, and reporting standing water if it has been present for more than a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many communities are also looking for ways to reduce mosquito populations in their efforts to protect residents. For instance, officials in one Florida county are using X-rays to kill invasive mosquitoes, and one Manila neighborhood is paying residents to bring in any mosquitoes they can capture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/future-newsletter/?rec3K1DcanxmvsGYh" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;good news&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;useful tips&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 11:15:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQTU90RzlTUmlSR2xmaTVLVXR2UVlqOTB0eTZ6SlV6Y3dqekhhZ3lRcjl0aGwzZTk0LWhSclI5MkFRN1dtVVFWbEczaUhrTXpLclJzTW9hZG90QW1abzNyaG9uVWU4RXVBU2xmaGpOcklIejlxcEZtZHpsME9VUlcyWS1DTGtaUUN4X2VQX1JpMEQ</guid></item><item><title>不再需要每天数到10000 -研究表明，健康益处相等，步数更少- Earth.com | No more counting to 10,000 every day - study shows equal health benefits in fewer steps - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNWjVEX2pva0hzSGFrOEJIY2ZfSlJsZmQ1LTNMSE5LTW5wUnhqeEt4dlFzZnlISThvcUQ3MXVESWlJV2VOVTIzZ3l2dEpFVDZuaU9Zald0S3habU1WdG9abGtiS01USmJkVFY5cDJ4N3ZGc0JJb0paWllvNjlYMHZ1cEdlVzlaTDNLZ3JZbHU3TThIVjFZcm5fMlpqYjJaVGJhQndV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fitness tracker doesn’t care whether you run for the bus or wander through the grocery store. It simply counts. Those digital tallies have become a barometer of personal health and wellness, yet the “magic” 10,000-step goal that pops up on so many screens never came from a medical textbook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New evidence now suggests that you can bank most of the same benefits with a target that feels far more doable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily movement is still critical. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cardiorespiratory-fitness-linked-to-greater-cognitive-performance/"&gt;Cardiorespiratory fitness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/squats-vs-walking-the-definitive-winner-for-reducing-blood-sugar/"&gt;blood sugar control&lt;/a&gt;, and mood all improve when people spend less time sitting. The question has always been how much walking is enough to tip the scales toward better health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sweeping review published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Public Health&lt;/em&gt; turns that puzzle on its head, offering a fresh benchmark that’s easier to reach for schoolchildren, office workers, and older adults alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-benefits-of-daily-steps"&gt;Health benefits of daily steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After combing through data collected between 2014 and 2025 in Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and several other nations, researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt; weighed information from fifty-seven studies that tracked step counts with pedometers, accelerometers, and popular wrist-worn sensors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/melody-ding.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Melody Ding&lt;/a&gt; explains, “Aiming for 7,000 steps is a realistic goal based on our findings, which assessed health outcomes in a range of areas that hadn’t been looked at before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis compared people who logged about 2,000 steps per day with peers who reached higher brackets in 1,000-step increments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that moving up to roughly 7,000 steps lowered the risk of dying from any cause by 47 percent, almost matching the advantage seen at 10,000 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-numbers-reveal"&gt;What the numbers reveal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking around 3½ miles a day also trimmed dementia risk by 38 percent, while an extra 3,000 steps beyond that shaved only seven additional percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; showed a different curve: incidence dropped 22 percent at 10,000 steps and 27 percent at 12,000. Importantly, the biggest jump in protection happened when people climbed from 2,000 to between 5,000 and 7,000 steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/katherine.owen.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Katherine Owen&lt;/a&gt;, the study’s chief analyst, notes, “For people who are already active, 10,000 steps a day is great, but beyond 7,000 steps, the extra benefits for most of the health outcomes we looked at were modest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-gains-and-step-goals"&gt;Health gains and step goals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review did more than tally deaths. Researchers linked a 7,000-step habit to lower odds of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-remains-the-leading-cause-of-death-worldwide/"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, certain cancers, depression, and mobility problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know daily step count is linked to living longer, but we now also have evidence that walking at least 7,000 steps a day can significantly improve eight major health outcomes – including reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, and depressive symptoms,” Professor Ding says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings back up earlier work showing that even light-intensity activity improves insulin sensitivity, blood-pressure regulation, and the release of brain-boosting neurochemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-moving-the-goalposts-again"&gt;Moving the goalposts (again)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did 10,000 steps take root in the first place? Historians trace the figure to a Japanese pedometer marketed in the 1960s under the name &lt;em&gt;manpo-kei&lt;/em&gt;, or “10,000-step meter.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketers rounded the idea into a neat slogan, and fitness culture never looked back. Science, however, keeps refining the target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pooling millions of person-years of follow-up, the Sydney team demonstrated that the curve of risk reduction begins to flatten once people cross 7,000 steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitting higher numbers still helps, especially for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-a-cellular-switch-mitochondria-that-could-reverse-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;blood-glucose&lt;/a&gt; control, yet the incremental payoff shrinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-small-increases-big-payoffs"&gt;Small increases, big payoffs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most adults in high-income countries average fewer than 5,000 steps on workdays. That leaves substantial room for improvement without marathon ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Ding reminds readers, “However, for those who cannot yet achieve 7,000 steps a day, even small increases in step counts, such as increasing from 2,000 to 4,000 steps a day, are associated with significant health gains.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same principle holds for those edging toward retirement: replacing a couple of car trips each week with short walks or choosing stairs instead of elevators can push step totals into the protective zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-finding-what-fits"&gt;Finding what fits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health agencies have long advised at least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly, a metric many people find hard to translate into daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steps provide a simpler yardstick, and the Australian government is already exploring how to fold the new evidence into future guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also want to know whether age, chronic illness, or regional differences should tweak the threshold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/to-get-fit-and-stay-healthy-walk-this-exact-distance-every-day/"&gt;Step counters&lt;/a&gt; miss swimming and cycling, and most studies still overrepresent wealthier nations, so widening the research net will sharpen advice for diverse communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-steps-and-the-future"&gt;Health, steps, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main lesson is one of progress rather than perfection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research helps to shift the focus from perfection to progress. Even small increases in daily movement can lead to meaningful health improvements,” Professor Ding concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stroll with the dog, an extra loop around the block during lunch, or pacing the sidelines at a child’s soccer game all add to the tally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross the 7,000-step mark most days, and you are likely protecting your heart, mind, and metabolic health. Go further if you enjoy it, but remember that the steepest gains come early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your sneakers – and your body – will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2468266725001641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Lancet Public Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 11:08:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNWjVEX2pva0hzSGFrOEJIY2ZfSlJsZmQ1LTNMSE5LTW5wUnhqeEt4dlFzZnlISThvcUQ3MXVESWlJV2VOVTIzZ3l2dEpFVDZuaU9Zald0S3habU1WdG9abGtiS01USmJkVFY5cDJ4N3ZGc0JJb0paWllvNjlYMHZ1cEdlVzlaTDNLZ3JZbHU3TThIVjFZcm5fMlpqYjJaVGJhQndV</guid></item><item><title>这8个常见习惯可能会增加您患痴呆症的风险- HuffPost | These 8 Common Habits Could Increase Your Risk Of Dementia - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOV1hlQzlKUnNTeHNzc0RnV2RhMU5ON1NXdUdkS2lvekV2UHpITGEtSi1SOWFTUkplVlFrN2lqdVI4WFZQdXpvS2VBZHNzemRtZjRSUjZpaXUxcW9fNmJ5TXF5QXdvdDNabnNXMFUxM28zd0ktc0xYUnZhUU1vdllvaDB5c3REOWlDelFnM2JMMzXSAZYBQVVfeXFMT0hWejhCQWE5cGhGdlBVc0paWE00aUFQUjZEMTdBaTVzaDJicTlOWUxyU09zWWt6bEZKX3ZkMkEwb09SMVB4MlE5N1BuNWxGN0ZXU3huRTFZRi1GNDFGYUstWkRpUkNhakJKV21sWkJPSmNEUkF2RFlDbV9mSXBqbzVySWlfZGN5QTdSNHoxVmpieHpaNEtn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As folks grow older, many health fears come to mind.

The caveat is that most of these haven’t been studied, at least adequately studied, in randomized clinical trials,” said Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, following the guidance below isn’t going to totally prevent a dementia diagnosis, but these are habits that also benefit your health as a whole. So, there’s no reason not to follow them, whether they are good for lowering your dementia risk, chance of a heart attack or bettering your mood.

Ignoring the impact food has on your brain health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many of the things that we talk about for dementia prevention or brain health optimization are the types of things that people will be familiar with hearing from cardiovascular and other health initiatives,” said &lt;a href="https://gwdocs.com/profile/christina-prather" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Christina Prather" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://gwdocs.com/profile/christina-prather" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Christina Prather&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine &amp;amp; Health Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We always have said, what’s good for the heart is good for the brain,” &lt;a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/3824747/Rudolph-Tanzi" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Rudy Tanzi" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/3824747/Rudolph-Tanzi" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Rudy Tanzi&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/good-cholesterol-alzheimers-disease-risk_l_67191247e4b0cd4214d8229e" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="previously told HuffPost" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67191247e4b0cd4214d8229e" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;previously told HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as the Mediterranean diet ― which is &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="high in healthy fats, lean meats" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;high in healthy fats, lean meats&lt;/a&gt;, whole grains, fruits and veggies — is good for your heart health, it’s also good for your brain health, and is a diet that Prather recommends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also suggest following the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/mind-diet-boost-memory" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="MIND diet" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/mind-diet-boost-memory" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, which encourages whole grains, beans, berries, leafy greens, fish, olive oil and other foods that are said to have brain health benefits. A plant-based diet is also a good one to follow for brain health, Prather noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Not managing other health issues like diabetes, high blood pressure and more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t shy away from managing your medical conditions, Prather said. Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol are dementia risk factors, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Really aggressively managing those risk factors is well established to be a way of reducing the risk of cognitive health dementia in the future,” Prather said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is particularly important for vascular risk factors like atrial fibrillation or high blood pressure or hyperlipidemia,” Ellison added. Doing so protects circulation, blood supply and oxygen supply to the brain, Ellison noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important for the prevention of vascular dementia in particular, which happens &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vascular-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20378793" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="when blood flow" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vascular-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20378793" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;when blood flow&lt;/a&gt; is blocked to the brain. Vascular dementia is a common kind of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Not getting enough restorative sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People need to sleep adequately because the brain renews itself during deep sleep and lowers its concentration of beta amyloid, which is the toxic protein that contributes to the development of Alzheimer’s disease,” said Ellison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prather added that you should also be sure to treat any sleep disorders that are interfering with your rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is an epidemic of undiagnosed sleep apnea in older adults,” Prather said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sleep apnea results in poor-quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep can also be impacted by the use of medications that induce sleep, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those are all signs your body is not getting the restorative sleep that it needs to consolidate memories and to have the most optimal cognitive function going forward,” said Prather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Not making time for friends and family.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to prioritize social connections, said Prather. “We know that loneliness and depression and isolation are exceptionally negative for health,” she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They have impacts on cognition as well as mortality,” said Prather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loneliness is an epidemic among older adults, and has a mortality associated with it [that’s] similar to &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/news/america%E2%80%99s-loneliness-epidemic-what-is-to-be-done" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="moderate smoking" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://weillcornell.org/news/america%E2%80%99s-loneliness-epidemic-what-is-to-be-done" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;moderate smoking&lt;/a&gt;,” said Ellison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping your mind socially engaged is also an important way to stay cognitively engaged, Prather said, whether that’s by taking part in conversations or listening to stories from loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Drinking too much alcohol.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of recent research has found that alcohol is not good for your health. It can &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/your-body-on-alcohol-how-it-affects-your-heart-liver-weight-and-cancer-risk-goog_l_6776e00fe4b0b748756170d3" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="lead to" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6776e00fe4b0b748756170d3" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;lead to&lt;/a&gt; liver damage, increase your risk of certain cancers, and it’s also not good for your brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tell people, if you’re having issues with your cognition or you’re worried about your memory, one of the first pieces of advice I’m going to give you is to reduce your alcohol use,” said Prather. Just like our body as a whole, the liver is aging and can’t handle alcohol the same way it could when you were 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The other piece about alcohol is not only that, it’s a direct toxin (we increasingly know it increases risk for almost all cancers), but it can really disrupt sleep,” Prather said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you have a drink before bed, notice how it impacts your sleep, she suggested. And, as mentioned above, it’s important to get restorative sleep to reduce your dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 65, it’s recommended that folks have no more than one standard drink a day and no more than seven in a week, Prather noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The CDC recommends" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;The CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; no more than two drinks each day for men and no more than one for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Halfpoint Images via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Halfpoint Images via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Head injuries are associated with a higher dementia risk, which makes it important to wear a helmet when getting on your bike.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Skipping out on exercise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ellison, it’s important to both live a generally active lifestyle and get in aerobic and other forms of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could mean walking to do your errands instead of driving while also making plans to go to a workout class or go for a bike ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s recommended that older adults exercise 30 minutes aerobically, five days a week, but only about 10% of those over 75 meet that level of activity,” said Ellison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is good for your cardiovascular health, which, as mentioned above, is also good for your brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prather added that fitness is something you should be prioritizing no matter your age and, “well before any cognitive changes happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.

There is a consistent association that head injuries likely do play a role in dementia risk, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;How large of a role does it play in someone’s dementia risk? “The answer might be that it doesn’t play a huge role at a population level, but on an individual level, it’s probably really important,” said Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.

I think everyone is aware of that. But it’s increasing in part because the number of people living to a very old age is increasing,” said Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most dementia happens in older folks, Henderson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, on the bright side, “if you look at the actual chance of getting dementia at a particular age, it’s actually come down slightly, not a whole lot, but slightly, and it seems to parallel advances in taking care of cardiovascular health,” Henderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also now disease-modifying FDA-approved medications for the most common form of dementia, which is Alzheimer’s, said Ellison, who stressed that it’s important to start these medications early on in the disease course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes it important to talk to your doctor if you do notice that you have cognitive challenges such as &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/10_signs" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="frequently misplacing items" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68814f49e4b0cde1a1cbd4bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/10_signs" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;frequently misplacing items&lt;/a&gt;, memory changes that disturb your life or have trouble solving problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Forget the usual strolls—there’s a game-changing activity that combines cardio, coordination, and community in one fun package.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="more-49428"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="A_low-impact_high-reward_activity"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A low-impact, high-reward activity&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget watching my friend Martin, 62, gingerly step onto the court for the first time. Within minutes he was darting side to side, laughing as he chased the small plastic ball. Unlike jogging, this sport is gentle on the joints while still delivering a serious &lt;strong&gt;aerobic &lt;a href="https://chicagoaudible.com/musculation-a-jeun/" data-type="post" data-id="49395"&gt;workout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;—perfect for bodies that creak more than they used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Pickleball_the_unexpected_champion"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Pickleball: the unexpected champion&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, pickleball has surged in popularity among those aged 60 and up. Played with a paddle and perforated ball on a badminton-sized court, it blends elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong. According to the American Heart Association, players can burn up to &lt;strong&gt;500 calories in an hour&lt;/strong&gt;, all without the pounding you get from running. Best of all, the compact court keeps you moving in short bursts, improving agility, balance, and hand-eye coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pickleball offers a remarkable balance of cardiovascular and muscular engagement,” says Dr. Emily Carter, a sports medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic. “It’s ideal for older adults looking to maintain health without overexertion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Starting_off_gear_technique_and_community"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Starting off: gear, technique, and community&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting started is as simple as grabbing a paddle, a pair of court shoes, and finding a local club. Many community centers offer beginner clinics—last month, my neighbor Joan signed up for her first lesson and was hooked immediately by the social aspect. Beginners often worry about the rules, but most clubs encourage a “no-pressure” environment where newcomers rotate in and out of games until they’re comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gear tip: Look for a paddle with a slightly larger sweet spot to reduce mishits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technique tip: Focus on your serve—a gentle underhand toss keeps the ball in play longer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Community tip: Join a weekly mixer; the camaraderie is half the fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Beyond_the_court_mental_and_social_perks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Beyond the court: mental and social perks&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the physical benefits are clear, don’t overlook the mental stimulus—strategy, quick decisions, and friendly rivalries all sharpen the mind. Plus, sharing laughs over a game or two combats isolation, a common challenge after retirement. As the International Council on Active Aging reports, group sports can boost mood and reduce stress, making pickleball a true all-around tonic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re chasing a fast serve or simply craving a new way to connect, &lt;strong&gt;pickleball&lt;/strong&gt; stands out as the best sport after 60. It’s not just about staying fit; it’s about rediscovering joy in movement and friendship. Ready to give it a swing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Chicago Audible</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOczdwZGg2enVJUF82UzdNNE9VNjJScksxeXdIYk5LNjFvVkNMWUgwZmlOZmZDWjdmamFGS19fVG9FSVhvUVRqMHJBeVVnUm5VZzhCN2tsOWwtVVhZb3pwTUlpRHUyMi1XaUozTW5TNVZIZjN3bGhoMDBGWWhTSEI4VEd4bjZnLVpYY3NDZWJrQQ</guid></item><item><title>我以为我患有几乎所有女性都会出现的更年期症状......事实上，这是一个无法手术的脑肿瘤-每日邮报 | I thought I was suffering a menopause symptom almost all women get... in fact, it was an inoperable brain tumour - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mother-of-one who dismissed her forgetfulness as a &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/menopause/index.html" id="mol-9b74c570-6940-11f0-b82e-b7622bca71d2"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; symptom was devastated to be told she had an inoperable brain tumour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;April Tate, 52, from Burntisland in Fife, first became concerned in 2018 when she forgot a child's name while working as a childminder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Believing it was hormonal, she mentioned it during a routine GP phone call—only to be asked to attend the surgery immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A scan at her local hospital revealed a mass deep in the centre of her brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors diagnosed her with a posterior falcine meningioma—a low-grade tumour in a location too dangerous for surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;April, a single parent to daughter Abby, was placed on 'watch and wait,' with regular scans every six months. The tumour initially grew slowly, but in late 2022, it began to increase in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still under 30mm, it qualified for stereotactic radiotherapy — a targeted form of radiation that minimises damage to surrounding brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;April said: 'When they said I had a brain tumour, my first thought was that I was going to die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;April Tate, 52, from Burntisland in Fife, first became concerned in 2018 when she forgot a child's name while working as a childminder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;April is pictured here with her radiotherapy mask&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was a numbing moment. I was a single mum, and my daughter Abby was still a teenager. All I could think about was not being there for her.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Being self-employed meant taking time off for treatment brought financial pressure too, which just added to the stress.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'When the surgeon explained the tumour was located in a really difficult part of my brain and he'd only attempted surgery in that area once before, it was hard to accept.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, April was placed on a programme of regular scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'It was terrifying to live with the unknown of whether it would grow or not. Over time, I began to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The tumour was slow-growing, and for a while, it didn't change much.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in late 2022, the tumour had grown. It was still under 30mm, meaning April qualified for stereotactic radiotherapy. The treatment, though precise, took its toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The radiotherapy itself was fairly quick each day, but it was exhausting,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors diagnosed her with a posterior falcine meningioma—a low-grade tumour in a location too dangerous for surgery. April's brain scan is pictured above, the tumour showing in white&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The team had to make a custom mask to keep my head completely still, which felt claustrophobic and intense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just closed my eyes, listened to music and tried to stay calm. The hardest part came afterwards, with having to wait to find out if it had worked.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To her relief, the tumour had shrunk. Follow-up scans have shown further reduction, and April now has annual monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has since returned to work and even completed her first 5k run earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meningiomas are the most common type of brain tumour, accounting for around a third of all cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They form in the meninges—the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord—and are usually slow-growing and benign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, their location can make them dangerous. A posterior falcine meningioma develops near the falx cerebri, a narrow fold of tissue between the two hemispheres of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tumours in this region are deep-seated and often close to critical structures, such as major blood vessels, making surgery extremely risky or impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Meningiomas are the most common type of brain tumour, accounting for around a third of all cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Determined to make a difference, April is taking on the 88 Squats a Day in July challenge, supporting Brain Tumour Research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms depend on the tumour's size and location but can include headaches, vision problems, memory loss, or changes in behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients, like April, initially dismiss early warning signs as stress, ageing, or hormonal changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy, or 'watch and wait' monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as active surveillance, this approach is often used for slow-growing brain tumours that aren’t causing serious symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rather than rushing into surgery or radiotherapy, doctors monitor the tumour with regular MRI scans—typically every six to 12 months—to track its growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This strategy is considered safe when the tumour is low-grade (non-cancerous), small in size, and not located near areas of the brain that control critical functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It helps avoid the risks of invasive treatment unless absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the psychological toll can be significant. Patients live with the knowledge that the tumour is still there, and if it starts to grow or cause problems, they may need treatment such as surgery or radiotherapy later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April’s case, her tumour’s position meant surgery was ruled out — but she was able to undergo stereotactic radiotherapy, a targeted form of treatment that can shrink tumours while sparing surrounding healthy brain tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Determined to make a difference, April is taking on the 88 Squats a Day in July challenge, supporting Brain Tumour Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/April1749638978570"&gt; challenge&lt;/a&gt; aims to raise £2,740—the amount needed to fund a single day of research ​at the Scottish Brain Tumour​ ​Research Centre of Excellence, in​ collaboration with Beatson Cancer Charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is raising the cash via the website &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/April1749638978570"&gt;JustGiving&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;April said: 'People hear the words "benign" or "low-grade" and assume it's nothing serious, but I still live with this every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's something in my brain that shouldn't be there, and it could change at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I even worried about how it might affect new relationships and not wanting to burden someone else with what I was going through.

That has to change.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;​​Ashley McWilliams, community development manager at Brain Tumour Research,​ said: 'April's ​story is​ a ​powerful​ reminder that brain tumours can be easily missed or mistaken for everyday health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Her strength in facing such a frightening diagnosis, and her commitment to raising awareness, is incredibly inspiring.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions suffering from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a debilitating condition often overlooked due to the lack of diagnostic tools, may be closer to personalized care, according to new research that shows how the disease disrupts interactions between the microbiome, immune system, and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings—potentially relevant to long COVID due to its similarity with ME/CFS—come from data on 249 individuals analyzed using a new artificial intelligence (AI) platform that identifies disease biomarkers from stool, blood, and other routine lab tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study achieved 90% accuracy in distinguishing individuals with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+fatigue+syndrome/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic fatigue syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which is significant because doctors currently lack reliable biomarkers for diagnosis," said study author Dr. Derya Unutmaz, Professor of immunology at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some physicians doubt it as a real disease due to the absence of clear laboratory markers, sometimes attributing it to psychological factors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Dr. Julia Oh, formerly at JAX and now a microbiologist and professor at Duke University, in collaboration with ME/CFS clinicians Lucinda Bateman and Suzanne Vernon of the Bateman Horne Center, and Unutmaz, who directs the JAX ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details appear in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03788-3" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mapping the invisible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by severe symptoms that significantly impair physical and mental activities, including persistent fatigue, sleep abnormalities, dizziness, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts often compare ME/CFS to long COVID, as both conditions frequently follow viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus. In the United States, ME/CFS affects between 836,000 and 3.3 million individuals— many undiagnosed—and costs the economy $18 to $51 billion annually due to health care expenditures and lost productivity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Prior studies have noted immune disruptions in ME/CFS, Unutmaz said. This new research builds upon those findings by investigating how the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+microbiome/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, its metabolites, and immune responses interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team linked these connections to 12 classes of patient-reported symptoms, which were aggregated from hundreds of datapoints generated by patient health and lifestyle surveys. These include sleep disturbances, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and other symptoms the researchers mapped in their entirety from microbiome changes to metabolites, immune responses, and clinical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We integrated clinical symptoms with cutting-edge omics technologies to identify new biomarkers of ME/CFS," Oh said. "Linking symptoms at this level is crucial, because ME/CFS is highly variable. Patients experience a wide range of symptoms that differ in severity and duration, and current methods can't fully capture that complexity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, the researchers analyzed comprehensive data collected from the Bateman Horne Center, a leading ME/CFS, long COVID, and fibromyalgia research center in Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ruoyun Xiong, also a lead author on the study, developed a deep neural network model called BioMapAI. The tool integrates gut metagenomics, plasma metabolomics, immune cell profiles, blood test data, and clinical symptoms from 153 patients and 96 healthy individuals over four years.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Immune cell analysis proved most accurate in predicting symptom severity, while microbiome data best predicted gastrointestinal, emotional, and sleep disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model connected thousands of patient data points, reconstructing symptoms such as pain and gastrointestinal issues, among several others. It also revealed that patients who were ill for less than four years had fewer disrupted networks than those who were ill for more than ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our data indicate these biological disruptions become more entrenched over time," Unutmaz said. "That doesn't mean longer-duration ME/CFS can't be reversed, but it may be more challenging."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 96 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, showing balanced microbiome-metabolite-immune interactions, in contrast to significant disruptions in ME/CFS patients linked to fatigue, pain, emotional regulation issues, and sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ME/CFS patients also had lower levels of butyrate, a beneficial fatty acid produced in the gut, along with other nutrients essential for metabolism, inflammation control, and energy. Patients with elevated levels of tryptophan, benzoate, and other markers indicated a microbial imbalance. Heightened inflammatory responses, particularly involving MAIT cells sensitive to gut microbial health, were also observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"MAIT cells bridge gut health to broader immune functions, and their disruption alongside butyrate and tryptophan pathways, normally anti-inflammatory, suggests a profound imbalance," said Unutmaz.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;An actionable dataset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the findings require further validation, they significantly advance scientists' understanding of ME/CFS and provide clearer hypotheses for future research, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since animal models can't fully reflect the complex neurological, physiological, immune, and other system disruptions seen in ME/CFS, Oh said it will be crucial to study humans directly to identify modifiable factors and develop targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The microbiome and metabolome are dynamic," Oh said. "That means we may be able to intervene—through diet, lifestyle, or targeted therapies—in ways that genomic data alone can't offer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BioMapAI also achieved roughly 80% accuracy in external data sets, confirming key biomarkers identified in the original group. This consistency across diverse data was striking, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Despite diverse data collection methods, common disease signatures emerged in fatty acids, immune markers, and metabolites," Oh said. "That tells us this is not random. This is real biological dysregulation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers intend to share their dataset broadly with BioMapAI, which supports analyses across diverse symptoms and diseases, effectively integrating multi-omics data that are difficult to replicate in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our goal is to build a detailed map of how the immune system interacts with gut bacteria and the chemicals they produce," Oh said. "By connecting these dots we can start to understand what's driving the disease and pave the way for genuinely precise medicine that has long been out of reach."&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Biomaterials&lt;/em&gt;, a team led by chemical and nano engineers at the University of California San Diego took a closer look at how the cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), unlike other plant viruses, is uniquely effective at activating the body's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preclinical studies, CPMV has demonstrated potent anti-tumor effects in multiple mouse models, as well as in canine cancer patients. When injected directly into tumors, CPMV therapy recruits innate immune cells -- such as neutrophils, macrophages and natural killer cells -- into the tumor microenvironment to destroy cancer cells. Meanwhile, it activates B cells and T cells to establish systemic, long-lasting anti-tumor memory. This immune reawakening not only helps clear the targeted tumor but also primes the immune system to hunt down metastatic tumors elsewhere in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is fascinating that CPMV but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; other plant viruses stimulates an anti-tumor response," said Nicole Steinmetz, the Leo and Trude Szilard Chancellor's Endowed Chair in the Aiiso Yufeng Li Family Department of Chemical and Nano Engineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering and the study's corresponding author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This work gives us insight into how CPMV works so well," said study first author Anthony Omole, a chemical and nano engineering Ph.D. student in Steinmetz's lab. "What we found most exciting is that although human immune cells are not infected by CPMV, they respond to it and are reprogrammed towards an activated state, which ultimately trains them to detect and eradicate cancerous cells."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key question in translating CPMV to human cancer patients has been: what makes this plant virus so effective at fighting cancer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate, Omole, Steinmetz and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute's ​​Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory performed a side-by-side comparison of CPMV with the cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV), a closely related plant virus that does not exhibit anti-tumor effects when administered intratumorally. Both viruses form similarly sized nanoparticles and are taken up by human immune cells at similar rates. Yet, once inside, the viruses produce different outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPMV, the team found, stimulates type I, II and III interferons -- proteins with well-known anti-cancer properties. "This is particularly interesting because some of the earliest cancer immunotherapy drugs were recombinant interferons," noted Omole. Meanwhile, CCMV stimulates a set of pro-inflammatory interleukins that do not translate to effective tumor clearance. Another difference lies in how these viruses' RNAs are processed within mammalian cells. CPMV RNAs persist longer and get delivered to the endolysosome, where they activate toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a critical component in priming antiviral -- and more importantly -- anti-tumor immune responses. CCMV RNAs, on the other hand, fail to reach this activation point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPMV also offers a unique advantage as a cost-effective immunotherapy. Unlike many other therapies that require complex and costly manufacturing, CPMV can be produced using molecular farming. "It can be grown in plants using sunlight, soil and water," Omole said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is working toward advancing CPMV to clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The present study provides important insights into the mechanism of action of CPMV. We are diligently working toward the next steps to ensure that the most potent lead candidate is selected to achieve anti-tumor efficacy and safety," Steinmetz said. "This is the time and we are poised to move this work beyond the bench and toward clinical trials."&lt;/p&gt;

                Xerius Jackson, age 7, gets an MMR vaccine at a clinic in Lubbock, Texas, on March 1, two months into a multistate outbreak of measles that began in January. During this time, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made changes to how the federal government assesses vaccine recommendations.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For two decades, Washington, D.C., pediatrician &lt;a href="https://appointments.childrensnational.org/provider/olanrewaju-omolayo-falusi/2359516" target="_blank"&gt;Lanre Falusi&lt;/a&gt; has counseled parents about vaccine safety, side effects and timing. But this year, she said, the conversations have changed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For the first time, I'm having parents of newborns ask me if their baby will still be able to get vaccines," Falusi said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Throughout the U.S., pediatricians say anxious parents are concerned about access to routine childhood immunizations. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's especially true for those with children covered by Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income families and people with disabilities. Medicaid covers 4 in 10 children in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It really became an issue when RFK Jr. stepped into the role of HHS secretary," said &lt;a href="https://palmettopediatric.com/downtown-office.php" target="_blank"&gt;Deborah Greenhouse&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The concern accelerated after the shake-up of a key Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine advisory body&lt;/a&gt; in June, raising fears that millions of American families could soon have to pay out of pocket for shots now covered by their health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, removed all 17 members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the panel responsible for recommending which shots are included in the nation's adult and childhood immunization schedules.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy replaced the panelists with new members aligned with his views, prompting alarm among medical professionals and public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Insurance uncertainty worries parents&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People should be worried about what's going to happen to the availability of vaccines for children," said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurers are &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/acip-cdc-and-insurance-coverage-of-vaccines-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank"&gt;required to cover&lt;/a&gt; all ACIP-recommended vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;States and other jurisdictions use the childhood vaccine schedule to set immunization requirements for schoolchildren. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;ACIP's recommendations also determine which vaccines get covered by the Vaccines for Children Program, a CDC-funded initiative that provides free immunizations to low-income and uninsured children. Half of children in the U.S. are eligible for the VFC Program.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the new ACIP members withdraw support for a particular vaccine and the CDC director agrees, Tolbert said, the consequences would be immediate. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It would automatically affect what is covered and therefore which vaccines are available to children on Medicaid," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Health insurance companies have not yet said how they would alter coverage, but Tolbert said such a move would open the door for private insurers to refuse to cover the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatricians worry about a future where parents might have to choose: pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket for shots or leave their kids unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/" target="_blank"&gt;health insurance industry group AHIP&lt;/a&gt; said that health plans "continue to follow federal requirements related to coverage of ACIP-recommended vaccines and will continue to support broad access to critical preventive services, including immunizations."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatricians say news about President Trump's new budget law, which is expected to reduce Medicaid spending by about $1 trillion over the next decade, has also prompted questions from parents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While parents may be worried about losing their Medicaid, the law doesn't mention vaccines or change eligibility or benefits for children's Medicaid, Tolbert said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But less federal funding means states will have to make decisions about who is covered and which services are offered.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To raise the revenue needed to pay for Medicaid, states could raise taxes; move money earmarked for other spending, such as education or corrections; or, more likely, reduce Medicaid spending.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And they may do that by cutting eligibility for optional populations or by cutting services that are optional, or by reducing payments to providers in the form of provider rates," Tolbert said. "It's unclear how this will play out, and it will likely look different across all states."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In May, Kennedy announced in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC is no longer recommending the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children and pregnant women. The move &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/FiledSuit.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;prompted a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other physician groups that seeks to freeze Kennedy's directive.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And in June, the new ACIP members appointed by Kennedy voted to recommend that adults and children no longer receive flu vaccines with thimerosal, a preservative rarely used in some flu vaccines. Anti-vaccine activists, including Kennedy, have &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-is-thimerosal-what-the-research-says-about-the-vaccine-preservative-under-fire-by-rfk-jr" target="_blank"&gt;rallied against thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; for decades, alleging links to autism despite no evidence of any association.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"There is no cause for concern," Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in a statement. "As Secretary Kennedy has stated, no one will be denied access to a licensed vaccine if they choose to receive one."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When the ACIP committee met last month, they reaffirmed that flu vaccines will remain accessible and covered, and they emphasized safety by ensuring these vaccines are mercury-free," Hilliard wrote. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program continues to provide COVID-19 vaccines at no cost for eligible children when the parent, provider, and patient decide vaccination is appropriate. Medicaid will continue to reimburse the administration fee."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the possibility that a vaccine could be restricted or no longer covered by insurance is already changing how parents approach immunization. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Falusi's practice, parents are scheduling appointments to coincide precisely with their child's eligibility, sometimes making appointments the same week as their birthdays.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Doctors warn that fewer kids may get shots if cost shifts to families&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journey-pediatrics.com/our-team/" target="_blank"&gt;Melissa Mason&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician in Albuquerque, N.M., has treated some patients who got measles during the multistate outbreak that started in neighboring Texas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She's concerned that any new limitations on access or reimbursement for childhood vaccines could lead to even more preventable illnesses and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nationally, there have been more than 1,300 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt; since January, including three deaths, according to the CDC. "We're seeing this outbreak because vaccination rates are too low and it allows measles to spread in the community," Mason said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Children and teens account for 66% of national measles cases. Mason has begun offering the measles vaccine to infants as young as 6 months old, a full six months earlier than standard practice, though still within federal guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Last year, overall kindergarten &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates fell&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. At the same time, the number of children with a school vaccination exemption continued to rise.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Pertussis, or whooping cough — another disease that can be deadly to young children — is spreading. &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/182774" target="_blank"&gt;As of July 5&lt;/a&gt;, more than 15,100 cases had been identified in U.S. residents this year, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mason said pertussis is especially dangerous to babies too young to receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For now, pediatricians are trying to maintain a sense of urgency without inciting panic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Columbia, S.C., Greenhouse used to offer families a flexible age range for routine vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm not saying that anymore," the pediatrician said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She now urges parents to get their children vaccinated as soon as they are eligible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She described anxious parents asking whether the HPV vaccine, which helps &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/experts-and-stories/the-latest/what-i-tell-every-patient-about-the-hpv-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;prevent cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;, can be administered to children younger than the recommended age of 9.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I actually had two parents today ask if their 7- or 8-year-olds could get the HPV shot," Greenhouse said. "I had to tell them it's not allowed."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With the vaccine requiring multiple doses months apart, Greenhouse fears time may run out for families to get the series covered by insurance. If they have to pay out of pocket, she's afraid some families may choose not to get the second dose. A second dose could cost &lt;a href="https://www.gardasil9.com/patient-a/cost/" target="_blank"&gt;about $300&lt;/a&gt; if no longer covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I cannot be 100% sure what the future looks like for some of these vaccines," Greenhouse said. "I can tell you it's a very scary place to be."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy's newly appointed vaccine advisory committee is expected to hold its next &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;public meeting&lt;/a&gt; as soon as August.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story comes from NPR's health reporting partnership &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When obstetrician &lt;a href="https://uvahealth.com/findadoctor/JoAnn-Pinkerton-1437283801" target="_blank"&gt;JoAnn Pinkerton &lt;/a&gt;spoke on a Food and Drug Administration panel recently, she didn't mince words.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Please stop harming women," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pinkerton argues that the FDA's black box warning labels on hormone replacement therapies make women reluctant to take medications that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/01/1248525256/hormones-menopause-hormone-therapy-hot-flashes" target="_blank"&gt;can be beneficial &lt;/a&gt;for treating the symptoms of menopause.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pinkerton was &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fda-expert-panels/fda-expert-panel-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-women-07172025#event-information" target="_blank"&gt;one of 12&lt;/a&gt; doctors — many of them experts in obstetrics and women's health — who asked the FDA to remove the warning labels for low-dose estrogen treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The medication is typically prescribed to women to mitigate symptoms of menopause or perimenopause. Unlike other systemic hormone therapy treatments that are absorbed by the whole body, it is delivered locally — through a cream or a ring.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The black box warning is the strongest safety label the FDA can put on a prescription medication. And Pinkerton and others argue that such a warning for low-dose estrogen treatment is unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The medication is often prescribed to prevent or address &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/15/nx-s1-5398547/perimenopause-menopause-symptoms-hrt-hormone-therapy" target="_blank"&gt;symptoms associated with menopause&lt;/a&gt;, including frequent urinary tract infections, vaginal dryness and pain during sexual intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" The boxed warning is not supported by science," says Pinkerton. "It overstates risk."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pinkerton described a recent patient suffering from such symptoms, for whom she had written a prescription. She pulls out the tube, "and it says warning: Endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disorders, probable dementia and breast cancer.  And she looks at it, her partner or spouse looks at it and they throw it in the trash," Pinkerton recounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A pendulum swing toward HRT&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The consensus from the medical establishment on the safety of hormone treatment for menopause has changed dramatically in recent decades. In 2002, researchers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6780820/" target="_blank"&gt;partly halted a large study&lt;/a&gt; on women's health — &lt;a href="https://www.whi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;the Women's Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt; — out of concern that hormone therapy was associated with increased risk of cancer and stroke. Breast cancer was a particular concern. Since then, researchers and doctors have determined the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/01/1248525256/hormones-menopause-hormone-therapy-hot-flashes#:~:text=This%20may%20have%20been%20linked,patch%2C%20a%20cream%20or%20gel." target="_blank"&gt;cancer risk was overstated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Treatments and best practices around when to prescribe hormone therapy and what medications exactly to prescribe have evolved in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many doctors in women's health have advocated for this change for years without success. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/01/1248525256/hormones-menopause-hormone-therapy-hot-flashes#:~:text=This%20may%20have%20been%20linked,patch%2C%20a%20cream%20or%20gel." target="_blank"&gt; Recent studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest the cancer risks of some hormone therapies are quite low and there are significant benefits for women going through menopause. This is a pet issue for&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/martin-makary" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Marty Makary&lt;/a&gt; —  the current FDA commissioner. Makary is a surgeon, not an obstetrician. He convened the panel.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Fifty million-plus women have not been offered the incredible potential health benefits of hormone replacement therapy," Makary said in opening remarks at the panel, "because of medical dogma."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Makary said his own family could have benefited from this treatment when it fell out of favor with the medical establishment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" One of those women was my mother," he said, "who went through perimenopause around that time."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Obstetricians and gynecologists interviewed for this story agreed they would like to see the black box label removed for low-dose vaginal estrogen treatments that carry lower cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" I usually will make a little joke about, hey, we've been working for many years to try to get that black box warning removed, but you know how slow government things can take," said &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/monica-christmas" target="_blank"&gt;Dr.  Monica Christmas&lt;/a&gt;, who regularly prescribes such treatments to her patients. Christmas is an OB-GYN who is also the associate medical director for &lt;a href="https://menopause.org/" target="_blank"&gt;The Menopause Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Christmas expressed reticence, however, about removing labels for &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372" target="_blank"&gt;systemic estrogen,&lt;/a&gt; which carries a different risk profile for cancer. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" For the vast majority of people, the risk is low, even for systemic hormone therapy," said Christmas, "but it's not zero." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Christmas said the black box warning can prompt doctors and patients to have necessary conversations about the risks and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;benefits of such medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The FDA panel focused primarily on low-dose estrogen, but Makary also hinted at removing the label for systemic therapy, mentioning the benefits as suggested in some studies for &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/2016/menopausal-hormone-therapy-improves-bone-health" target="_blank"&gt;reduced risk of osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We want to learn from all of you," Makary said to the panel members, "help guide us as we think through what should be done here at the FDA."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"This was theater, not scientific evaluation"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The panel was a departure from typical decision-making at the FDA. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This was theater, this was not scientific evaluation," said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RYRnAAO/adriane-fughberman-md" target="_blank"&gt;Adriane Fugh-Berman,&lt;/a&gt;a professor of pharmacology at Georgetown University. Fugh-Berman is &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2025/0700/editorials-menopausal-hormone-therapy.html" target="_blank"&gt;skeptical of removing&lt;/a&gt; such labels and points out that the FDA usually has a more rigorous process to inform these kinds of changes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That process is being undermined and distorted," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;(Fugh-Berman has worked as a paid expert witness in litigation against pharmaceutical companies accused of overselling the benefits of hormone therapy and contributing to breast cancer.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;FDA decision-making often involves a period of public input. Committees are appointed to study issues and make recommendations. Fugh-Berman said she would have preferred to see a period of public comment as well as an expert committee that included a wider range of experts such as epidemiologists, oncologists and experts in public health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Representatives from the FDA did not respond to a request for comment on this story or offer comment on future steps in a potential process to remove the warnings from prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At least one obstetrician celebrated the increased attention to this issue, even if it came through an unconventional process. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was very happy," said&lt;a href="https://www.rachelrubinmd.com/" target="_blank"&gt; Rachel Rubin, a urologist&lt;/a&gt; with a specialty in sexual medicine. Rubin was also a panel member. " The fact that the head of the FDA wants to be talking about this topic is extraordinary and something we've all been dreaming about," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; Rubin acknowledged the departure from the level of rigor to which the FDA usually adheres.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Were there voices missing? Of course," she says. But given this opportunity, she said, it's worth showing up to "fight for something you've been fighting for for decades."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;OB-GYN Monica Christmas wouldn't say whether she thought the composition of the panel should have been different or the process more rigorous. But she did express concern that enthusiasm for hormonal treatment for menopause may be eclipsing the necessary risk-benefit analysis that patients and doctors need to make when considering these medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Hormone therapy has become synonymous with menopause," she says. And she cautions that women&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/15/nx-s1-5398547/perimenopause-menopause-symptoms-hrt-hormone-therapy" target="_blank"&gt; should rule out other issues&lt;/a&gt; before they jump to hormone therapy. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's almost like, 'Oh, I'm in menopause,'" says Christmas, "I should have to be on hormone therapy for all of these magical or mystical benefits."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European regulators have greenlit a twice-yearly injection to prevent HIV that has been hailed as a game-changer in the course of the epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jab from the drugmaker Gilead was considered one of the biggest medical breakthroughs of 2024, offering an alternative to daily pills. &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2024/07/24/stunning-study-shows-twice-a-year-jab-could-offer-100-protection-against-hiv-infection"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The drug, called lenacapavir,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was 100 per cent effective at preventing the virus in clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;        

&lt;p&gt;It is a form of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which works by preventing the virus from replicating and spreading within the body. It reduces the risk of acquiring HIV among both adults and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) advisory committee issued a positive opinion of the drug on Friday, clearing the way for the European Commission to approve the drug in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This milestone reflects our commitment to reimagine HIV prevention in Europe and around the world,” Dr Dietmar Berger, Gilead Sciences’ chief medical officer, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lenacapavir for PrEP has the potential to become a critical tool for public health, helping to expand prevention options for people who face the highest barriers to care”.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;While there has been progress in the fight against HIV, cases have been rising. In 2023, there were more than 24,700 &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2024/11/28/number-of-europeans-diagnosed-with-hiv-rose-in-2023-with-new-cases-in-most-countries"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;new HIV diagnoses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway, up 11.8 per cent from 2022.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"PrEP is a cornerstone of HIV-control efforts in Europe and worldwide and is very effective at preventing infections if taken as prescribed," the EMA &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/new-injection-easier-prevention-hiv-infection-eu-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, uptake and adherence are often suboptimal because access to some medicines is limited, and other available medicines require strict daily intake".&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;That's why health experts believe that having a twice-yearly injection available could boost efforts to control HIV, which affects about &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;40.8 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. An estimated 630,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved the new drug last month. In the EU, Gilead expects to sell it under the name Yeytuo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilead has &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/07/10/millions-will-die-in-coming-years-if-us-funding-for-hiv-programmes-is-not-replaced-un-warn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;agreed to sell generic versions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the drug in 120 lower-income countries with high HIV rates. But it is not yet clear how widely available it will be after the United States, which has traditionally been a major global health donor, slashed funding earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated July 25:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with a comment from the European Medicines Agency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists are raising urgent alarms about the possibility of a &lt;strong&gt;supervolcano eruption&lt;/strong&gt; that could occur in the coming years—an event with the potential for &lt;strong&gt;catastrophic destruction&lt;/strong&gt; on a scale not witnessed since the early 19th century. This growing threat shines a harsh light on &lt;strong&gt;humanity’s lack of preparedness&lt;/strong&gt; and sparks serious questions about whether civilization is ready to face such an existential challenge. By revisiting dramatic past eruptions and considering current scientific predictions, it becomes clear just how real—and devastating—this scenario has become.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is a supervolcano and why does it matter?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The term “supervolcano” describes volcanic events so immense that they can blanket entire continents in ash and trigger &lt;strong&gt;climate chaos&lt;/strong&gt; across the globe. Unlike typical volcanoes, these geological giants possess the power to alter planetary history in a single, explosive moment. Their vast calderas lie dormant for centuries, accumulating pressure until a monumental release of gases and molten rock brings devastation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While many associate natural disasters with earthquakes or floods, a &lt;strong&gt;supervolcanic eruption&lt;/strong&gt; would easily surpass those in scale and impact. The Tambora eruption of 1815 remains a chilling example, as it brought about lasting global consequences that reshaped societies for years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supervolcano eruptions&lt;/strong&gt; eject hundreds of cubic kilometers of ash and debris into the atmosphere.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The release of &lt;strong&gt;sulfur dioxide&lt;/strong&gt; forms aerosols that block sunlight from reaching Earth’s surface.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This leads to sudden drops in temperature and widespread &lt;strong&gt;climate disruption&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How do scientists predict a supervolcano eruption?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers carefully monitor seismic activity, land deformation, and rising magma levels to assess the risk of a major eruption. Using advanced technologies like satellite imagery and chemical sensors, scientists strive to forecast the likelihood of a &lt;strong&gt;massive volcanic eruption&lt;/strong&gt;. However, even with these tools, significant uncertainties persist, making the precise timing of such events extremely difficult to determine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Markus Stoffel, climatologist at the University of Geneva, underscores the urgency by estimating a &lt;strong&gt;one in six chance&lt;/strong&gt; of a planet-altering eruption this century. Despite this sobering statistic, there remains no comprehensive plan to confront a disaster of this magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Role of sulfur dioxide and climate disruption&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The primary danger stems not from lava flows but from enormous quantities of &lt;strong&gt;sulfur dioxide&lt;/strong&gt; released during a supervolcano eruption. Once injected into the stratosphere, this gas transforms into reflective aerosols, effectively forming a barrier that reduces sunlight and causes &lt;strong&gt;global temperatures&lt;/strong&gt; to plummet. Such rapid cooling can trigger famines and ecological crises worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 1991 Pinatubo eruption, though far less powerful, resulted in a 0.5°C decrease in global temperature—a warning sign of what a true super-eruption could unleash. In such a scenario, failed crops, disrupted supply chains, and unprecedented hardship would follow on a global scale. Additionally, engaging with challenging visual puzzles related to cognitive science, such as those found in &lt;a href="https://www.southbeachbulletin.com/trends/"&gt;brain teasers and IQ puzzles&lt;/a&gt;, can offer insight into human problem-solving under uncertainty, which is crucial when preparing for unpredictable natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Signs before a supereruption?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Potential warning signs often include swarms of small earthquakes, unusual hot springs, ground swelling, or increased emissions of volcanic gases. These indicators may surface weeks to years ahead of a &lt;strong&gt;supervolcano eruption&lt;/strong&gt;, but interpreting them requires vigilant observation and constant research. Even with technological advances, predicting the exact moment of eruption remains nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This uncertainty poses immense challenges for governments and emergency planners, who must weigh risks without any clear timetable or effective response strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Historical precedents: catastrophic eruptions with global impact&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;History is filled with reminders of the extraordinary power lurking beneath the earth’s surface. Prehistoric &lt;strong&gt;supervolcano eruptions&lt;/strong&gt; have shaped continents and driven near-extinction events. Even in more recent times, volcanic disasters have caused enormous suffering and upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Toba eruption some twelve thousand years ago nearly wiped out humanity, according to genetic studies. More recently, the 1815 Tambora explosion triggered the infamous “year without summer,” leading to massive food shortages and social turmoil around the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global harvests collapsed under persistent cold and darkened skies.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Widespread famine and disease outbreaks claimed millions of lives in Asia and Europe.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Social unrest soared as desperate populations struggled for survival.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What consequences could the next supervolcano bring?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a &lt;strong&gt;supervolcano eruption&lt;/strong&gt; were to occur within the next months or decades, the results would likely be disastrous. &lt;strong&gt;Global temperatures&lt;/strong&gt; could drop several degrees, and essential weather patterns—such as Asian and African monsoons—could falter, causing massive famines and economic collapse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is profound uncertainty surrounding how to prepare for such a large-scale &lt;strong&gt;natural disaster&lt;/strong&gt;. The risk of suddenly entering a world marked by dimmed sunlight, crop failures, and financial ruin cannot be dismissed as mere speculation. Markus Stoffel’s estimate of a one in six chance during this century makes the call for action all the more urgent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ecosystem and agricultural collapse&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modern agriculture depends on reliable sunlight and warmth. A thick veil of volcanic aerosols would severely disrupt photosynthesis and stunt plant growth over vast regions. Livestock feed would dwindle, and marine ecosystems might also suffer from abrupt surface temperature changes. There is currently no robust strategy capable of sustaining global food supplies under these pressures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Areas reliant on stable rainfall—especially those affected by monsoon cycles—could experience both drought and flooding as climate patterns shift unpredictably. Disruptions in staple food trade would send shockwaves through economies around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Would the effects lead to mass extinction?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although modern technology offers advantages unknown in earlier centuries, experts caution that today’s systems could still buckle under the stress of a &lt;strong&gt;supervolcano-induced apocalypse&lt;/strong&gt;. Prolonged cold, repeated harvest failures, and forced migration could accelerate social breakdown and conflict. While isolated human populations might endure, the collapse of global civilization due to unstoppable &lt;strong&gt;climate disruption&lt;/strong&gt; remains a genuine concern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ongoing research aims to measure civilization’s resilience against nature’s most severe blows. Yet, without concrete contingency plans, society continues to gamble with its future every passing year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why is there such a lack of preparedness for supervolcano threats?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike more frequent threats such as pandemics or asteroid impacts, &lt;strong&gt;supervolcanoes&lt;/strong&gt; rarely attract political attention or media coverage. Emergency planning tends to focus on common disasters, leaving high-impact but rare risks dangerously neglected. As a consequence, authorities have invested little in strategies to survive a prolonged volcanic winter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No international protocols exist for managing year-long crop failures, and there are few reliable reserves to sustain billions facing hunger. Modern logistics and food storage are designed for normal conditions—not ongoing catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Few countries maintain adequate food stockpiles for a long-term &lt;strong&gt;global crisis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Technological solutions such as underground farming remain experimental and unproven at scale.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The absence of coordinated global leadership increases vulnerability to such an event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Is it possible to mitigate the damage of a future supervolcano?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts debate a range of adaptation strategies should another Tambora-sized event threaten the world. Some advocate for strengthening grain reserves, diversifying staple crops, or developing rapid-response aid systems for large-scale agricultural collapse. Others explore geoengineering concepts to counteract sudden &lt;strong&gt;climate cooling&lt;/strong&gt; or provide artificial lighting to key croplands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advancements in volcanology, better international cooperation, and investment in resilient infrastructure may help buy time. Nonetheless, progress is slow compared to the speed at which a &lt;strong&gt;supervolcano eruption&lt;/strong&gt; could cause havoc.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Learning from past mistakes&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studying historical disasters remains vital. The lessons of the “year without summer”—from famine to economic collapse—highlight just how fragile contemporary society can be. Learning from previous &lt;strong&gt;extinction-level natural disasters&lt;/strong&gt; helps guide smarter preparation for future threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Long-term adaptation demands bold, collective thinking focused on survival rather than short-term convenience. Understanding the full scope of &lt;strong&gt;global-scale volcanic eruptions&lt;/strong&gt; inspires innovation and readiness before disaster strikes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;International collaboration and future research&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Existing volcano monitoring networks offer some degree of advance warning, but only broad scientific partnerships can improve predictive capabilities. Funding cooperative research, pooling expertise, and designing multinational recovery initiatives will build stronger global resilience. Establishing robust safety nets transforms warnings from helpless predictions into actionable guidance for the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pushing for greater disaster preparedness against rare yet catastrophic events may ultimately secure humanity’s continuity, even if faced with a truly world-shaking eruption.&lt;/p&gt;

County Department of Public Health officials are investigating two sites in Los Angeles the man visited while infectious, according to a news release. Public spaces where others may have been exposed to the infection are LAX and the Hilton Los Angeles Airport, at 5711 W. Century Blvd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person landed July 5 at LAX; the exact time and flight information were still being investigated, according to the department. The infected individual was at the Hilton from 7:30 p.m. July 5 until checking out at 1 p.m. July 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who were at these locations on these days are urged by the department to monitor potential symptoms for at least three weeks. Symptoms include high fever, coughs, or red, watery eyes, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/communication-resources/clinical-diagnosis-fact-sheet.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also urged to confirm their MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination status. Those who have not been immunized are at higher risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As The Times reported last month, the U.S. is in the midst of its &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-26/more-measles-cases-in-california-this-year-than-reported-in-all-of-2024-data-show"&gt;largest outbreak of measles in decades&lt;/a&gt;, with California already reporting more cases of the disease than in all of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As outbreaks ramp up within the U.S. and internationally, the release said, summer travel can heighten exposure and transmission levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can linger in the air and on surfaces, making it easy to spread, particularly among people who are not already protected from it,” said Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County health officer. “A person can spread the illness to others before they have symptoms, and it can take seven to 21 days for symptoms to show up after exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department encouraged all residents to review their immunization records, contact their healthcare provider about potential exposure — especially if they are pregnant or have a weakened immune system — and avoid large gatherings if symptoms arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis said, however, that the most effective preventive measure against measles is immunization. “The best way to protect yourself and your family from infection is with the highly effective measles vaccine,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 03:26:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQUEh5SXlrMDM2MVJlb2czaEczY3Z0cnpMb2xHVm5oWlBZV0c5dnVLVnpkZU0xZk1IaDFjUDN0NVZoM0RBcVNRd3FUZlhxcmhiX0R5RURlNmREMkduaGwtLVp1RFhpbEoxOWZCTnl2Z2sxU1hkc1Q2VHc3amxuNTgtaEU0MkpUWEJ5T2xUMTZjWUxfRDJjYWVDbmZSZUhPeTQ0cDh5Wm9DbnJ1T2ZsbmJXWVRXSjhtT185</guid></item><item><title>随着密歇根州药物过量死亡人数下降，这些差异仍然存在-底特律新闻 | As drug overdose deaths decline in Michigan, these disparities persist - The Detroit News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxPRmdXcmVJS2FYM2JwZlNnVFozWXhNaDlJT05nSkxWNV9ZSktYYW1EcmZYVHQxX2J2bGNzMnNHcFhDYlQ1MUZGUGtsSkk2VEdzUzlqNWpiejVDdkMtal9vMlJDdFBnVDNhbXV1eHg1Zm1NTWhSclJKRmJUNUtrbDl3X0ZFS3VUbmNGTExSQXFoMkdRS05fNTUwbGFwWl9ZYlJDcmJrLW1sYWdBLXdUdzJVSy0xLWttY3NRMWlYUFpCMVVtanYyV3VCOVNIWExJWkQzSUdBMWhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="relative pb-5 w-full font-sans text-primary bg-inherit" data-testid="footer"&gt;&lt;p class="relative w-[1200px] max-w-[90vw] border-t border-button-disabled mx-auto mb-[30px]"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="flex flex-col gap-5 items-center max-w-[1200px] px-5 mx-auto md:px-10 lg:px-[50px]"&gt;&lt;p class="flex justify-center items-center w-full text-sm" data-testid="copyright"&gt;&lt;span&gt;© 2025 The Detroit News, a Digital First Media Newspaper.

I have had so many, usually related to diabetics with foot sores- almost always resulting in amputation of a toe (or more).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, my favorite was an elderly farmer who came in with chest pain that, 'Wouldn't go away', as he put it. When we asked him if he had it before had it before- he had said that he had been having chest pain on and off for years, but it would typically go away after he grabbed his electric fence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently, the first time he had the pain- he was standing out near an electric fence on his farm, and he reached out to steady himself and accidentally grabbed the electric fence, which shocked him, and made the pain go away. So after that, whenever he would have the pain, he just went and grabbed the fence and it made him feel better. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He had literally been cardioverting himself for years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was fixed up and sent on his way- but we all still chuckle about it now and then because he was so nonchalant about it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4edn5/" target="_blank"&gt; FlaviusArrianus &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/shallow-focus-photography-of-barb-wire-0vKqq-_6wto" target="_blank"&gt; Marivi Pazos / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-24/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="desktop-in-content-ad post-ads "&gt; &lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt; &lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065588"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065588" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-19-68821f487ddfc__700.jpg" alt="Elderly woman lying in bed alone, illustrating patients delaying help with shocking consequences and serious health risks." title="Elderly woman lying in bed alone, illustrating patients delaying help with shocking consequences and serious health risks."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I’m still just a nursing student, but my professor told us a story of when he was an ER nurse. An elderly 80 something year old woman came in to the ER, and as he assessed her, he noticed her oral temperature was normal despite her neck being extremely hot to the touch. He decided to take a rectal temperature, which ended up being like 103 or something crazy. While he was down there, he noticed something peeking out of her v****a and proceeded to remove it. It was an old sock. She said her uterus had prolapsed months before and she was using the sock to keep it in. They began treating her for TSS immediately but sadly she went septic and died later that day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tongue in cheek, he told us she died of toxic sock syndrome. 😩💀 nurses have to use dark humor to cope.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4roe9/" target="_blank"&gt; pinkawapuhi &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/elderly-caucasian-woman-sleeping-on-the-bed-D5kfGQYAvj8" target="_blank"&gt; Curated Lifestyle / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-81/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065508"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065508" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-2-6881fd5fcbcb4__700.jpg" alt="Female doctor examining an X-ray, highlighting the consequences of patients delaying medical help and treatment." title="Female doctor examining an X-ray, highlighting the consequences of patients delaying medical help and treatment."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;A&amp;amp;E/ED doctor here! &lt;br&gt;A farmer in his 70s reluctantly came in with his wife after falling over outside while wrangling a sheep one WEEK earlier. He did not want to be there but had been “forced” to come by his wife who was worried about him. On questioning/examining he was pale, short of breath, and clearly in pain all over the right side of his chest but not wanting to show it!

He wound up tearing some stitches that were placed and bleeding like a stuck hog all weekend long. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Came into our clinic, blue in the lips and fingers, and her hemoglobin was 4 (normal should be 12 - 15). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She didn't wanna be a bother, so she waited until she started feeling dizzy all the time. She got another trip to the hospital for transfusion and repair for that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But...like I said, this isn't the first time I've seen that, so for the love of God...if homeboy is begging for it after you just had a baby, maybe he needs a lesson in self control and a bottle of moisturizer.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4ksod/" target="_blank"&gt; Ssutuanjoe &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/topless-woman-lying-on-bed-tcrWppXr2Xk" target="_blank"&gt; Greg Pappas / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-28/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065532"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065532" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-11-6882022487013__700.jpg" alt="Close-up of a patient’s knee being bandaged, highlighting delayed help with shocking consequences in medical care." title="Close-up of a patient’s knee being bandaged, highlighting delayed help with shocking consequences in medical care."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Former medic here.

When we came down, we saw that the patient was holding a plastic bag over their abdomen. When this was removed, we found that their wound had opened and their intestine was visible to the air. It transpired that this was not something that had happened over night, it had taken several days. The patient had started using plastic bags and newspaper to dress the wound when they ran out of dressings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: Addendum - because this is getting a lot of views, I must stress that this case was exceptionally uncommon, and an example of what happens when someone does not seek medical attention when it is obviously required. In general, hernia operations are very common and very safe; that being said, if you have any surgical procedure and you are not certain the wound is healing properly, you must seek medical attention.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga3p2r5/" target="_blank"&gt; chewingthefatchungus &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/mature-man-suffering-from-a-stomachache-vMFInKDh790" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-14/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065507"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065507" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-2-6882258d1926d-png__700.jpg" alt="Elderly person covering face, symbolizing patients who delayed help with shocking health consequences." title="Elderly person covering face, symbolizing patients who delayed help with shocking health consequences."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Had a patient brought in by her son who “took care of her,” when she arrived to our unit I performed a skin assessment...took off her socks and found a fallen off gangrenous toe.

It had been progressing over the last several years. But, if she didn’t get diagnosed with breast cancer, then she couldn’t have it. In the other category I’ve seen a few cases of Fournier’s Gangrene. Pretty much obese, male diabetics that had a pimple/sore that started in the pubic region. By the time they come to the hospital it’s a raging infection where the treatment is basically to cut away everything in the pubic/ groin region down to the muscle layer.

I walked into the room to see the patients testicle was bigger then a basketball, two people holding it up to prep it. The guy had a large part of his bowel in his l ft testicle, and his bowel had ruptured due to the pressure. We suctioned poop out of his abdomen for over an hour. Apparently the week before he lifted something heavy and felt a pop. Hadn’t urinated in two days because it was so swollen his p***s was not visible. That’s why he finally came in, he couldn’t pee. Although his testicle had been slowly growing for a week. Unfortunately he didn’t make it, he lived thru 3 abdominal surgeries but sepsis did him in from the ruptured bowel.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4fc1g/" target="_blank"&gt; DynamoRN &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-man-in-a-surgical-gown-holding-up-a-surgical-light-KnSyar6rSUg" target="_blank"&gt; David Trinks / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-69/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065510"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065510" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-1-688225a31380b-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical team performing surgery in an operating room with vital signs monitor showing patient’s heart rate and status." title="Medical team performing surgery in an operating room with vital signs monitor showing patient’s heart rate and status."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Story from my SIL who is a nurse.

About 12 years ago I was asked to look at and give advice on a lady who had a very slow growing tumour on their nose. A Basel cell carcinoma. Usually not much of an issue as if caught early can be cut off with surgery and that's it or a short course of radiotherapy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out this lady was quite vain, and as soon as the lump had started to grow she hid it under a scarf. She ended up hiding it for 20 years. By the time it was seen by any medical professional the tumor had taken over most of her nasal cavity, had crushed 1 eye, deformed her whole face, and grown inbetween all the nerves and blood vessels. It was inoperable and there was very little you could do with radiotherapy without doing alot of damage to everything else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such a shame as it would have been so easy to fix 20 years ago.

He then spent the next week wading through chest-deep swamps, figuring that if he just kept his arm wrapped, he’d be okay. &lt;br&gt;I was like...brother no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: oh yeah, there was also that time some female LT came in with vaginal pain.

So as the story went, his finger got swollen and painful about a week prior. Just got worse and worse, and about 3 days prior to coming, a hole opened up in the tip of his finger (this is where I, personally, would have noped right to the office).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So come the day of the visit, he says, “By the way, I pulled something out of the hole in my finger yesterday with a pair of tweezers, no idea what it is.” I asked him if he took a picture or kept it, and he produced a tissue from his shirt pocket.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was his distal phalanx (read: last bone in the finger). The bone had gotten infected and the body did it’s thing and basically tried to eject what was now a hot foreign body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The guy pulled his fingertip out of his fingertip. A better magic trick, I have not since seen.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4pyqu/" target="_blank"&gt; AN-I-MAL &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-46/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065587"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065587" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-18-68821eeda35c6__700.jpg" alt="Elderly man sitting alone on a bench outdoors, reflecting on delayed help and its shocking consequences." title="Elderly man sitting alone on a bench outdoors, reflecting on delayed help and its shocking consequences."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;ER PA here. The worst I ever saw was a man in his 50’s who was an alcoholic and had anxiety problems who was brought in by his neighbors for a “facial infection”. Turned he had squamous cell skin cancer that made the left side of his face look like the Batman villain two face. The ct of his face and neck revealed that it had spread into his lymph nodes and mandible. The skin on his face was literally sloughing off as I spoke with him and the smell was absolutely horrible (and I smell terrible things all the time). I have never almost vomited in a room except for him just due to the smell. I asked him why he waited and he said he was just terrified of doctors and hospitals and I believe him. He was extremely anxious the entire time he was in our ED. His neighbors were saints, they said they had been trying to get him to the hospital for months but he wouldn’t come in. We transferred him to a tertiary hospital with ENT and cancer specialists. When I checked his chart a few days later they basically said he was terminal.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4eb34/" target="_blank"&gt; Cybariss &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-in-black-jacket-standing-beside-tree-during-daytime-tfdAhNfBwOY" target="_blank"&gt; Vincent NICOLAS / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-80/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065611"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065611" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-20-68821fa975bc4__700.jpg" alt="Patient struggling to fit into tight jeans, illustrating consequences of delayed help and health concerns." title="Patient struggling to fit into tight jeans, illustrating consequences of delayed help and health concerns."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Lady with very poorly controlled diabetes and morbidly obese came in via ED with a gaping hole on her thigh...like so deep you could put you're whole fist through it.

He weighed 140kg, smoked heavily, ate nothing but food from the pie shop, and spent every night in the pub. The cardiologist told him he was basically about to die (true), and was put on five different medications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He stopped drinking altogether, started exercising, quit smoking, ate nothing but salad. He lost 45kg, his diabetes reversed and he stopped some medications, his heart went back to 55% stroke volume (pretty much normal) and most of his HF meds were stopped, his blood pressure dropped to normal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was "the happiest he'd ever been, and not just to be alive". After a couple of false starts, he found himself a decent girlfriend. He still went to the pub for the social aspects, but drank soda-water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was a really decent bloke too, and was quite the inspiration to many people in the small country town where we were living at the time to improve their lives.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5zvuo2/comment/df1q6ur/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"&gt; PennyLisa &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-6/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065516"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065516" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;My Dad is the one that wouldn't go in. He got a sore in the crease on the bottom of his second toe (the one next to the big toe, so it would be the Piggy That Stayed Home) and just kept ignoring it. He would go with his wife to her nail place and have his toe nails trimmed and I think that's where the infection probably got in when they soaked his feet. He blew it off for a couple of weeks until the wife made him see the doc. It's a good thing she did. The infection had gotten into the bone so they had to snip his toe off to the first knuckle to catch it before it went any further. The doc said had he waited any longer, he could have lost the entire foot.

Had a guy come in at the end of the day for chest pain that’s been bothering him “all weekend”. The ED doc ordered a troponin blood test which helps rule in/out heart attacks. If the test runs above 0.03, we consider that a sign for a heart attack and act accordingly. This guy’s very first troponin was 21.00. TWENTY-ONE. The highest we’ve ever had up till then was an 8.00. The guy should’ve been dead ages ago, but he somehow pulled through. Don’t ignore chest pains, people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: Just wanna clarify that the hospital I work for is a tiny a*s, 25 bed, rural community critical care hospital. Definitely not a place with dedicated cardiologists, cath lab, bedside assays, or even a big test menu, period. Bare basics!

This is frustrating because we very rarely have the ability to get a patient in next day, and if they had called the day of or the day after then we definitely could have gotten them seen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BUT my number one "why didn't you come in sooner?!" moment was getting a call from a patient who had broken their forearm *two months ago* and never followed up. I got them scheduled, they no showed their appointment. Rescheduled, they no showed. Second reschedule, they arrive with a very obvious deformity to their arm due to the fracture healing incorrectly. If they had just come in, it wouldn't have been an issue at all.

We can start with a gentleman in his 70s who was diagnosed with diabetes. His doctor had instructed him that it’s important for him to wear socks and supportive shoes throughout the day. So this guy decides that meant “wear the same pair of socks for weeks and never take them off.” He had showered, slept, and carried on in the same pair of socks for weeks. He came to the ER because there was blood oozing through his sock and there was pain under there. Take the sock off, he’s got a diabetic ulcer that had opened and was full of maggots. Not a pretty site. We clarified those instructions pretty quickly.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga42ygj/" target="_blank"&gt; mdm_pomfrey &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-sitting-on-a-bed-with-a-pair-of-socks-wJ4-Mw2NFVg" target="_blank"&gt; Andrej Lišakov / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-25/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065553"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065553" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-14-68821ce56f528__700.jpg" alt="Person in a turquoise shirt holding their stomach, illustrating patients delaying help with shocking health consequences." title="Person in a turquoise shirt holding their stomach, illustrating patients delaying help with shocking health consequences."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;My favorite story (psych NP). I was called to a suburban ER to see a man who said he had a horrible stomach cancer and needed to lose weight in order to get better. He insisted that he'd been diagnosed by a very prominent gastroenterologist with "Barrett's stomach" which isn't even a thing (it's an esophageal problem). I guess I got called in because the story was bizarre and the staff didn't know what to do with him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He eventually disclosed that he'd shot himself in the leg a few days previously and was waiting for gangrene to set in. He believed that the resulting amputation of the leg would allow him to lose the required amount of weight, thus curing his cancer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I excused myself to let the ER staff know that they should probably examine the leg and to call the county psychiatric service, which was protocol at this particular hospital. I'm not sure what ever happened to him but that was a very impressive manifestation of a delusion!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4edvi/" target="_blank"&gt; _perl_ &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-man-holding-his-stomach-with-his-hands-J6g_szOtMF4" target="_blank"&gt; Towfiqu barbhuiya / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-47/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065566"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065566" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;My dad works as a nurse in the ER.

He was happy, chatty and a picture of health from the shoulders up. His belly however looked like he was expecting very soon. This was a shock to both me and the other girl who had taken the usual toys (we had little baskets for each of us to take where needed). We trailed this little guy while he had a multitude of tests and he was extremely brave letting the docs do what they had to. Mum was asked how long it had been going on and she said 3 months. He had a tumour and the surgeons managed to remove it but the poor kid was so embarrassed after surgery because he had saggy skin and stretch marks.

One of the worst things I’ve seen (mostly is because of the smell) is gangrene due to lack of control over diabetes.&lt;br&gt;The call came in as extreme lower limb pain. We pull up on scene. I examine the wound to see a man’s metatarsal exposed (yes, the bone). And maggots were eating the wound. &lt;br&gt;Long history of diabetes, and of course, did not do anything to control it. He eventually had his foot amputated. &lt;br&gt;The smell is something that has stuck with me and probably will forever. Just take care of yourself.

She hadn’t been in for an exam in almost 2 years, so the doctor asked that she come in to be evaluated before a prescription could be given. She refused and called again the next day asking for a prescription. This went on all week. Her calling for pain meds, the doctor asking her to come in to be seen.

My first week went by with the usual stitches and broken bones. My second week around midnight, this very obese woman came in complaining of chest pains. So we rush her back, grab her vitals and do an EKG and blood work. Everything comes backs normal but this woman is still complaing of chest pain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So my supervisor and I ask the lady if we can do a head to toe check up. Now this woman had a rather pungent smell to her when she came in but I've learned to not think of it, as people in the area weren't known for their cleanliness. So we're looking at her chest and I notice that her left breast was reddened and swollen. So I tell her that I'm going to lift up her breast to rule out any skin infections; as I lifted up her breast a wave of noxious stench engulfed the air around me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank the gods for facemasks. As I lifted up her breast even more I could seen what looked my a mass of rotting tissue going into her chest. Now my supervisor ran out of the exam room and proceeded to vomit in the nearest trash can. I looked at the lady and asked her why she didn't come in earlier as it looks like a massive skin infection was raging under her left breast. She replied that she didn't have insurance and that she didn't think it was a huge deal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I called in a few other nurses and the doctor to assist with cleaning the wound. Well as we begone cleaning, one nurse noticed a bit of fur and bone. As we further inspected, we come to find out its a small animal of sorts. So they collect the sample and sent it to pathology. After we removed said animal, we noticed that it had rotted into her chest so much that her ribs could be seen. In the end it ended up being the ladies missing kitten and she spent 4 months in the hospital for massive sepsis and other related issues.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga48lnn/" target="_blank"&gt; Travis123083 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-42/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065568"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065568" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Doctor here, might be a bit late and will probably be buried but had a 65 year old dude who was diagnosed with lymphoma 8 months before we saw him. He lived an hour out of the city and didn't want to drive in for treatment so decided he wouldn't get treated at all and stayed on his little remote place in the country by himself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Essentially, because it didn't get treated, it spread along his skin and his neighbors called an ambulance when popping in on him. &lt;br&gt;It had spread so far that it essentially went from his head to his knees. It had started to invade his eyes and mouth membranes. He couldn't drink and could barely see. His skin had started to slough off and he was so severely dehydrated because he was losing so much excess fluid from his open skin that we had to treat him like a severe burns patient and had plastics involvement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The consultant said if he had received treatment, there was a chance he could have recovered. Instead he died 3 weeks later.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4mxig/" target="_blank"&gt; kaloking &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-61/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065847"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065847" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Nurse here.

The witching hour was upon us and a man came in looking in some discomfort. He had a delicate issue in his nether regions. He was very embarrassed so off we went to a cubicle where he told us that he had fashioned himself a not-made-for-purpose cockring out of a large metal nut. Unfortunately there was no venous return possible and his p*nis had become oedematous (swollen) and painful. He thought (hoped) it might subside but then it started turning blue. By the time we saw it it was extremely swollen and turning black. If he thought he was saving himself embarrassment by waiting, he thought again when we called the fire brigade to bring their large cutting instruments to free his strangulated member.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EDIT: the urologist said he would keep his piece but may suffer functional problems in the future...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8iwvv8/comment/dyvh01w/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"&gt; Xeynobrand &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/doctors-surprised-patients-not-coming-sooner-4/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065536"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065536" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Years ago as a nursing assistant on an oncology floor we had a guy admitted because he had had an erection for several days and had lost the ability to pee. His bladder was close to bursting and his poor junk was... think microwaved hotdog. Really bad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But NONE of that was as interesting as the fact that this guy had untreated skin cancer on his nose for several years that had over time become infected, developed MRSA, and spread across his face. He had no nose, no cheek, and no eye on one side of his face, and was starting to lose his other eye. You could see part of his f*****g skull. I dont know why he chose to leave it untreated and I have no idea how long it took to get that bad, but I will never ever forget the smell and texture of his rotting face. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the upside, we were eventually able to convince him to have reconstructive surgery. He ended up getting a skin graft that covered up his eye, nose and cheek. So, if you ever meet a very grumpy dude with nothing but a mouth and one eye, know that this is way better than the alternative.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4cafr/" target="_blank"&gt; mzladyperson &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-30/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065559"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065559" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Doc here. This is far more common than you'd think. Even in Australia (where healthcare is free) I'd get several instances every week. The general populace is medically illiterate and/or willfully ignorant, especially so when I was working rurally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) A woman with a facial basal cell carcinoma (common and easily treatable skin cancer in the early phases) that she refused to acknowlege until it had eroded half of her face and developed a severe systemic infection that ended up k**ling her. I could see into the back of her nose from the side, one eyeball was being held in place only by muscle (the bony eye socket was completely gone) and she had no cheek on that side. This woman genuinely looked like a zombie. Poor thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Countless folks in their 30's who couldn't feel either of their feet due to permanent nerve damage from uncontrolled type 1 diabetes. It's a tough conversation to have when they ask "Can't you just fix them so I can go back to work?". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Last week. A previously *very* healthy gentleman in his 60s (we're talking several long bike rides every week) who had chest pain, breathlessness and some near faints for a few days. Rocks up to ED after collapsing with a cold right leg and his 'heart damage' markers are through the roof. Straight to theatre to have his coronary arteries stented. 100% blockage of the LAD (aka the Widowmaker), horrendous cardiogenic shock (c**p heart, c**p oxygen delivery to everything else), and since his heart hadn't been pumping properly a **HUGE** clot (static blood clots like mad) in the left ventricle of his heart that was flicking off mini-clots and cutting off the blood supply to half of his organs including an entire leg. Poor dude had clocked up 200km on his bike the previous week.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4ao92/" target="_blank"&gt; Heaps_Flacid &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-52/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065560"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065560" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Last term medical student here. For part of your surgical rotation we had patients selected from the ER to be "student friendly" in regards to the symptoms they were seeing healthcare for. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An elderly man had a lump in hos groin and was then selected to see me. Went in and talked to the patient aswell as examined him. The lump had trumbled him putting on his pants for a couple of months. He hadent shown his wife or no one else. I could instantly see that it wasnt a hernia as suspected, but a giant tumor with several lymphatic metastases, found around 5. T-cell lymfoma it turned out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dont know if he lived or not, as students we dont follow our patients for very long. The thing i'll never forget is the fact that he'd come straight from work, had a badge with his picture on it, and it looked like another person. It was like he was a husk of himself. His face was so skinny.&lt;br&gt;PS: Swedish medstudent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga46a5k/" target="_blank"&gt; me_and_my_rancor &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-53/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065561"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065561" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I’m a nurse, and I am my own “Why didn’t you come in sooner!?” patient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had a sore throat and didn’t think much of it; my daughter had come home from school with strep a few days before. I spiked a temp, and let it ride. My head hurt, and my neck began to get stiff. Now I’m thinking “oh s**t, do I have meningitis??” Fever gets to 104, so I call my own doc and explain the symptoms. They essentially tell me to f**k off until tomorrow morning. I’m like “okay cool, I’ll take Advil and do that.” Well, lo and behold throughout the night my temp spiked higher and higher. I don’t remember much of what happened, but I know at some point my ex husband demanded I call in with my newest temp that was above 105, and they still told me to ride it out at home, so in my brain cooked state I thought “yeah, okay.” Well, thank goodness at one point my ex got fed up and fireman carried me to the car and drove me to the hospital I’d just finished my ER internship at. My temp was still 106 or above, and my HR was a bit much. What I remember most vividly was my shock at my triage rating lol 2/5! That’s what they made possible heart attacks. All the nurses and techs just kept judge shaking their heads at me like “duuuuuddee you know these things!

One day me and my partner got called to a house for the “unable to to ambulated”. This is a common thing we get dispatched to and it usual means someone is too weak to get out of a recliner or out of bed. We expected to go and help this person to their feet and maybe get a refusal, or transport them to the hospital based on an assessment. When we arrived on scene, a cop was there along with a neighbor who told us it was really bad in there. The second I walked through the door of the house, the smell hit me. I have smelled many dead decaying bodies that were not this pungent. We walk into the living room to find a man laying on the floor of his living room saying he could not get up. His legs were wrapped in what appeared to be plastic wrap and plastic bags. You could see the wrappings filled and dripping with brown liquid. The guy said he had started gettin sores on his feet and rather then go to a doctor, he elected to just wrap them up in plastic wrap. I don’t know how long he had been doing this but it had reached a point where he could no longer gather the strength to get up and he was extremely septic. It was HORRIBLE. We carried him out of the house and I was down at the legs and the gangrene juice was dripping all over me. The back of the ambulance smelled like death for days. We dropped him off at the hospital and I went outside and puked. I see nasty s**t every day but this was by far the nastiest. When they took the wrappings off in the ED, the nurses told me both his legs were completely black and rotten up to the knees. They had to amputate both legs up to the hip and they found the gangrene went up into his pelvis so they had to transfer him out for more surgery. I don’t know if he lived but if he had just gone to the doctor when it started he would have probably just found out he had diabetes and been given medication and lived many more years with two functioning legs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4n8x3/" target="_blank"&gt; bored-but-happy &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-76/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065605"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065605" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I'm late to the thread here but have to write this. I'm a 22yr paramedic and I once responded to a cardiac arrest where a police officer had called us after responding to a welfare check where she found a man unresponsive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We worked the guy but it was quite futile. The cop had started CPR after calling it in so we continued for a half hour or so with no response to treatment. Called it after he remained in asystole without a hint of a response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story was that the guy was out mowing his lawn when he began having chest pain. He stopped mowing, went inside, and called his wife who was at work. He told her he wasn't feeling well and wanted her to know. He then sat down in a living room chair, took out a notebook and started journaling his symptoms. The two sentences he wrote that I'll always remember are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"My chest hurts. It's hard to breathe."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I think I'm having a heart attack."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His wife tried calling him back after an hour and couldn't get him on the phone. After another hour she called 911 to request the police do a welfare check. They found him in that living room chair next to his journal, dead as can be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Literally this guy lived a block from our ambulance station. We hadn't had a call all morning until we responded to his house. He died a block away from me and my ambulance. I was just mucking about the station. Had he just called me I could have saved him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don't be this guy. Call 911 for chest pain, folks. I'll come. It's ok.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4xge9/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-97/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065544"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065544" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Nurse here: Had a diabetic who couldn’t afford to fill his oil tank during the winter. He was young too, early 40’s. Any who. Had neuropathy in his feet so couldn’t feel that they were becoming frost bitten. He had also been wearing his winter boots 24/7 for warmth. His sister went to check on him one day after she realized his phone was shut off by. She brought him in because she thought he seemed off. The doc asked me to take his boots off, one of his toes came off with the boot (no joke). He ended up having a below the knee amputation to one leg and a transmetatarsal amputation to the other and on IV antibiotics for weeks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Diabetics, this is why us nurses always preach “check your feet”!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4b3cq/" target="_blank"&gt; realish7 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-38/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065593"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065593" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;PICU nurse here.

A very long story short: she went unresponsive on the way to the hospital after passing out. She went into DIC and when she was allowed to pass she had 10L of blood products that were not hers.

Over the previous month the patient became more and more confused, stopped drinking, and couldn't walk or recognize his family. So his family recognized that this was abnormal, but did nothing. They were concerned for him and tried encouraging him to drink, saying they were happy when he would drink but he had problems holding the glass. Came into the ED finally after becoming unresponsive. Lactate and ammonia throught the roof. GI bleed, suspected esophageal varies. Hgb like 5. Ended up having encephalopathy. He was wrecked up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second patient was in his twenties. I can't remember the specifics as it was 4 years ago and wasn't my patient. But this patient either took Viagra or had some sort of issue and had a erection that lasted 4 DAYS. YES 4 DAYS. His business was super engorged and purple/black even though he was relatively fair. He was too embarrassed to go to the ED. If I remember correctly the poor man ended up getting a partial penectomy and had a lot of complications. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RIP his peen.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4ibw8/" target="_blank"&gt; Chuckapplesauce &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-88/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065636"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065636" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Training as an EMT so not a doctor, but in the ER.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Old guy shuffles in with his girlfriend both mid-fifties. He is holding a “Members Only” jacket in front of his crotch and wobbling in. We take him through triage to the back and get him on the exam table. His scrotum was the size a large watermelon. It hung below his knees and was easily 18” in diameter. Serious hernia issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just a big oblong mass of flesh that had overwhelmed the rest of his nethers. I think every physician in the Hospital came down to consult on it. I mean every one. Cardiologists, ENTs etc. everyone made an excuse to come take a look.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was clearly an issue he had been avoiding for years. The prescribed treatment if I remember properly was to Kevlar reinforce his belly and shove all his intestines back up and in. They were going to transport him to a nearby by hospital for the treatment, but because it was across state lines he refused to go. So he slid off the table pulled his jeans up around his crotch, grabbed his jacket and his girlfriend and shuffled off to the bus stop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s an image you never forgot, closest thing I can relate it to is when Hugh Jackman is trying to carry the fishbowl between his legs in The Prestige”.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8iwvv8/comment/dyvzo37/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"&gt; Rahodess &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9861/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065789"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065789" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;The human capacity to deny the undeniable is amazing.

The patient had been found in a car in a parking lot, unconscious and obviously having trouble breathing. The guy had a huge mass in his right neck, around the size of a grapefruit. His oxygen level was frighteningly low, so the ED docs tried to intubate him. They couldn't pass the tube due to the mass making his airway around the size of a drinking straw. After repeated attempts, they called in the surgeons on call, which consisted of a chief surgical resident and a surgical intern. Those two attempted a bedside crike but also failed due to the neck mass. Finally after calling in other ED docs, they managed to pass a small tube and hook the guy up to a ventilator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I arrive, he's laying on the bed completely unresponsive. He has an ugly, gaping (but relatively shallow) wound in his throat packed with gauze from the failed crike. He has no reflexes at at all. His pupils are fixed and dilated. He isn't breathing on his own, relying entirely on the ventilator. The only thing he has is a pulse. The guy is dead, his heart just doesn't know it yet. We see this all the time... the patient will hold on for a little while until someone (ie family) decides to pull the breathing tube, at which point they'll die. So we get him upstairs to the ICU and I go back to sleep. I wake up an couple hours later and hand my patients, including the guy off to the day team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later that afternoon I wake up again and check up on him. Turns out he woke up around noon. He pulled out his breathing tube on his own. After coughing for a minute or two, he proceeded to loudly cuss out every person within 50 feet, asking why they didn't let him die. Turns out he's had this neck cancer for a while, and just wants to let it k**l him without doing anything about it. He just wanted to peacefully suffocate (??) and be left alone. He got out of bed, signed his AMA paper, and left the hospital. Never saw him again.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5zvuo2/comment/df1u6ru/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"&gt; Dr_Everyone &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9871/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065538"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065538" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not me but my brother is an EMT for a warehouse. He recently had a guy come to his station saying something was wrong with his toe. So he asks him to take off his shoe, which he does. My brother was about to ask him to take off the bandage around his big toe before he realizes that that wasn't a bandage, it was his skin. Apparently, this guy dropped a 20 pound tote on his toe a week earlier and had been showing up at work anyway. They sent him to the doctor; the doctor sent him to the ER. Diagnosis came back as a tissue infection as well as osteomyelitis (a bone infection). But wait, there's more! The guy come back from the ER and tells him that he doesn't want to go through the ER doctor and would rather go through his own insurance. My brother explained to him as best as he could that, as it stood, he was already likely going to lose his toe and if he waited any longer to get it treated, he ran the risk of losing his entire leg. Not sure what happened after that, I just hope he got the point.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga3x2of/" target="_blank"&gt; Axikten &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-32/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065555"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065555" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I had a patient in the ER who struggled with alcoholism.

(I'm a dentist and saw this when I was on call during my hospital residency)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EDIT: To the people who are yelling at me "Yeah, well, insurance! I don't see you paying for it! It's too expensive!" -- I get it. Dental insurance is NOT insurance. It's a discount program you pay for, or it's a benefit from your employer. In this instance, the patient had state medical and dental coverage -- it covered all exams, fillings, and extractions. He still didn't come in until it was really bad. He didn't pay a dime for the care he received. I also worked in my residency seeing 90% medicaid patients. The other 10% were charity cases. I am acutely aware of the problems with cost for dentistry and access to care. Blame the insurance companies, not the dentist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are looking for cheaper dental care, look into dental schools and Federally Qualified Health Centers. The former works at ~50% private practice fees. The latter works on sliding scales. In the meantime, DO WHAT YOU CAN TO PROTECT YOUR TEETH. Dollar store has toothbrushes and toothpaste. Actually use them. A VAST majority of dental problems can be prevented with adequate oral hygiene. Cut out soda from your diet, get rid of energy drinks, don't live off of candy and cookies. Get in at LEAST once a year for an exam.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4bqbg/" target="_blank"&gt; Kliarin &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-60/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065572"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065572" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Had an older female patient come in for abnormal labs secondary to extreme diarrhea.

Pooping." in the mirror.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4euzx/" target="_blank"&gt; RegisteredSloth &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-65/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065608"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065608" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Dental hygienist here. I see a lot of bad cases due to many Americans not having health insurance. I was taking x-rays on a patient once when suddenly one of her lower front teeth fell into her lap!! She hastily picked it up and put it BACK INTO HER JAW. It was only being held in by hardened up plaque and had been for over a year. She had to have all of her teeth extracted do to advanced periodontal disease.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4iy4g/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-100/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065800"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065800" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Just last week I had a guy over 400lbs (BMI 60). He was a hoarder and kept getting cellulitis in his legs because his house was so cluttered he kept hitting his legs into things and getting cuts and infections. When he came in we had to remove his socks with scissors because he hadn’t taken them off in over 3 months, his socks had imbedded into his skin and somehow become one (I didn’t learn in medical school how that happens).&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8iwvv8/comment/dyvy6yy/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9866/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9065592"&gt;  &lt;p id="9065592" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;NAD, German Paramedic. Got a call: Maggots falling out of the shoe.&lt;br&gt;He was a guy with a government supervisor because of mental health, who had worn the same sock for about four weeks, because a little wound dried blood into it. It hurt to try taking it off. &lt;br&gt;After two weeks it seeped into his shoe, so he kept that on too, for the two weeks until we got called. &lt;br&gt;Luckily I had a cold, meaning blocked nose. &lt;br&gt;We didn't do anything, just a trash bag around foot and leg, and off to the hospital. &lt;br&gt;The head nurse took one look at the trashbagged foot and directed us to the operating room. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the gov. Guy had directed him to his normal doc early on, he'd still have both feet.&lt;br&gt;At least my colleague got to tell the gov guy that this was his responsibility, in which he failed, and that spectacular.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ji0m39/doctors_and_nurses_of_reddit_what_have_been_your/ga4atfz/" target="_blank"&gt; Zottel_jenkins &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9856-85/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bored Panda</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 03:01:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFBVRXdObjlkQnloeDY3VkFuTV8xMHpRZWUycTNTcklxTzVxSnl3SjNOWms3bEZzRVROb0lSQVAtc1BhT01kOUg1Mi1taXdLbjdYZGVnazdBbjNYZVZmcE9fLWk5b1c4NXVfX1pYWjlUQS1FRjh2bE82UnZCa3Y</guid></item><item><title>抑郁症补充剂真的有效吗？科学家分析64种热门产品- SciTechDaily | Do Depression Supplements Actually Work?
