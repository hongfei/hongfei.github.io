  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0pqt400063b77tym7fb15@published"&gt;In the past six months, the term “hung smile” has become a growing meme among stan communities as a shorthand for discussing the attractiveness of certain male stars. On &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/survivorcirclejerk/comments/1lb3ofj/that_hung_smile/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TomHolland/comments/1ltx2r2/that_hung_smile/"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ethanforyou/video/7519241110414282039?q=%22hung%20smile%22&amp;amp;t=1751983880792"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@filmaged/video/7503958773132807454?q=%22hung%20smile%22&amp;amp;t=1751983880792"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="https://x.com/legendpoe/status/1937245315188556208"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ghostgabe.bsky.social/post/3lsjmewietk2k"&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, people have described these men as having a “hung smile” to suggest it’s representative of them being well endowed. Of course, they have no way of really knowing—which is why some of the “hung smile” posts &lt;a href="https://x.com/narutopeachs/status/1913966286515675647"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/wildflowertv/status/1938314096962847062"&gt;become&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/_uncle_gworl/status/1872463955127619876"&gt;purposefully&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/emonormie/status/1934117024763924555"&gt;silly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But there’s no clear throughline, and even those posting about “hung smiles” concede it’s just another way for them to say these guys are hot. “It’s used a lot to compliment masculine and buff men, especially male actors, singers, influencers etc.,” said the anonymous person behind the X account @fabbgrat—they went viral earlier in July with a “&lt;a href="https://x.com/fabbgrat/status/1942207363622011281"&gt;hung smile” post&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2025/07/superman-2025-movie-reviews-new-james-gunn.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; star David Corenswet that was favorited more than 58,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0pr2000093b77k3gjdccb@published"&gt;“Hung smile” has existed online for many years, albeit in a different form—a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317173425/https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hung%20smile"&gt;2011 entry&lt;/a&gt; on Urban Dictionary stated it referred at the time to the fond smile a person might demonstrate when recalling the size of their ex-partner’s extraordinarily huge penis. Its current meaning appears to have been popularized late last year thanks to a post about a surprising figure: accused health care CEO killer &lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/12/luigi-mangione-manifesto-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson.html"&gt;Luigi Mangione.&lt;/a&gt; When police released images of a suspect during their manhunt in December, &lt;a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/flick-that-bean-one-night-in-times-square-with-blizzy-mcguire"&gt;Blizzy McGuire&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.papermag.com/blizzy-season"&gt;shit-posting&lt;/a&gt; social media star who gave the world the “&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/christian-girl-autumn-meme-caitlin-convington-emily-gemma"&gt;Christian Girl Autumn” meme&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, proclaimed that the handsome man seen smiling in CCTV footage had “that hung smile.” Their &lt;a href="https://x.com/blizzy_mcguire/status/1864732383859093789"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; has since been seen more than 9.3 million times on X, causing McGuire to ask &lt;a href="https://x.com/blizzy_mcguire/status/1934489278777602121"&gt;six months later&lt;/a&gt; whether she was responsible for the term’s ascendence. (Seems so!)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0pr4y000a3b77scjqzzop@published"&gt;So is it possible for someone’s smile to be an outward reflection of what lies beneath? No, you horny idiots. Well, rather … not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;, explained Justin Dubin, a &lt;a href="https://www.mhs.net/providers/d/dubin-justin"&gt;Florida urologist&lt;/a&gt;, member of the American Urological Association, and co-host of a &lt;a href="https://www.themanuppod.com/"&gt;podcast about men’s health&lt;/a&gt;. Aptly comparing “hung smiles” to “&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/big-dick-energy-bde"&gt;big dick energy&lt;/a&gt;” (a term &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/6/27/17506898/big-dick-energy-explained"&gt;popularized in 2018&lt;/a&gt; thanks to Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande’s relationship), Dubin said that what people may actually be responding to in these men could be a perceived sense of self-confidence that may or may not be connected to penis size. “If you have a perceived larger penis size, you’ll have a more favorable image to yourself,” Dubin said. “Because you’re more confident in yourself, maybe you do have a big dick energy because of the fact you &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; you have a bigger dick.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="163" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0pr7z000b3b77zbaiyxqt@published"&gt;The first step to understanding any of this is appreciating that the relationship between a man and his penis can be extraordinarily personal, and a lot of men don’t like what they see downstairs. As many as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/31/health.medicineandhealth1"&gt;almost half of all guys&lt;/a&gt; may be dissatisfied with their size, even if &lt;a href="https://peplau.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2017/07/Lever_Frederick_Peplau_2006.pdf"&gt;85 percent of their female partners&lt;/a&gt; are more than pleased. (Among gay men, there is &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180909065240/https://www.gmfa.org.uk/fs160-the-penis-issue"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; penis size might matter a touch more, and may determine &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2874247/"&gt;whether they are more likely to top or bottom&lt;/a&gt;). As with most body-image issues, a man’s perception of his penis is often affected by media he may consume. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31107944/"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; interviewing six men who had undergone penile augmentation surgery found they were often influenced by seeing large penises in pornography or hearing jokes about small penises in mainstream media. (Just as an FYI, a &lt;a href="https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bju.13010"&gt;2014 international study&lt;/a&gt; of more than 15,000 penises found an average erect length of 5.16 inches and girth of 4.6 inches.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prb5000c3b77eawaf78f@published"&gt;Crucially, though, whether a man is smaller than average or not, men who &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; they’re on the smaller side are likely to be &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/dissatisfaction-with-penis-size-and-genital-appearance-tied-to-mental-health-issues-in-men/#google_vignette"&gt;less sexually satisfied&lt;/a&gt; and more likely to suffer from &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13685538.2024.2363275#abstract"&gt;anxiety or depression&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, guys who do seem self-assured or happy with their junk may thus naturally radiate big dick energy, whether justifiably or not. That’s in line with the findings of one &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-09081-001"&gt;2006 study&lt;/a&gt; that found men who rated their penises as larger than average also believed themselves to be more attractive overall, suggesting a general confidence boost because of their perceived size.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prdy000d3b77xybjcoxw@published"&gt;One of the study’s authors, David Frederick, who is an associate professor of psychology at California’s Chapman University, presented some unpublished research at the Sexuality Preconference of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology this year. Frederick found that men who reported having larger penises and greater upper-body muscularity were also more confident flirting and pursuing romantic relationships. “Men’s views of their penis size were far more important than their height or weight for identifying which men were more confident hitting on a stranger or asking for their number,” Frederick told me.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prgz000e3b77wubgork2@published"&gt;“There are obviously no studies on whether men with larger penises have more confident smiles, but there are reasons these men might have something to smile about,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prjz000f3b777r1u6b91@published"&gt;Seeking further clarity, I reached out to the first person who came to mind: the &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/girthmaster-onlyfans-creator-adult-star-viral-1235009248/"&gt;Girthmasterr&lt;/a&gt;, the Australian &lt;a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/getting-deep-with-girthmasterr-the-biggest-star-on-onlyfans"&gt;OnlyFans creator&lt;/a&gt; who became &lt;a href="https://x.com/zoneofcarlos/status/1782047063070716223"&gt;virally famous&lt;/a&gt; last year thanks to his 8-inch-long, 7-inch-circumferenced penis. “There’s definitely truth to the big dick smile,” he told me. “It comes from knowing that your dick is big enough to get the job done—you need only the opportunity to prove it. You’re immune to the dick-measuring contest without any effort.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prmx000g3b77lsi83wbk@published"&gt;Truth be told, I didn’t notice anything particularly distinctive about the Girthmasterr’s smile. In &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5hILIrPjTw/?hl=en"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7vPMbgRnKu/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=1"&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt;, he shows his teeth, but in &lt;a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/getting-deep-with-girthmasterr-the-biggest-star-on-onlyfans"&gt;many others he doesn’t&lt;/a&gt;. He just looks sort of … normal, albeit &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBHwHc4T0q5/?hl=en"&gt;confident&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHpqkl6x7nl/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=1"&gt;content&lt;/a&gt;. But the Girthmasterr said the thing that gives him this energy is being free from the mental anguish he believes smaller guys suffer from. “The real confidence of having a big dick comes from knowing how unimportant it is to many women, whereas men that don’t have a big dick will always wonder ‘What if,’ ” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prpw000h3b77fy29zry3@published"&gt;Dubin, the urologist, can understand where the current boom in “hung smile” jokes comes from because he believes it’s very normal to want to speculate about the size of a man’s penis. In the past, people have tried to deduce men’s size by gleaning things from their height, race, hand span, or foot size. However, Dubin said there’s not much scientific data to support any general connection between these features and the penis. He did, however, point to some studies that suggested things like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37305632/"&gt;nose&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a38021905/nose-penis-size-connection-doctor-explains-anthony-youn/"&gt;size&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a38123633/index-finger-penis-size-ratio-tiktok/"&gt;finger length&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17191423/"&gt;butt size&lt;/a&gt; may be connected.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="153" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prtg000i3b77sut7z3ov@published"&gt;If people are drawing connections between a man’s smile and his penis, it may also be because there is evidence that the reverse is true. In 2022, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-022-10000-y"&gt;researchers found&lt;/a&gt; that people shown pictures of different men’s penises made judgments about their personality and handsomeness. Prototypical penises were associated with attractiveness, being good in bed, agreeableness, and openness to experiences. Meanwhile, men with narrower penises were thought to be more neurotic, while those with wider ones were seen as more extroverted and sexually active. “First impressions really, really matter,” New Mexico Highlands University assistant professor of psychology Thomas R. Brooks, one of the researchers behind the study, told me. “When we don’t have a lot of information on somebody when we first meet them or encounter them, whether that’s in person or online, we take what we get and we have what are called heuristics that we use to make shortcut assumptions about people.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prwi000j3b77v3bdljqs@published"&gt;Brooks conceded he hadn’t heard of the “hung smile” term until I contacted him, but believed it could be a phenomenon that warrants further study. He suggested, though, that what might be occurring is a variation of the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/halo-effect.html"&gt;halo effect&lt;/a&gt;, whereby we allow our positive judgment of a person in one area of their life—in this case, their appearance or smile—to color our perception of them in other areas. “If you see a cute dude on social media, and he’s got the ‘hung smile’ and you’re initially attracted to him, then you’re probably going to generalize that good feeling you have to other areas, like that he’s got a great personality, he takes care of his mom, and he probably has a big dick.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0przg000k3b77b4e42oi7@published"&gt;However, it’s also possible that if you’re attracted to a man’s “hung smile,” you could just be attracted to his smile alone. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7854600/"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found that bigger smiles were perceived as more attractive, meaning that you’re probably just projecting other things about that man with a big grin.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0ps2b000l3b7731wsofw8@published"&gt;At the end of the day, Dubin believes the only way to correctly determine the size of a man’s junk is to actually measure it. After all, he would know. “I’ve seen more penises than 99 percent of people, and I have no idea,” he said. “I cannot predict what anyone’s penis size is when they walk into that room.” But even if you’re not a guy who’s packing, Dubin suggested you can simply fake it till you make it: “Believing and acting like you have a big dick, people will think that you &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;do.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. — A South Carolina children's hospital has confirmed a death from a &lt;a href="/article/news/local/brain-eating-amoeba-south-carolina/101-da55c2f0-ec50-4446-9353-d77c6c8fca0f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;brain-eating amoeba&lt;/a&gt; in South Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Public Health sent an email out Tuesday evening saying that the "organism is presumed to have occurred at Lake Murray."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prisma Heath Richland Children's Hospital in Columbia confirmed Tuesday that a patient treated at their facility died from the organism. This announcement came a day after the South Carolina Department of Public Health (SCDPH) confirmed that there was a case of someone contracting the illness, but did not confirm a death. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We send our condolences to the family,” said Dr. Anna Kathryn Burch, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Prisma Health Children's Hospital. “The people here at Prisma Health Children’s Hospital care, and just want you to know that we’re thinking of your family.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prisma Health did not give any additional details regarding the patient, including the person's age and where that person may have come into contact with the amoeba. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba--whose scientific name is Naegleria fowleri--can be found in warm freshwater but occasionally has been detected in tap water. The Centers for Disease Control stresses that infections are extremely rare, with fewer than 10 cases a year in the U.S. However, those cases are usually deadly.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DPH says there have been 167 cases reported nationwide in the past 62 years. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Burch held a media briefing Tuesday where she addressed questions about the amoeba. Here is a summary of some of those response and questions some people may be answering in the wake of this news. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;What is N&lt;em&gt;aegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; is an amoeba that is ubiquitous to any fresh water in the state of South Carolina and honestly in the Southeast in general, Burch said. "So any lake, river, pond, or hot spring that you could come into contact with in South Carolina will have this amoeba in it. It typically lives in the silt at the bottom of lakes and rivers."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The interesting thing is that for most people who come in contact with this type of amoeba, it causes no harm whatsoever. Most of us have been exposed to this amoeba who have been in lakes and rivers and those kind of things. The problem is, is that it's not an issue when we come in contact with it.  Where it becomes a problem is if water with the amoeba forcefully enters the nose is able to cross from the nose into the brain. It cause a syndrome called primary amoeba meningoencephalitis.... which causes the brain to swell. More than 97% of reported U.S. cases have been fatal.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burch adds the amoeba does not exist in salt water, so there is no risk if you're at the beach near the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;How common is this infection?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my career as a pediatric infectious disease physician in South Carolina, I’ve now seen two cases," Burch said "There has only been one reported case in the state this year, and this is that case.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;What can parents do to protect their children?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding forceful entry of water into the nose during activities like diving, tubing, or skiing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching kids to blow out their nose or hold their nose when jumping into water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using nose clips during freshwater activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding digging in shallow, sandy or silty areas, where the amoeba lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, never use untreated tap water for nasal irrigation devices like neti pots. Tap water must be boiled and cooled, or use sterile or distilled water instead.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;Should families avoid swimming in lakes and rivers?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a tough question, especially for those of us raised in the South where freshwater swimming is a summer tradition. The risk increases during extremely hot temperatures. Families should weigh the risks and take precautions like nose clips, avoiding dunking, or choosing to float instead of diving. Pools and splash pads are typically safe because they are chlorinated.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is the risk greater in warmer weather? &lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The risk definitely is increased when it's hotter temperatures, such as when we get these 100 degree days. So if you do happen to go into the water during those times, I think having a discussion with your children about why it's so important to learn how to not get water up the nose, have things like the nose clips out there. Maybe decide not to go on the tube and just float around with floats and those kind of things."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;What’s your advice for concerned parents?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a rare infection—fewer than 10 cases are reported per year in the U.S. But knowing how it spreads and how to reduce risk is the best thing you can do. We shouldn’t be afraid of our lakes and rivers, but we should be informed and cautious. Educate your kids, use nose protection, and make the decision that’s right for your family.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Symptoms usually begin around five days after exposure, but it can range from one to twelve days. It starts with a severe headache, fever, stiff neck, vomiting, and diarrhea. If your child has recently been in freshwater and shows any of those symptoms, it’s critical to tell your healthcare provider.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;Is it found in tap water?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s rare, but there have been isolated cases where &lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; was found in tap water. Chlorinated water should not carry risk, but again, never use tap water for nasal rinsing unless it’s been properly boiled or sterilized.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;Is it difficult to diagnose?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, because it’s so rare, it’s not always top-of-mind for providers. That’s why it’s vital to mention any recent freshwater exposure to your doctor. Knowing that can help guide proper testing and quicker diagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

By analyzing gene activity from healthy and neurodegenerative brain tissue, they pinpointed 453 interventions predicted to reverse cellular aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial animal tests showed improvements in behavior, cognition, and molecular markers of youth in older mice. This breakthrough paves the way for therapies that could protect against neurodegeneration and promote brain health in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging Clock:&lt;/strong&gt; Machine learning tool predicts biological brain cell age using gene data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejuvenation Hits:&lt;/strong&gt; Identified 453 compounds that reverse age-related cell decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof of Concept:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice treated with predicted compounds showed improved memory and younger gene profiles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;CIC bioGUNE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if there was a way to make aging brain cells younger again? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international research team from Spain and Luxembourg recently set out to address this question. After developing an aging clock capable of assessing the biological age of the brain, they used it to identify possible brain-rejuvenating interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computational tool they created, recently presented in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science,&lt;/em&gt; constitutes a valuable resource to find compounds with therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111884"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce.jpg" alt="This shows a clock and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers developed what is called an “aging clock”, a computational tool designed to measure the biological age of cells, as opposed to their chronological age. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world population is aging rapidly, with over two billion people projected to be above the age of 60 by 2050, age-related brain disorders are on the rise. Living longer but in poor health is not only a daunting prospect; it also places a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of being able to counteract the functional decline of our brain through rejuvenating interventions sounds therefore promising. The question is how can we identify compounds that have the potential to efficiently rejuvenate brain cells and to protect the aging population from neurodegeneration? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Antonio Del Sol and his teams of computational biologists, based both at CIC bioGUNE, member of BRTA, and the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB) from the University of Luxembourg, used their machine learning expertise to tackle the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a clock to measure the biological age of the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed what is called an “&lt;em&gt;aging clock&lt;/em&gt;”, a computational tool designed to measure the biological age of cells, as opposed to their chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the organs and tissues of people of the same age can evolve differently over time depending on genetic and environmental factors, leading to different biological ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These clocks are therefore useful tools to assess aging at the molecular level and can help in understanding its causes and consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clock designed by CIC bioGUNE and LCSB researchers is specific to the brain and uses gene expression information from 365 genes to make predictions. Using a machine learning approach, it was trained on data from healthy individuals, aged from 20 to 97, and could accurately predict their age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests showed that the clock is able to estimate the biological age of different cell types in the brain, especially neurons. Lastly, by looking at the predicted biological ages for healthy individuals and for patients with neurological conditions, the researchers observed that patients exhibited a higher biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results tell us that the biological age of the brain cells calculated by our clock reflects the decline in brain function experienced by the patients, especially between 60 and 70, and is even correlated with the degree of neurodegeneration,” explains Dr. Guillem Santamaria, first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It supports the view of neurodegeneration as a form of accelerated aging but, more importantly, the positive association between neurodegeneration and biological age suggests that the rejuvenating interventions identified by the clock could serve as neuroprotective agents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying compounds that have a rejuvenating potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the researchers was to use the clock to find genetic or chemical interventions that would signiﬁcantly shift back the biological age of brain cells. They explored the effect of thousands of compounds on neural progenitor cells and neurons and identified 453 unique rejuvenating interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the identified compounds that have the potential to reverse the biological age of the two types of brain cells, several are known to extend lifespan in animal models and some are already used to treat neurological disorders, but the vast majority has not yet been studied in the context of health- or lifespan extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the one hand, the fact that our computational platform identified drugs that have a known effect on brain function supports the idea that using the predicted effect of a compound on the biological age is an efficient way to evaluate its neuroprotective potential,” details Prof. Antonio Del Sol, Ikerbasque researcher and head of the Computation Biology groups at CIC bioGUNE and LCSB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the other, the results also highlight that our clock can help us find many new candidates that haven’t been studied before for their rejuvenating properties. It opens up a lot of new avenues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First validation in animal model and broadening the therapeutic horizon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a proof of concept of their approach, the researchers then tested three of the predicted compounds in mice, in collaboration with the team of Prof. Rubén Nogueiras at the Centre for Research in Molecular Medicine and Chronic Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration of these drugs signiﬁcantly reduced anxiety and slightly increased spatial memory in older mice, addressing two well-known symptoms associated with aging. An analysis of gene expression showed that the combination of these compounds also led to a shift toward a younger phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these results show that a selection of compounds predicted to rejuvenate the brain did produce rejuvenation at the molecular level in the cortex of aged mice and had an impact on behavioural and cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, the study, recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;, highlights the computational aging clock developed by the researchers as a valuable resource for identifying brain-rejuvenating interventions with therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases. It provides a strong foundation for further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hundreds of compounds predicted by our platform require validation across multiple biological systems to assess their eﬃcacy and safety, oﬀering extensive opportunities for future therapeutic development,” concludes Prof. Antonio Del Sol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurogenesis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b3d9c0d6ddd7c1d2f3d0dad0d1dadcd4c6ddd69dd6c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jana Sendra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cicbiogune.es" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CIC bioGUNE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jana Sendra – CIC bioGUNE&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/advs.202503344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A Machine-Learning Approach Identifies Rejuvenating Interventions in the Human Brain&lt;/a&gt;” by Antonio Del Sol Mesa et al. &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Machine-Learning Approach Identifies Rejuvenating Interventions in the Human Brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in life expectancy has caused a rise in age-related brain disorders. Although brain rejuvenation is a promising strategy to counteract brain functional decline, systematic discovery methods for efficient interventions are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A computational platform based on a transcriptional brain aging clock capable of detecting age- and neurodegeneration-related changes is developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applied to neurodegeneration-positive samples, it reveals that neurodegenerative disease presence and severity significantly increase predicted age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By screening 43840 transcriptional profiles of chemical and genetic perturbations, it identifies 453 unique rejuvenating interventions, several of which are known to extend lifespan in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the identified interventions include drugs already used to treat neurological disorders, Alzheimer’s disease among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of compounds predicted by the platform reduced anxiety, improved memory, and rejuvenated the brain cortex transcriptome in aged mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate the platform’s ability to identify brain-rejuvenating interventions, offering potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 20:52:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE4zMWVTLWU4UVZvVnFhbUdWS3R0YW5lZVZZUl9tOTR3amZoRnExLWp5N2xzYmx3Vm56R1ViQ1p4emN1V1Bxa0tBOU5Hak1RSEM3aFNNdU5sZFF5SFJ1TWwxUzh4Ykx1WHRsblBIRg</guid></item><item><title>科学家增压糖替代品–它开始杀死癌症- SciTechDaily | Scientists Supercharge Sugar Substitute – And It Starts Killing Cancer - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOLTE1eHV2cE5xcERRdjl3Q2JMbmYyXzhPTnZ5dFVPVVNHRkU2X0VZMlJ2UUFmWFVQY01GYU5WUng0ZXFrX0dqWU5zNndSa3h5ckkwUFUyWV90cXVINFkxVDB4SWlSdUlCMHE0ei1yYVVVNG5veXRtN0R4a2o3OXFpMmFuVm5Gc2Z3ZUpkcWY5dTJiVFV1d1k0VHZR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 20:13:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOLTE1eHV2cE5xcERRdjl3Q2JMbmYyXzhPTnZ5dFVPVVNHRkU2X0VZMlJ2UUFmWFVQY01GYU5WUng0ZXFrX0dqWU5zNndSa3h5ckkwUFUyWV90cXVINFkxVDB4SWlSdUlCMHE0ei1yYVVVNG5veXRtN0R4a2o3OXFpMmFuVm5Gc2Z3ZUpkcWY5dTJiVFV1d1k0VHZR</guid></item><item><title>麸质可能被错误地归咎于美国人的胃病- Gizmodo | Gluten Could Be Wrongly Blamed for Americans’ Stomach Troubles - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQYmlEeHp0RXJCbWdsbzJHV0VreFhyTmlIdndOOUxjUDZENnBMT2VrSUhObVFNWmpzNnVkSTVuMHhGRS0tV056VEY5Szc1Z2xYZWtyYk9EYmEzNDJQaDU3RDllRWpVZTFRakczMmE5aEhkdkJrWnJZMjJCeUVnTmZUZ3VXekhZYzlXajhGSFNzQ3JMcDdSenpZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;For many of us, gluten is a dietary villain, capable of causing all sorts of gastrointestinal troubles. Research out this week looks to complicate that narrative, however, finding that people are sometimes wrongly blaming gluten for triggering their symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at McMaster University in Canada conducted the study, a small, randomized trial of IBS patients. People became sicker just as often after eating food containing gluten or wheat as they did after eating food without the ingredient, they found. Gluten is likely safer to eat for those with IBS than commonly thought, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that expectations played a major role in symptom generation and that only some of these patients could benefit from gluten or wheat restriction,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(25)00090-1/abstract"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in The Lancet Gastroenetrology and Hepatology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360016"&gt;IBS&lt;/a&gt; is a complex, chronic, and relatively common condition, estimated to affect between 5 and 10% of the population worldwide (including up to &lt;a href="https://aboutibs.org/what-is-ibs/facts-about-ibs/#:~:text=IBS%20affects%20between%2025%20and%2045%20million%20people%20in%20the%20United%20States."&gt;45 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.). Its symptoms include stomach pain, bloating, and diarrhea or constipation. Unlike the closely named inflammatory bowel disorder, IBS isn’t marked by physical changes or visible damage along the digestive tract, but it can still be a debilitating burden for many, with around 20% of sufferers experiencing severe bouts. The exact causes of IBS remain unclear, though scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs"&gt;speculated&lt;/a&gt; it can arise from a miscommunication between the nerves found in the gut and the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with IBS tend to report having specific triggers that can cause a flare-up of illness, gluten included, and often manage their condition by avoiding these triggers. The researchers behind the new study aimed to better understand gluten’s potential role in IBS, so they recruited over two dozen people with IBS for their randomized, double-blinded trial, all of whom had reported improving after switching to a gluten-free diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At first, the volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three groups. All the groups were first told to eat cereal bars for a week. One group ate bars made with flour containing gluten, the second ate bars made with wheat flour, and the third ate bars made with gluten- and wheat-free flour. Afterward, the volunteers took a break for two weeks. Then they switched to eating the bars they hadn’t eaten yet for another round of testing, a process repeated twice. By the study’s end, all the volunteers had eaten all three kinds of bars, though on different schedules and without knowing which bars they had eaten on a given week.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A total of 28 people completed the trial. A significant percentage of people reported having worsening IBS symptoms after eating gluten or wheat bars, the study showed, but about just as often as they did after eating non-gluten/wheat bars (roughly a third experienced worsening IBS during each of the three conditions). 93% of participants also reported having adverse events after each scenario of bar-eating. Interestingly enough, tests of the participants’ stool found that only a third strictly followed their diets as instructed, with likely many fearing they would get sick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings are based on a very small sample size, so it’s not yet certain that they apply to the general population of people with IBS tied to gluten. There are also, of course, digestive conditions clearly caused by an intolerance to gluten, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220"&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt;. And the researchers aren’t saying gluten can’t sometimes be a genuine trigger for people’s IBS. But they argue that in many cases, people’s negative perception of gluten is causing a nocebo effect, the dark cousin of the placebo effect. In other words, someone’s belief that gluten is bad for them can potentially spark or worsen the IBS symptoms seen after eating it, rather than gluten itself.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers say better communication and follow-up care from doctors are needed for IBS patients, given the findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we need to improve in our clinical management of these patients is to work with them further, not just tell them that gluten is not the trigger and move on. Many of them may benefit from psychological support and guidance to help destigmatize gluten and wheat and reintroduce them safely in their diet,” said senior author Premysl Bercik, a professor at McMaster’s Department of Medicine, in a &lt;a href="https://healthsci.mcmaster.ca/despite-self-perceived-sensitivities-study-finds-gluten-and-wheat-safe-for-many-people-with-ibs/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;That may be easier said than done, though. The researchers note that most patients, upon learning the team’s findings, staunchly refused to entertain the idea of gluten not being a trigger for their IBS symptoms. So it looks like gluten may need a promotional campaign to win back its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because higher temperatures shorten the time it takes for the virus to incubate within the mosquito and become infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, warmer temperatures can enhance mosquito survival and reproduction rates, further amplifying the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maricopa County's chief medical officer Dr Nick Staab said: 'This tragic loss is a reminder that West Nile virus can be serious, especially for older adults and those with existing health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14891111/health-hazards-hospital-summer-vacation.html"&gt;'Monsoon season brings&lt;/a&gt; much-needed rain, but it also creates ideal conditions for mosquitoes to breed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most cases have been recorded in Arizona (17 cases), &lt;span&gt;followed by Louisiana (seven), Oklahoma and Texas (five) and Tennessee (three).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other states with human cases of West Nile virus are California, Alabama, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, North Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, and Virginia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far this year, there have been 51 human cases of West Nile virus in the US, including 24 severe or 'neuroinvasive' cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, there were 748 human cases of the virus recorded, including 515 neuroinvasive cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The worry among experts is that West Nile virus is spreading to new areas, and mosquitoes carrying the virus are being found in previously unaffected regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is partly due to climate change, which is expanding the range of mosquito-borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is currently the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, West Nile virus has been detected in mosquitoes in New York City, but no human cases have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once a person is bitten by an infected mosquito, It generally takes between three and 14 days for the disease to develop. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 80 percent of infected people are asymptomatic (no symptoms), but 20 percent will develop fever, headache, and body aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases - about 1 in 150 - the virus can cause severe complications as it spreads to the brain - like encephalitis or meningitis - which may lead to paralysis, long-term disability, or death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People over the age of 60 are at greater risk for severe illness if they are infected, as are those with with certain medical conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and kidney disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no specific treatment for the virus or vaccine, but &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10941781/Could-monkeypox-West-Nile-Virus.html"&gt;80 percent of cases are mild&lt;/a&gt;, where sufferers may experience flu-like symptoms or rashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more severe cases, patients have reported paralysis and memory loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prospero Rangel, 78, beat cancer but was left relearning how to walk after contracting West Nile virus last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;So far, there have been 51 reported human cases of West Nile virus so far this year across the US.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An MRI scan can now tell how fast you're aging by revealing the physical changes in your brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Those with more fluid and a smaller hippocampus had brains far older than the average 45-year-old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ahmad Hariri, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke, said: 'What's really cool about this is that we've captured how fast people are aging using data collected in midlife and it's helping us predict diagnosis of dementia among people who are much older.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DunedinPACN revealed that people whose brain scans showed faster aging did worse on memory and thinking tests and had more shrinkage in the hippocampus, a key region tied to memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smaller hippocampal volume was linked to faster cognitive decline, while larger ventricle volumes (fluid-filled spaces in the brain) was associated with worse health after middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Faster agers were also more likely to develop health problems like frailty, heart attacks, lung disease, or strokes later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The way we age as we get older is quite distinct from how many times we've traveled around the sun,' Hariri said in a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://today.duke.edu/2025/07/scientists-can-tell-how-fast-youre-aging-single-brain-scan"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study author added that several computer algorithms have been created to serve as so-called 'aging clocks' but these programs typically rely on data from people of all ages, taken at a single point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00897-z"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;, focused on participants at age 45, creating more uniformity in the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A software called FreeSurfer was used to process the brain scans and measure 315 different brain features, including cortical thickness, how thick the outer layer of the brain (the cortex) is. Thinner areas of the cortex might suggest faster aging or wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fast agers were 18 percent more likely to develop chronic diseases, and 40 percent more likely to die sooner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The link between aging of the brain and body are pretty compelling,' Hariri added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The professor added that the connection between Pace of Aging and dementia was just as strong across different racial and economic backgrounds in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, the Dunedin Study included participants who were low-income and non-White, and lived everywhere from Latin America to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It seems to be capturing something that is reflected in all brains,' Hariri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The MRI scans also measured factors like gray-white matter signal intensity ratio, which compares how bright gray matter looks to white matter (the brain's wiring that connects different areas).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A change in this ratio can show differences in brain tissue health, like how well the brain is holding up as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers noted that the size of a person's hippocampus can also shrink with age or from diseases like Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, a smaller hippocampus might signal faster aging or higher dementia risk, especially among people who are only in their 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Ventricles, the fluid-filled spaces in the brain that help cushion it, often get bigger when the brain tissue around them is shrinking - another sign of advanced aging or brain health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dementia was the main threat discovered in faster aging brains, as it increased the risk of cognitive decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Duke team then examined the brain scans of 624 people ranging in age from 52 to 89 who took part in the North American study of risk for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They determined that the fastest agers &lt;span&gt;were 60 percent more likely to develop dementia in their later years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fast agers also began to suffer from memory and thinking issues sooner than those who found to be aging slower.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These slow agers had brains that looked younger and healthier than expected, like having a 30-year-old's brain in a 45-year-old body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Their brains featured a thicker cortex or larger hippocampus and showed fewer signs of wear and tear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They were also less likely to develop chronic diseases, meaning they typically had longer lifespans than the fast agers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the team saw the results, 'our jaws just dropped to the floor,' Hariri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Olive oil, rich in antioxidants and healthy fats, may lower heart disease risk by up to 30%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legume-based pasta is high in fiber and protein, helping lower cholesterol and support heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oats contain fiber and plant sterols that support healthy cholesterol and weight management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your heart pumps over 2,000 gallons of blood per day, delivering oxygen and nutrients to every cell and organ in your body, picking up waste along the way and sending it to be filtered.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Given how important this single organ is, it’s no wonder that keeping your heart healthy is one of the best things you can do for your overall health and well-being. And while &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894073/these-7-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-heart-disease-according-to-the-american-heart-association/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; is the leading cause of death in the U.S., there’s a lot you can do to reduce your risk, starting right in your kitchen.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research shows that heart-healthy eating patterns like the Mediterranean diet and DASH diet can help improve key markers for heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These diets emphasize whole foods that are rich in fiber, healthy fats, antioxidants and plant-based proteins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But you don’t have to overhaul your entire diet or break the bank to start supporting your heart. Keeping just a few simple &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15297/our-top-15-heart-healthy-foods/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy ingredients&lt;/a&gt; in your pantry can make it easier to add important nutrients to your everyday meals and snacks. We asked cardiologists for their must-have pantry staples, and chances are you already have a few of them on your shelf. Here’s what they recommend keeping stocked. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-olive-oil"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Olive Oil &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wondering what oil to grab for roasting vegetables, whisking up marinades and dressings or finishing your pasta, olive oil can be a heart-healthy choice. "I recommend keeping some delicious olive oil close at hand and using it as your primary cooking oil, but also to drizzle it on each of your meals throughout the day," says &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.org/locations/specialty-centers/scripps-shiley-pavilion/scripps-center-for-integrative-medicine" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Elizabeth Epstein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Olive oil&lt;/a&gt; has an extensive history of research supporting its role in improving cardiovascular health. A 2022 meta-analysis of 13 studies with over 865,000 participants found a strong relationship between olive oil consumption and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For every 5-gram (about 1 teaspoon) increase in olive oil per day, they found a 4% decrease in cardiovascular disease risk and all-cause mortality. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The best nutrition evidence we have supports the Mediterranean diet, which has been tested in several randomized controlled trials and shown to reduce heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death by 30 percent," says Epstein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The liberal use of olive oil may be a key part of the puzzle, with its high levels of anti-inflammatory polyphenols, antioxidants and oleic acid. While any olive oil will offer some benefit, extra virgin olive oil is highest in antioxidant and bioactive plant compounds that may offer additional benefits to your heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-legume-based-pasta"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Legume-Based Pasta &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t have to skip pasta, even on a heart-healthy diet. "One food I always keep stocked in my pantry is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7958987/best-legume-pastas/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;legume-based pasta&lt;/a&gt;, such as pasta made from edamame and mung bean, lentils, chickpeas or black beans," says &lt;a href="https://www.daniellebelardomd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Danielle Belardo, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; Pasta made from legumes is typically higher in protein and fiber than wheat pasta, and can be much more filling. When it comes to heart health, eating more beans and bean-based foods is a safe bet. Multiple studies link legume consumption to improvements in lipid profiles and a reduced risk of heart disease, including one study suggesting that adults who eat legumes four times per week have a 22 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease than those who only eat them once each week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is partly due to the high amount of soluble fiber found in legumes, which effectively lowers LDL cholesterol and supports steady blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If eating whole beans several times a week feels like a big leap from where you’re at, legume-based pasta can be a simple and approachable switch. "It’s nutrient-dense, easy to prepare and aligned with the principles of evidence-based heart-healthy eating," says Belardo, who emphasizes legume-based pasta’s positive impact on glycemic control, satiety and overall metabolic health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-oats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Oats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your morning bowl of oatmeal may be doing more for your heart than you realize. Oats are rich in soluble fiber, beta-glucans and anti-inflammatory compounds like phytosterols, all of which help lower cholesterol and support healthy weight management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart-healthy eating doesn’t have to include a total pantry makeover. The foods cardiologists always have in their own pantries include simple staples like olive oil, oats and legume-based pasta. Regularly including these foods in a balanced, overall healthy diet may help lower cholesterol, support a healthy weight and protect your heart well into the future. &lt;br&gt;

On average, the difference in brain aging between men and women was small, about 2.5 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa4933" class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t yet know exactly why, but this fits with other research suggesting that men may be more affected by certain types of stress or health challenges,” Mohammadi-Nejad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e68aa2" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/protect-memory-education-key-new-science-suggests-rcna69400" target="_blank"&gt;Brains shrink as people age&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/obesity-can-cause-changes-brain-similar-alzheimers-study-suggests-rcna66555" target="_blank"&gt;gray matter shrinks prematurely&lt;/a&gt;, it can lead to memory loss or judgment problems, although the pandemic study doesn't show whether people with structural changes will eventually develop cognitive deficits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3c63e0" class="body-graf"&gt;The study wasn’t designed to pinpoint specific causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ff679" class="body-graf"&gt;“But it is likely that the cumulative experience of the pandemic—including psychological stress, social isolation, disruptions in daily life, reduced activity and wellness—contributed to the observed changes,” Mohammadi-Nejad said. “In this sense, the pandemic period itself appears to have left a mark on our brains, even in the absence of infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccfaf3" class="body-graf"&gt;An earlier study on how &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/covid-lockdowns-teen-brains-aged-prematurely-rcna169966" target="_blank"&gt;teenagers' brains were affected by the pandemic &lt;/a&gt;discovered a similar result.  The 2024 research from the University of Washington found that boys’ brains had aged the equivalent of 1.4 years extra during the pandemic, while girls aged an extra 4.2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-391e18" class="body-graf"&gt;In the new study, Mohammadi-Nejad and his team turned to the UK Biobank, a massive database which launched in 2006, to determine whether the pandemic had any impact on people’s brains. The database has been keeping track of anonymous health data from 500,000 volunteers who were recruited between 2006 and 2010, when the participants were between 40 to 69 years old. Thus far, the biobank has collected 100,000 whole body scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a70aa7" class="body-graf"&gt;To develop a baseline model of normal aging, to compare with what might have occurred during the pandemic years, the researchers used imaging data from 15,334 healthy individuals that had been collected prior to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-724c41" class="body-graf"&gt;“We used this large dataset to teach our model what typical, healthy brain ageing looks like across the adult lifespan,” Mohammadi-Nejad explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-15e1dc" class="body-graf"&gt;Next the researchers turned to a group of 996 participants who had two scans, the second taking place on average 2.3 years after the first. Of these participants, 564 had both scans prior to the pandemic, which helped the artificial intelligence learn how the brain changes when there is no pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f875b" class="body-graf"&gt;The other 432 had a second scan after the start of the pandemic, mostly between 2021 and 2022, allowing the researchers to investigate how the pandemic might have affected  brain aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcb5f4" class="body-graf"&gt;Although these second scans were done later in the pandemic, “they reflect brain changes that likely happened during the height of the pandemic, when people experienced the most disruption,” Mohammadi-Nejad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-799bfd" class="body-graf"&gt;Other research has suggested that environmental factors might cause a person’s brain to age prematurely. One study conducted in the Antarctic tied living in relative isolation to brain shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a301c8" class="body-graf"&gt;“The most intriguing finding in this study is that only those who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed any cognitive deficits, despite structural aging,” said Jacqueline Becker, a clinical neuropsychologist and assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “This speaks a little to the effects of the virus itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-419ae2" class="body-graf"&gt;And that may eventually help explain syndromes, such as long Covid and chronic fatigue, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d8d4ec" class="body-graf"&gt;What we don’t know from this study is whether the structural brain changes observed in people who didn’t get Covid will amount to any observable changes in brain function, Becker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-23e516" class="body-graf"&gt;Adam Brickman, a professor of neuropsychology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said the study is a compelling narrative, but “still a hypothesis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-22eadf" class="body-graf"&gt;It doesn’t show whether the accelerated aging seen in people who didn’t get Covid will persist long term, said Brickman, who was not involved with the study&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70e76c" class="body-graf"&gt;If the brain indeed was changed by the pandemic in meaningful ways, then people might counter those changes by doing things that are healthy for the brain, he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a8c84f" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We know that exercise is good for the brain and keeping blood pressure at a healthy level, for example. We know that sleep and social interactions are important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 19:18:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNOUh5VVlkZXdMZEswU3Z2RlZ0UDlIaHc3RWJSSnpzNTdmejBCX0pLeEppWnhCS29GZ1FKSWJ3c2NaejZqRHZVc2I0STlTdXluU1E5Q2Z0cHZrdVNEVEpUaFJBNWQ5dmh4U2pMNkF1VE9zNTJ2U3FwM19sUFp3N1ZzTWFPTEZJMmVYeGdiLVpxY01pR1JBSTlsdi1CSXRKT2PSAVZBVV95cUxPNktOSlliY3dwenByTFc1WHpUVkRaWWFaTE9nd3U0UExTNWJYSEdodjR0TUxHVEdKaXlNd2t4cHdZUXo2bERVczBVV214cXJqNEd3RDZvZw</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员说，在南卡罗来纳州米德兰兹郡确诊的食脑变形虫感染-该州 | Brain-eating amoeba infection confirmed in SC Midlands, health officials say - The State</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5tOU9HRXpBajNhNlhFMmI4NjM1ZWVuTDFVZHo4U29KLWpZOTQwX2k1cUZpdEdUSHItMGVnbFVVRFo1X0ZhUjlVcXRad2w3VzNSekppUWwtREgzc2l5T0ExQWgwclhpSHd20gFoQVVfeXFMUE1IRWZ5azVmS241Q05tQk54cVFKSWtDMzhwal82TzNCR3QxWldpaE9BSEliOE1zYzN2eG1xUDRBYVFyQXBJRmFReFg4eGU3bmROZEMzMG5NNXpZYi1qc0FYTU50S1JkdEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="" class="paper story-body"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div class="lead-item "&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person in the Midlands has died from a brain-eating amoeba. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A patient at the Prisma Health Children’s Hospital in the Midlands recently died from the infection, Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch, a pediatric infectious disease physician at the hospital confirmed. The hospital consulted with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when responding to the case, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Public Health became aware of the case the week of July 7 but noted that the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;Naegleria fowleri amoeba&lt;/a&gt; is not required to be reported to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The agency does not track infections from the amoeba and does not provide information about or comment on individual cases, including the person’s condition,” the department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency did not name the body of water the infection came from or any specific details about the infected individual, citing federal and state privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congaree Riverkeeper Bill Stangler said he was also unable to specify where the infection occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amoeba is common within warm freshwater bodies like lakes and rivers as well as in soil. However, infections are rare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms usually start within a week of infection, and they include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to South Carolina’s &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/insect-or-animal-borne-disease/naegleria-fowleri-ameba" target="_self" rel="Follow"&gt;publich health website&lt;/a&gt;. As the illness develops, confusion, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations can occur. The infection is fatal in 95% of cases, with death occurring between one and 12 days after infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infections from Naegleria fowleri were only reported three times in South Carolina from 2010 to 2022. Across the entire country, there were 40 cases in that time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid infection, the state public health department advises to avoid water activities when the temperature is high and the water level is low, to hold one’s nose shut when jumping into the water and to avoid digging in or stirring up sediment around warm, fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a developing story.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;July 22, 2025 at 2:57 PM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="story-module"&gt;&lt;div class="author-card "&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith’s note:&lt;/strong&gt; NASA just&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href='https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-07-22/html/2025-13789.htm"&amp;gt;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-07-22/html/2025-13789.htm' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;issued a standard paperwork thing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the Federal Register today. It is a note about some questionnaire they want people to fill out egarding special NASA events that they went to. Sounds innocent enough and it is good that NASA would want feedback. Except NASA states that they are only worried about less than 0.01% of the American public and that they are going to spend more than one government employee’s annual hours looking at an expected 650 responses? What about looking into what the rest of the nation thinks about how ‘Great’ NASA is or should be? &lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href="https://nasawatch.com/education/nasas-0-01-outreach-plan/"&gt;more below&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-20173"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The note says &lt;em&gt;“The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is committed to effectively performing the Agency’s communication function in accordance with the Space Act Section 203 (a) (3) to “provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results there of,” and to enhance public understanding of, and participation in, the nation’s space program in accordance with the NASA Strategic Plan. The Space Act of 1958 directs the Agency to expand human knowledge of Earth and space phenomena. Organizing outreach events is one way NASA intends to leverage excitement about the nation’s space program and expand human knowledge of Earth and space phenomena.”&lt;/em&gt; Sounds good to me. Agencies get asked to do this sort of paperwork all the time – for paperwork reasons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then there is the whole data thing. Google just told me that there are ~347,000,000 Americans and that ~138,000,000 of them will file tax returns. Every taxpayer directly or indirectly funds NASA. All of these people fund all of NASA. But how do they benefit from that? Many ways of course – even though NASA Is woefully incapable of explaining that to rank and file citizenry – even after 60 years of trying to do so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is one of those &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-lawful-governance-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-regulatory-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;new Executive Orders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that says that you can get in big trouble if you have regulations that hinder America or whatever. OK, so why is NASA worrying about what the &lt;em&gt;“affected public of 35,300” &lt;/em&gt;(i.e. a tenth of one percent of all Americans) thinks about some fancy NASA space party thing they went to – but not query the 99.98% of Americans who get less or nothing from NASA outreach? And they are only expecting a ~2% response rate from the &lt;em&gt;“affected public”&lt;/em&gt;? And they expect to spend more than one FTE (4,046 hours) figuring out what these 650 thought?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course NASA will argue back (if they bother to respond, that is) that NASA has all kinds of outreach events and they have big social media accounts and lots of news clippings and they won an Emmy etc. But ask NASA for metrics i.e. numbers, data, etc. – that is, how many real, actual people outside of their little space bubble were reached for a certain mission; what that interaction(s) were delivered; how the response is measured; what their media metrics for video and social media are; and how many students were contacted in a school year. Ask for that and you get an email saying something useless in 3 sentences. NASA either does not know or does not care to tell you if they do know.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Better yet, ask NASA for their actual outreach plan – the thing that guides who they reach out to and how they do it – and you get nothing in response. There is no plan. Then ask them about data capture and analysis for all outreach efforts i.e. what grades, schools/universities, zip codes, congressional districts, stated interest topics, geographic areas etc. and they either send you old partial data gibberish or do not repsond. And NASA has no follow-up plan for whatever audiences they do manage to reach, and measure, and understand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NASA does astonishing stuff. No kidding. It sets the standard for all others. On one hand The agency has a global reach that exceeds that of most governments and large corporations. But NASA fails to grasp what that global reach means and the vast soft power opportunity it offers (especially if you want to counter China or someone else). Yes, flashy graphics and pretty pictures get you a momentary media sugar high. But NASA has not a clue how to take all that it has done, build upon it synergistically, and maximize its value to everyone who either pays for it and/or benefits from it. There is no long term plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet NASA Is being pushed to aspire to be “Great Again” or that “NASA Is Back” or it will continue to be great etc. while other nations see the same value to space exploration and are surging ahead, nipping at NASA’s heels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If NASA falls behind it is our own collective fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is committed to effectively performing the Agency’s communication function in accordance with the Space Act Section 203 (a) (3) to “provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results there of,” and to enhance public understanding of, and participation in, the nation’s space program in accordance with the NASA Strategic Plan. The Space Act of 1958 directs the Agency to expand human knowledge of Earth and space phenomena. Organizing outreach events is one way NASA intends to leverage excitement about the nation’s space program and expand human knowledge of Earth and space phenomena. In order to organize effective outreach events and registration opportunities for members of the public, it is necessary to collect information from perspective guests and those that will check-in the guests at events. The NASA Special Events System is a tool to allow invitees to register for and check-in to NASA event opportunities (launch viewing, agency engagements, etc.) in a single location.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II. Methods of Collection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NASA Special Events tool is a web-based application on a Salesforce platform. The intent of using electronic collection techniques is to increase the accuracy of information gathered and to streamline the process for guests and workforce alike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III. Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Title: NASA Special Events.&lt;br&gt;OMB Number: 2700-new.&lt;br&gt;Type of review: New Information Collection.&lt;br&gt;Affected Public: 35,300.&lt;br&gt;Estimated Annual Number of Activities: 15.&lt;br&gt;Estimated Number of Respondents per Activity: 650.&lt;br&gt;Annual Responses: 10,000.&lt;br&gt;Estimated Time per Response: 11 minutes.&lt;br&gt;Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 4,046 hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV. Request for Comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Comments are invited on: (1) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of NASA, including whether the information collected has practical utility; (2) the accuracy of NASA’s estimate of the burden (including hours and cost) of the proposed collection of information; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including automated collection techniques or the use of other forms of information technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized and included in the request for OMB approval of this information collection. They will also become a matter of public record.&lt;/p&gt;

Some scientists have even &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;called inflammation&lt;/a&gt; “the cause of all diseases”. But what actually causes &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/27/the-truth-about-inflammation-all-you-need-to-know-about-2023s-hottest-health-topic-from-causes-to-cures" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and what fights it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In some contexts, inflammation is good. When the body faces an acute threat – say, an ear infection or a sprained ankle, it responds with acute inflammation – an immune system process marked by fever, swelling and pain in the affected area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"global/2025/jul/22/how-to-fight-chronic-inflammation-free","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But in the face of chronic threats – say, from trauma or job stress, acute inflammation can become chronic, and the immune, stress and cardiometabolic responses can become dysregulated. Research links chronic inflammation with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24468642/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;low mood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25123210/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16525580/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cardiovascular risks&lt;/a&gt;, and a range of health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/19/inflammation-depression-mind-body" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;depression and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A growing number of products and routines – like &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/19/what-skincare-experts-do-to-their-skin" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;red light masks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/16/cortisol-face-tiktok-cushings-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;de-puffing regimens&lt;/a&gt; – claim to fight the signs of inflammation. Many nutritional methods have proven to help chronic inflammation, too – such as eating &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8803482/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a vegetable-heavy Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; or more &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30412134/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3914936/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;omega-3-rich fish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/30/inflation-healthy-food-eating-america" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cost &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/18/climate-diet-food-plan" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;access issues&lt;/a&gt; can get in the way of these solutions. Plus, they may not address a major root cause, as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768696/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5476783/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; says chronic stress can induce chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To prevent and manage chronic stress, more health professionals are offering “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/04/prescribed-time-in-nature-linked-to-improvements-in-anxiety-depression-and-blood-pressure" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;social prescriptions&lt;/a&gt;”, or referrals to non-medical, community-based, de-stressing activities. Often, these activities are free or the costs are covered by another party, like an insurer or local non-profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="32a68415-fe99-4f21-bebf-b11936da351f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I tried an anti-inflammatory diet for a week.

But according to Dr Qing Li, professor of clinical medicine at Nippon Medical school in Tokyo, forest bathing can also help support healthy functioning of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, a key player in controlling the stress and inflammation response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Forest environments can promote relaxation and activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the ‘rest and digest’ functions,” says Dr. Li. It can also reduce activity in the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the “fight or flight” responses. By helping to prevent and manage stress, forest bathing can also help prevent and manage chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36328581/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;series of Li’s studies&lt;/a&gt; show that forest bathing can reduce the stress hormones cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline. Other &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33066853/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; similarly finds time in nature can reduce physiological markers of stress, like cortisol, and the perception of stress. One &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/a-20-minute-nature-break-relieves-stress?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found just 20 minutes of nature per day can make a difference in stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="engage-with-art-and-music" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Engage with art and music&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Art can also promote relief from chronic stress. In one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5004743/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, healthy adults who participated in a 45-minute art-making session saw significantly lower levels of cortisol afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Feelings of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/18/truth-about-stress-benefits-of-the-good-kind-exercise-that-makes-it-worse" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;stress are related to a loss of control&lt;/a&gt;, says Dr Girija Kaimal, professor of creative arts therapies at Drexel University, who co-authored the study. Creating art helps us feel like “there’s something we have a sense of agency over” and “lets us take charge of the distress”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study’s participants self-reported that they found art-making relaxing, enjoyable, “freeing from constraints”, and conducive to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/08/what-is-flow-psychology" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt; and self-discovery. “Distraction is a great initial coping mechanism to help us calm down after a stressful event, but art can help us dig deeper – it helps us pay attention to what distressed us, and it’ll help the next time something similar sets us off,” says Kaimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s important to create “the kind of art that speaks to you,” says Kaimal – whether it’s writing, dancing, or drawing – and skill level doesn’t matter. “You want to get into a judgment-free zone where you can play and have fun without consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A growing body of research suggests experiencing art, not just creating it, can also promote inflammation reduction. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31167611/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29779734/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found listening to music, for instance, can reduce blood pressure and cortisol.

This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective because bodily movement was often linked with fighting a predator or fighting for our lives, says Dr. Michael Gleeson, emeritus professor of exercise biochemistry at Loughborough University. “The body puts its survival first,” and temporarily inhibits the inflammatory response so it can use energy more efficiently, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In his co-authored &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nri3041" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, Gleeson suggests exercise not only induces an anti-inflammatory environment in the short-term, but may also reduce visceral fat mass in the long-term. The accumulation of visceral fat can drive and worsen chronic inflammation by promoting development of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and other diseases linked to physical inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other research finds that exercise can significantly reduce production of &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11332-025-01445-3" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pro-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt;, like CRP and IL-6, and increase &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5883991/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;anti-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt;, like IL-10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To reap these and other benefits, the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/337001/9789240014886-eng.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; adults spend at least 150 minutes each week on moderate aerobic activity, like brisk walking and cycling, or 75 minutes on vigorous activity, like running, Zumba or sports. A longitudinal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002561961830538X?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; finds sports involving social interaction – such as tennis, badminton and soccer – are best at promoting health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="support-other-people" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Support other people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Because cooperation with others has historically been essential for survival, our bodies have evolved to respond to the absence of social connections. The &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2013.837379" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;late neuroscientist Dr John Cacioppo&lt;/a&gt; compares this evolutionary response to hunger. Just as hunger signals the absence of energy and nutrients and cues the body to find food, loneliness signals the absence of social connections, and cues us to seek out or repair relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That’s why multiple studies link feelings of loneliness and social isolation to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5130107/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;range of stress responses&lt;/a&gt;, including increased &lt;a href="https://pure.johnshopkins.edu/en/publications/getting-under-the-skin-social-isolation-and-biological-markers-in" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pro-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt; and dysregulated &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19744794/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Conversely, studies link &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15473629/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high levels of social support &lt;/a&gt;to lower cortisol, and link social activities like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4229892/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;volunteering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37036113/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;giving social support&lt;/a&gt; to lower pro-inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="experience-awe" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Experience ‘awe’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within all of these activities, the experience of awe – a feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends our current understanding of the world – can also reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Jennifer Stellar, a professor of psychology at University of Toronto, co-authored a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25603133/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that links awe to greater positive affect and lower inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Further research is underway but Stellar suggests “that positive emotions can undo the effects of negative emotions, and negative emotions are associated with inflammation”. Another reason is that “awe makes us feel connected to others, and social connection has been documented to act as a buffer against inflammatory responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So how can you encounter awe? Her co-author, Dr Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at University of Berkeley California and renowned awe expert, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/02/awe-psychology-life-death-dacher-keltner" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that it can result from engagement with the “eight wonders of life”: the moral beauty of others, nature, collective movement, music, visual design, spirituality and religion, big ideas, and the cycle of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPR3lYaFpRWTRfZnhaUnRhdU9FbExTQXRhN3VKOWR2M2U4YTNjUkdGUzdaREo1U2wzVE5fYURXTUVFelRObGlnOWxaZWJJV1ZDM05tbFpBRXdnQ1IzZkxaM2lCbTJOeUN5RzF4aFNINVpMVmU1cEZJS0xJNGR5R1ZJQWdpWHg1TWg4TUhHc2lR</guid></item><item><title>性建议：我看到的那个男人在床上解放了我。现在，这将是我们的垮台。- Slate Magazine | Sex advice: The man I'm seeing liberated me in bed.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rr6h00173b775qxm39ky@published"&gt;I am a voracious reader of your column. I love the content, advice, and inspiration it provides me. I am writing in for help with a problem I am having. My rational side knows the answer, but my emotional side will not get with the program.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rr8f00183b77f93x85fd@published"&gt;I am female and my partner is male. We began our relationship hot and heavy. He reawakened in me a connection with my sexual self that has been powerful and liberating. I am in my mid-40s, perimenopausal, and still I WANT to have sex as often as possible because of how good it feels to be desired and connected to a man that I love.  We have been very adventurous. I have a vivid imagination and fantasize and masturbate regularly. I always prefer him. Here is the problem…&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rram00193b77dm16bz7w@published"&gt;His libido is vanishing. He is also in his 40s. He has an incredibly stressful job, custody troubles, substance abuse, and past sexual trauma. He is a complicated, yet simple man, and we love each other very much. I communicate endlessly about his diminishing initiative to be intimate and how it makes me feel. This then turns into him feeling guilt and shame for not being able to provide what I need, and he worries I will leave him for someone who can.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="201" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd9mgfku000b3b7820xbz79a@published"&gt;He is finally taking erectile dysfunction medication, but he seems to never be in the mood to initiate. I feel like I am badgering him. I know he is tired and stressed, but he is so sexy to me that I want him ALL the time, and the pressure I put on him only makes it worse. I try to tell him that I don’t need his penis to work for me to be sexually satisfied. I just need him to want me the way he used to. He says he will go to therapy with me, but not alone. We talk about our relationship issues, but he is exhausted by the fact that it always comes back to sex and my constant need for it. Non-monogamy is not really for us (although we have discussed my fantasy of bringing another male to the bedroom). I know I need to back off and give him some grace. It is his body, and I need to learn how to be patient. Still, my feelings of rejection and neglect are overwhelming sometimes. How can I reconcile my understanding of what he is physically/mentally going through with my overwhelming feelings of hurt and frustration?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrja001c3b77y2vef73g@published"&gt;As a longtime reader, I’m guessing you’re aware of my philosophy that feelings can’t be forced—whether that’s you feeling satisfied, or your partner feeling desire. He probably does want, on some level, to want you the way he used to. You’re absolutely correct that patience, space, and grace are the best way to create conditions that are conducive to your partner feeling desire toward you. You know that men often deal with feelings of inadequacy around erectile dysfunction, and may have a hard time with their libido being lower than they feel it should be or than it used to be. And you’re aware that most of us worry, at some point, about whether our partners might leave us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrlx001d3b77zlzk5vhc@published"&gt;As an aside, absolutely do not pursue bringing in a third partner at this time. It’s too combustible. Even discussing the fantasy has a chance of adding more shame and pressure to what your partner is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rroa001e3b77u6nmbhpe@published"&gt;Are you sure that the neglect you’re feeling is entirely related to sex? Your partner is juggling a lot, and I’m wondering whether you’ve perhaps enjoyed the sexual liberation you describe so thoroughly that you may not have noticed intimacy, connection, and support being somewhat absent in other areas. So take a long, sober look at the relationship. Do you get the amount of touch you need outside of sex? Is he emotionally available to a degree that is sufficient for you? Do you have ways of connecting outside of physical intimacy?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrqc001f3b77tl8l28dj@published"&gt;If everything else is healthy and happy, what can you do to increase the sexual gratification you get from your solo time? Sometimes this looks like adding props and media—a new vibrator, some different fantasies—and sometimes this looks like a kind of mindful minimalism. Whatever you’re doing right now, explore other directions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrsk001g3b77h73b4v38@published"&gt;As for reconciling what your mind knows with what you feel and what your body wants, therapy is absolutely an option. It may help to simply accept the fact that we sometimes have to hold disparate perspectives. Talking it out with trusted friends is another time-tested way of dealing with difficult feelings. Have a commiseration session—whether you’re all navigating similar hiccups or having different challenges, a group complaint night has a way of helping contextualize what we’re going through.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrup001h3b7790eqxj9n@published"&gt;Lastly—and I know this is a wild thing for a sex advice columnist to say to someone who is fairly freshly sexually liberated—it might help to rein in your libido. What can you do to focus on other aspects of life? Or to sit with arousal and desire without letting it run free? This might give you the reprieve you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7w001s3b77y7zbqgqi@published"&gt;I am a 25-year-old woman who is into being a dom, as it serves as a major turn-on for me. The trouble is that I find that many (if not all) of the guys I go out with are decidedly not keen on the idea of playing the role of a sub. Am I going to have to restrict myself to circles with men who are into being subs if I want to satisfy my kink? Or should I try to see if I can convince someone who isn’t really into it to go along?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7w001v3b77w35kn115@published"&gt;Take a moment to look at your last question: ”convince someone who isn’t really into it.” That’s always a dodgy proposition when we’re talking about sex, and doubly so when the sex involves power exchange, restraint, or pain. Your potential lovers are people who deserve respect, autonomy, and care. Functional BDSM absolutely requires that the submissive’s boundaries and rights be respected—if that isn’t the case, it’s assault or coercion at best, and rape at worst.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="157" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7x001w3b77w417lqpc@published"&gt;When you question whether you’ll have to restrict yourself to circles of men who identify as subs, I imagine you’re wondering whether BDSM clubs and FetLife are your only dating options. While you’ll certainly have a more efficient time finding men who are open to submitting in those spaces, there are other avenues open to you. It’ll help to define what being a dom means to you, and what you’re looking for in a sub. Is this more about psychological role play? Service? Are sadism and masochism part of the equation? What do you need out of the experience to feel satisfied? Let’s say it’s about service—is a defined scenario important? Or will someone whose love language is “acts of service” and loves letting you sit on their face suffice? And does any dynamic need to be pervasive throughout the relationship, present in every sexual and flirtation interaction, or can it be confined to specific sexual moments?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7z001x3b77rszlzfv3@published"&gt;Once you’ve got the clarity outlined above, you might look in places like Feeld, which tend to attract people who are, broadly speaking, sexually open. Or attend local events that are marketed as “sex positive” and meet people there. Negotiating relationships with a power dynamic is complex, which is why you’ll need details about exactly what you need to be fulfilled. Be prepared for lots of folks to say, “No, thank you.” That’s part of the reality of dating, whether the detail we’re navigating is a sexual interest, a personality quirk, or the demands of any number of careers. And, if it turns out that your interests are precise and narrow enough that you do essentially need to focus your search in classic BDSM spaces, ask yourself why that feels like confinement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94tayb00283b77zpp7uopi@published"&gt;My boyfriend of three months, “Alex,” refuses to go down on me.  He says it’s nothing personal; he’s just never been into performing oral sex. Getting eaten out is one of my favorite bedroom activities. Should I try to convince Alex to give it a chance, or is this my cue to walk away?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94tayc002b3b77slzkvbj8@published"&gt;It’s worth making it clear to Alex that you’re willing to walk away over this, but I’d stop short of anything that might feel wheedling or manipulative. State the situation plainly: Receiving oral sex is important to your satisfaction, you won’t stay in a relationship where it isn’t part of the sex, and you’re hoping that he’ll be willing to give it a try with you, even though you know he’s never enjoyed it before. Whatever his answer is, accept that and make your choices accordingly with as little turmoil as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol takes around 24 hours to completely leave your body, so you may start noticing improvements after just one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol makes you need to urinate more often, causing dehydration. But your body can absorb a glass of water almost immediately, so once alcohol is out of your system, alcohol dehydration is reduced, improving digestion, brain function and energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol also reduces the liver's ability to regulate blood sugar. Once alcohol leaves the system, blood sugar begins to normalize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you are a daily drinker you may feel a bit worse to start with while your body adjusts to not having alcohol in its system all the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You may initially notice disrupted sleep, mood changes, sweating or tremors. Most symptoms usually resolve in about a week without alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After one week &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even though alcohol can make you feel sleepy at first, it disrupts your sleep cycle. By the end of an alcohol-free week, you may notice you are more energetic in the mornings as a result of getting better quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the body's filter, the liver does much of the heavy lifting in processing alcohol and can be easily damaged even with moderate drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver is important for cleaning blood, processing nutrients and producing bile that helps with digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it can also regenerate quickly. If you have only mild damage in the liver, seven days may be enough to reduce liver fat and heal mild scarring and tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even small amounts of alcohol can impair brain functioning. So quitting can help improve brain health within a few days in light to moderate drinkers and within a month even for very heavy dependent drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After one month &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can make managing mood harder and worsen symptoms of anxiety and depression. After a few weeks, most people start to feel better. Even very heavy drinkers report better mood after one to two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As your sleep and mood improve you may also notice more energy and greater wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a month of abstinence regular drinkers also report feeling more confident about making changes to how they drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You may lose weight and body fat. Alcohol can trigger hunger reward systems, making us overeat or choose less healthy foods when drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even your skin will thank you. Alcohol can make you look older through dehydration and inflammation, which can be reversed when you quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol irritates the gut and disrupts normal stomach functioning, causing bloating, indigestion, heartburn and diarrhea. These symptoms usually start to resolve within four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One month of abstinence, insulin resistance – which can lead to high blood sugar – significantly reduces by 25 percent. Blood pressure also reduces (by six percent) and cancer-related growth factors declines, lowering your risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It can take up to three days for the body to return to normal functioning following a two-day boozy drinking session, experts say&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After six months &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver starts to repair within weeks. For moderate drinkers, damage to your liver could be fully reversed by six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point, even heavy drinkers may notice they're better at fighting infections and feel healthier overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After one year or more &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol contributes to or causes a large number of chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and seven different types of cancer, as well as mental health issues. All of these risks can be reduced by quitting or cutting back on alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol increases blood pressure. High blood pressure (hypertension) is the top risk factor for death in the world. A small 2mmHg increase in blood pressure above the normal range (120mmHG) increases death from stroke by 10 percent and from coronary artery disease by seven percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cutting back on alcohol to less than two drinks a day can reduce blood pressure significantly, reducing risk of stroke and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reducing blood pressure also reduces risk of kidney disease, eye problems and even erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With sustained abstinence, your risk of getting any type of cancer drops. One study looked at cancer risk for more than 4 million adults over three to seven years and found the risk of alcohol-related cancer dropped by 4 percent, even for light drinkers who quit. Reducing from heavy to moderate drinking reduced alcohol-related cancer risk by nine percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;This article is adapted from The Conversation, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to sharing the knowledge of experts.

Drinking at your current level puts you at risk of developing problems with your health and life in general, such as work and relationships. Consider cutting down (see below for tips).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;16-19:&lt;/span&gt; Higher risk of complications from alcohol. Cutting back on your own may be difficult at this level, as you may be dependent, so you may need professional help from your GP and/or a counsellor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;20 and over:&lt;/span&gt; Possible dependence. Your drinking is already causing you problems, and you could very well be dependent. You should definitely consider stopping gradually or at least reduce your drinking. You should seek professional help to ascertain the level of your dependence and the safest way to withdraw from alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe dependence may need medically assisted withdrawal, or detox, in a hospital or a specialist clinic. This is due to the likelihood of severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms in the first 48 hours needing specialist treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Tests confirmed she had a UTI and her doctor prescribed her an antibiotic called Ciprofloxacin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Before I took the antibiotic, I asked if there was anything I needed to know or be aware of since I didn't take medications and antibiotics often,' Talia explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The response was that there was nothing I needed to be aware of, it was "safe and effective" and that the medication was frequently prescribed at the practice to treat UTIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I trusted my doctor of 10 years so I started my course of treatment.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said the medicine left her in excruciating pain for months, describing it as feeling like 'electrical shocks' were running through her body and 'bugs were crawling' all over her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It also affected her vision and hearing, resulted in her having severe stomach issues, and ultimately left her unable to walk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talia explained that after her third dose she began to develop 'pain in her entire body, especially her legs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It felt like I had the flu, when you're whole body hurts, except I wasn't actually sick,' she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As the day went on, it continued to worsen and I started having tingling and numbness in my extremities. I had zapping pains in my head and face. It was like electrical shocks.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It got so bad that she couldn't walk - 'It was like a bomb went off in my body' - so she decided to go to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After describing her symptoms, the first thing the ER doctor asked her was, 'Are you taking Ciprofloxacin?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ER doctor then explained that the drug she was on had something known as a black box warning from the FDA - the strongest warning the FDA could give, usually for a 'serious or potentially fatal' side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back in 2016, according to the FDA website, the organization 'advised that the serious side effects associated with fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs [like Ciprofloxacin] generally outweigh the benefits for patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'An FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones when used systemically are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects that can occur together,' its website &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-advises-restricting-fluoroquinolone-antibiotic-use-certain"&gt;reads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Within five months her condition had become so bad she could hardly eat, and she lost over 50 percent of her body weight, weighing a mere 60 pounds before she was put on hospice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It got so bad that she believed she was going to die after doctors warned that her organs would start failing soon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These side effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reaction to the medicine has become known as fluoroquinolone toxicity - according to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/quinolone-antibiotics/fluoroquinolone-toxicity?srsltid=AfmBOoqywth-1awJHeX73SQSIQA2mf_fzeqbwayaDRkswRfUyPgFRoxv"&gt;GoodRx&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms include 'muscle or joint pain and tendonitis/tendon rupture, nerve damage and twitching, anxiety, depression, hallucinations and memory problems, eye pain, vision loss, ringing in your ears, hearing loss, and loss of smell, and chest pain or skipping heartbeats, known as palpitations.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In response to the fluoroquinolone toxicity, Talia then developed something called mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), which is 'an inappropriate activation of the immune system where the body rejects everything, as a form of protection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in the months that followed, she said her condition only 'worsened.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was having electrical shocks 24/7, it felt like I had bugs crawling all over my body, horrendous bone and joint pain, debilitating neuropathy, vision and hearing changes, stomach problems, my body was stiffening up, and I was unable to bend in order to sit down,' she shared. 'It felt like my body was in shut down mode.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The biggest problem she faced was difficulty swallowing, which made it extremely hard for her to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, she was told by doctors that she would go into organ failure soon because of lack of food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Within five months, I lost over 50 percent of my body weight and went on Hospice, weighing 60 pounds in September 2021,' she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While she has thankfully improved since then, she still requires 24/7 care and is bed-bound - and she doesn't think she'll ever get her old life back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Flash forward to now, four years after the ordeal first started, and Talia is still living with the effects of the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Before and after: 'I still require 24/7 care for my survival, as I am bed-bound and mainly get up only to go to doctor's appointments in a wheelchair,' she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She started to believe she was going to die, and even had a priest come to her house and read her her last rites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I truly believed that was the end for me and made peace with it after five months of horrendous suffering,' she said, as she broke down in tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This was so traumatic for me, listening to my family and friends crying and thinking that would be the last time I ever saw them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Talia's husband wasn't ready to give up, and he 'made it his mission' to get her medication for her MCAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hospitals had previously denied her request but he kept pushing, and eventually, they gave her mast cell stabilizers, which changed everything for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It gave her the ability to eat again, and by May 2022, she was able to leave Hospice and switch to palliative care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flash forward to now, four years after the ordeal first started, and Talia is still living with the effects of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am still on palliative care to this day and require 24/7 care for my survival, as I am bed-bound and mainly get up only to go to doctor's appointments in a wheelchair,' she said. 'I can't do anything by myself. I don't have the strength.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she's still in 'constant pain' and she doesn't think she will ever get back to the way she was before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This has destroyed [me]. &lt;span&gt;I lost my career, my independence, my quality of life,' she confessed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I can only eat five foods because of MCAS, I can't go out and live a "normal" life like everyone else. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I miss working, I miss being able to eat whatever I want, I miss being able to workout, I miss driving, I miss my social life and the life I had with my husband. And there is nothing I can do to get my old life back.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talia said she later confronted her doctor about prescribing her the dangerous medication, but claimed was brushed off - and looking back, she feels like the medical system failed her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I confronted [my doctor] about the black box warning, the permanent and disabling side effects and how fluoroquinolones should be used as last resort, she told me she was going to continue to prescribe Cipro because she always had and no one else had had a reaction like me,' she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She is now on a mission to share her story in the hopes that it can stop others from making the same mistake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She has launched a petition for the FDA 'to issue informed consent for all fluoroquinolone antibiotic prescriptions,' which has over 3,000 signatures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not only did she have a duty to warn me about this dangerous class of antibiotics, but when I asked if there was anything I needed to know, I was told no. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Additionally, the way she reacted afterwards, by telling me she was going to prescribe Cipro for a UTIs, despite the FDA warnings that I printed and brought to her office, was extremely unprofessional and shows her lack of caring about what happened. I felt very betrayed and abandoned by the medical system.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talia is currently raising money on her &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-talias-fight-for-health-and-hope"&gt;GoFundMe &lt;/a&gt;page to help cover her medical costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now on a mission to share her story in the hopes that it can stop others from making the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has also launched a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.change.org/p/request-us-fda-to-issue-informed-consent-for-all-fluoroquinolone-antibiotic-prescriptions?utm_medium=custom_url&amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;recruited_by_id=f927e270-521b-11ef-b65c-8d5e1d4f435f"&gt;petition &lt;/a&gt;for the FDA 'to issue informed consent for all fluoroquinolone antibiotic prescriptions,' which has over 3,000 signatures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concluded, 'If you are prescribed a fluoroquinolone antibiotic as first line, ask for an alternative, if there is one.

collected samples from the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana, a plant native to tropical and subtropical South America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plant is used to make the sugar substitute Stevia, which can be 50 to 300 times sweeter than sugar and has no calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After fermenting the leaves with Lactobacillus plantarum — the same bacteria used in yogurt and fermented vegetables — the team found fermented Stevia proved effective at killing pancreatic &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-a313a6b0-667b-11f0-93ae-09643ae30151"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to non-fermented Stevia, fermented varieties (FSLE) destroyed more cells of pancreatic cancer, which kills eight in 10 Americans affected within five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also left healthy cells virtually untouched and neutralized free radicals, which cause harmful inflammation throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Artificial sweeteners like Stevia have long been under fire for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14798029/popular-health-snack-linked-risk-strokes-heart-attacks.html"&gt;being linked to health issues&lt;/a&gt; like strokes, heart disease and some forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the science on sugar substitutes and alternatives is murky, while decades of research does show the harms of traditional sugar are much clearer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A study shows the sweetener Stevia may help stave off pancreatic cancer (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said the findings could eventually turn the tide for pancreatic cancer, which is on the rise and most often only detected after it has spread throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Narandalai Danshiitsoodol, study co-author and associate professor in the Department of Probiotic Science for Preventive Medicine at Hiroshima University, said: 'Globally, the incidence and mortality rates of pancreatic cancer continue to rise, with a five-year survival rate of less than 10 percent.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, approximately 67,440 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer each year, and about 51,980 people die from it, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic cancer is highly invasive and prone to metastasis, meaning it more commonly breaks away from the primary tumor and spreads throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It shows significant resistance to existing treatments, such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, thus the need for anti-cancer compounds was sought after in less conventional methods like medicinal plants.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That’s where Stevia and fermentation comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the International &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/9/4186"&gt;Journal of Molecular Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, researchers fermented Stevia leaf extract and compared it to unfermented extract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The technique is called microbial biotransformation, which has emerged as a valuable technique for improving the efficacy of natural plant extracts. It involves the use of microbial enzymes - bacteria and yeast, for example - to modify bioactive compounds and enhance their potency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stevia turned out to be most potent when fermented for 72 hours, without oxygen, at 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) - the body's natural, healthy temperature. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found Stevia killed pancreatic cancer (PANC-1) cells more efficiently than the non-fermented extract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, it barely touched healthy HEK-293 (healthy) cells, even at high doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The extract also slowed cancer cell growth and made them lose shape, preventing them from sticking together and spreading.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, fermented stevia proved to be a potent antioxidant. Cancer arises from oxidative stress, which damages cells and DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In lab tests the Stevia extract neutralized free radicals more effectively than non fermented varieties, eradicating 94 percent of them in one test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The chart shows survival rates for pancreatic cancer, per the National Cancer Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fermentation likely created new compounds. The researchers suspect chlorogenic acid that is in the original stevia transformed into chlorogenic acid methyl ester (CAME), a more active form. The raw extract had none of this, by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought that CAME shut down cancer cells by blocking their cell cycle and making them commit apoptosis, molecular steps that lead to its death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Danshiitsoodol said: 'This microbial transformation was likely due to specific enzymes in the bacteria strain used.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Hiroshima University team plans to study FSLE in mouse models next, which will help determine how well CAME works in a living system and identify safe, effective doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time this could potentially lead to a natural and easy way to combat one of the world's deadliest cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/bangladesh-and-india-alert-who-about-new-h5n1-infections" target="_blank"&gt;Bangladesh and India report more H5N1 infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Bangladesh's case,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigation revealed the child had contact with backyard poultry before symptoms began. No other cases were detected, and the child has recovered. The illness marks Bangladesh’s 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;human H5N1 case since 2008 and its third of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, the WHO noted the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/bangladesh-notifies-who-2-recent-human-h5n1-avian-flu-infections" target="_blank"&gt;two cases reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, both of them children from Khulna division in the southwestern part of the country. Both recovered from their infections. Today’s report on the new cases didn’t note the clade, but the two cases reported earlier this year involved the older 2.3.2.1a, known to circulate in birds and poultry in Bangladesh and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India's case was a grown man, who died of his infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avian flu in cows is &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/avian-flu-exacts-heavy-financial-toll-dairy-industry-report-says" target="_blank"&gt;A major financial burden.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I did not know this about cow behavior.  Adult cows sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/flies-milk-snatching-among-h5n1-transmission-contributors-dairy-cattle" target="_blank"&gt;suckle on each other&lt;/a&gt;, and this is believed to contribute to intraherd transmission of avian flu.  But the study also implicates FLIES, and this is not a happy-making thing, at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even LESS happy-making: &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/plague/report-describes-offseason-plague-case-transmitted-cat" target="_blank"&gt;A cat transmitted plague to its owner.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms" target="_blank"&gt;Poliovirus has been found in 20 Pakistani districts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mississippi has &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/pertussis/mississippi-warns-steep-increase-pertussis-cases" target="_blank"&gt;a steep increase in pertussis cases.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Precisely because tetanus is NOT a transmissible disease, not a public health hazard, but is a deadly hazard that lurks in the environment anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

While these rhythms have long been thought of as stable traits, studies reveal that metabolic state, like fasting before sleep, can enhance their timing and co-occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting in rats boosted the density and synchronization of these sleep rhythms, aligning them for better memory consolidation. These findings suggest sleep’s memory-supporting architecture is more flexible — and modifiable — than previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SO-Spindle Coupling:&lt;/strong&gt; Slow oscillations and sleep spindles work in precise timing to stabilize memories during NREM sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Fasting before sleep increased SO and spindle density and improved their coupling in rats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trait and State:&lt;/strong&gt; While sleep rhythms have stable baseline patterns, they can adapt to metabolic and experiential states.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For decades, scientists have marveled at sleep’s mysterious power to strengthen our memories. The human brain, it seems, does some of its most important work while we’re unconscious: replaying, refining, and reinforcing the day’s experiences so they can be stored for the long term. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part of this process involves two distinct patterns of brain activity unique to non-REM (NREM) sleep: slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111846"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc.jpg" alt="This shows a fork and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Future research is now needed to uncover the exact circuit-level mechanisms and to explore whether interventions like diet, neuromodulation, or targeted memory reactivation could enhance SO-spindle coupling in meaningful ways. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These electrical rhythms—large, slow waves paired with rapid, waxing-and-waning bursts—are thought to synchronize widespread brain regions and promote synaptic plasticity, the foundation of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, research has zeroed in on a crucial detail: it’s not just the presence of SOs and &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/sleep-spindle-brain-health-28325/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;spindles&lt;/a&gt; that matters, but the precise way they are timed together. This SO-spindle coupling, researchers argue, may be one of sleep’s most essential mechanisms for consolidating memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is this coupling a fixed feature of an individual’s sleep, like a fingerprint? Or is it flexible—capable of adjusting to recent experiences, such as what you’ve learned that day or even what you’ve eaten? A growing body of work is beginning to suggest the answer is more nuanced than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Rhythm of Memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/nrem-sleep-cognition-28118/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NREM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, your brain cycles through patterns of silence and activity at about one cycle per second. These are the slow oscillations, sweeping waves of hyperpolarization (down states) and depolarization (up states) in the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, the thalamus generates spindles, brief bursts of higher-frequency activity in the 11–16 Hz range. When spindles are precisely timed to the upstate of a slow oscillation, the conditions are ideal for strengthening synaptic connections—a process believed to stabilize memory traces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have shown that this SO-spindle coupling declines with age and is associated with both memory decline and cognitive impairment. But what about day-to-day variability? Could an unusually rich day of learning, for example, “tune” your brain to couple SOs and spindles more tightly as you sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Testing the Trait vs. State Debate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle this question, a research team studied 41 young adults over two nights: one after a word-pair learning task and one control night with no learning. Some participants learned a modest list of 40 word pairs, while others memorized 120, and one group had to meet a minimum recall standard. The researchers measured SO-spindle coupling across these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they found no consistent differences in coupling strength between the learning and control nights—suggesting that pre-sleep learning alone may not significantly influence this aspect of sleep architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, within the group that reached a performance criterion, there was a correlation between memory performance and the &lt;em&gt;phase&lt;/em&gt; of SO-spindle coupling. This finding hints that while coupling may not change dramatically night-to-night, subtle aspects of its timing may still matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also uncovered a robust link between the amount of spindle power and the preferred phase of SO-spindle coupling—echoing previous findings that this relationship varies with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results support the idea that SO-spindle coupling may have both trait-like stability (reflecting an individual’s typical sleep structure) and state-dependent fine-tuning influenced by experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beyond Learning: How Metabolism Shapes Sleep Rhythms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not only learning, what else could shape SO-spindle coupling? One intriguing possibility is metabolic state. Recent work found that individuals with lower fasting glucose levels had stronger and more precise SO-spindle coupling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This association persisted after controlling for many demographic and health factors, though it disappeared when diabetes status was accounted for—pointing to a complex link between glucose metabolism and sleep oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal experiments provide even more direct evidence. In a study of adult rats, researchers manipulated metabolic state by fasting the animals for six hours before sleep or injecting them with glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting increased the density of both SOs and spindles, improved their co-occurrence, and shifted spindle timing closer to the upstate of the slow oscillation—an alignment thought to optimize memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucose injections, meanwhile, increased spindle density but didn’t affect SOs or their coupling. Importantly, these changes occurred without altering the overall amounts of NREM or REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that while age and baseline physiology set the stage, day-to-day factors like nutrition can modulate the fine structure of sleep rhythms, potentially enhancing the brain’s ability to consolidate memories overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Neurochemistry of Sleep Substates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more tantalizing is emerging evidence that NREM sleep itself isn’t uniform, but fluctuates through subtle substates over minutes at a time. These substates, identified in rodent studies, are defined by varying levels of neuromodulators like serotonin, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine—all of which are known to influence memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How these slow neurochemical waves interact with the precise timing of SOs and spindles is still largely unknown, but understanding it could unlock deeper insights into how sleep supports memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reinforce the idea that SO-spindle coupling is a dynamic interplay between stable individual characteristics and flexible state-dependent factors. While your personal sleep architecture likely provides a consistent baseline, it can still adapt—at least subtly—to what you’ve learned, what you’ve eaten, and possibly other yet-unknown variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those looking to optimize their &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/sleep-spindles-blood-sugar-23596/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep for better memory&lt;/a&gt;, this research offers some practical lessons: maintaining healthy metabolic habits may support more effective sleep-based memory consolidation. And it underscores the importance of high-quality sleep itself—not just quantity, but the integrity of its underlying rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research is now needed to uncover the exact circuit-level mechanisms and to explore whether interventions like diet, neuromodulation, or targeted memory reactivation could enhance SO-spindle coupling in meaningful ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is far from passive. It’s a highly orchestrated process that relies on the exquisite timing of electrical and chemical signals to reinforce what we’ve learned and prepare us for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By continuing to unravel how slow oscillations and spindles work together—and how they can be tuned by our daily experiences—scientists are bringing us closer to understanding how to make the most of our sleeping hours for our waking minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; This work was supported by Gemeinnützige Hertie-Stiftung, Network for Excellence in Clinical Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.70204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Sleep EEG—Stable Trait or Shaped by Experience?&lt;/a&gt; ” by Niels Niethard. &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Sleep EEG—Stable Trait or Shaped by Experience? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consolidation of newly encoded memories into long-term storage critically depends on plasticity processes during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is assumed that memory representations are facilitated by repeated reactivation of neuronal firing patterns during sleep, which promotes synaptic plasticity and thereby strengthens memory traces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence shows that such memory reactivations occur during specific oscillatory patterns in the EEG that are unique to sleep (Brodt et al. 2023).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 13:23:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE5HMllJOGF2TUlCeW5vT2xEdWpvamwxOFlzWWdWMS1VdU5KV1J0aHNJVXBmUFFYcU4wcHJBT3JBV04xQ0pOYXJYd0tTY1loLUszcVJKd3pHbW1FZ2V0THpXVXNuamtJNEk</guid></item><item><title>Lizzo认为这种按摩有助于她的身体转变-背后有真正的科学- AOL.com | Lizzo Credits This Type Of Massage For Helping With Her Body Transformation—And There's Real Science Behind It - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5qa21pTUhsMWstbXdSRlljMTZkeGlRSFZhVVItamFLaVdPMkJnbU5rMFM1LVRVWXg2RUNHdWpBb2dRRW02NkNydUM0ZHIyY2ZlUDFISy1kN3h4ajNLZDU3cG9nUUZkS1Y2NmgyUHdmUTZZZHN0T1Q1Tg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Lizzo Saw This Beauty Expert To Get Cover Ready&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Getty Images/Flavia Lanini&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lizzo is many things—a singer, a songwriter, an actor, and, now, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a65192751/lizzo-transformation-health-journey/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a cover star;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a cover star&lt;/a&gt;. When the entertainer, who's birth name is Melissa Viviane Jefferson, appeared in the &lt;em&gt;Women's Health&lt;/em&gt; Summer 2025 issue, she appeared fit, healthy, and at peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last few years have been transformative for the 37-year-old, both inside &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; out. Lizzo is quick to point out that her &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a65319688/lizzo-fuel-like-healthy-eating-habits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:body reinvention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;body reinvention&lt;/a&gt; is not the result of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a43557514/ozempic-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ozempic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; or weight loss surgery, but rather diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes. She loads up on &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g44560437/healthy-sheet-pan-dinners/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein-rich meals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein-rich meals&lt;/a&gt;, works out five days per week, hosts spiritual retreats...and relies on some help from a very special friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four-time Grammy winner has been outspoken on social media about the pivotal role celebrity &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a32171081/lymphatic-drainage-massage/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lymphatic drainage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lymphatic drainage&lt;/a&gt; specialist &lt;a href="https://flavialanini.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flavia Lanini;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Flavia Lanini&lt;/a&gt; has played in her wellness journey. She's a regular at Lanini’s eponymous Beauty Institute in Beverly Hills, indulging in her signature detox treatment once or twice weekly. The results speak for themselves, as seen in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLq4AAvRTD_/?img_index=5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:before and after;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;before and after&lt;/a&gt; phot0 posted to Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lanini, it all comes to down to Lizzo’s dedication and effort—and their ongoing relationship. “I always tell my clients that they really need to trust in the process and trust &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. If that happens, I can deliver results—and I’m so happy with Lizzo’s results,” she says. “We took a different approach to weight loss than she ever had before, using holistic treatments and targeting all-around health.” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, more on exactly what Lanini did to have Lizzo looking—and feeling—good as hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The woman behind the woman. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lanini, Lizzo first came to see her about a year ago, with the goal of both losing weight and improving her overall health. “We really wanted to take the natural approach because she hates needles and can’t handle pain,” she says. That meant regular &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64653766/benefits-of-sauna/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sauna sessions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sauna sessions&lt;/a&gt;, drinking Lanini’s detoxifying teas, several non-invasive muscle- and skin-tightening treatments, and a re-framing of her attitude toward food and nutrition. At the crux of their protocol? Lanini’s signature detox treatment. “This was really the best process for Lizzo because it helped boost her metabolism so much. We started doing it once or twice per week,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Brazilian-born Lanini is a lymphatic drainage expert, and lymphatic drainage is involved, the treatment is far more than that. “My technique is different because of my background and training. Being an esthetician in Brazil is nothing like being an esthetician here. I went to university for five years to earn my degree, and then spent 11 years working with doctors,” she explains. In fact, a similar protocol is even used on cancer patients in Brazil to help detox the body in between treatment rounds, she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultrasound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up, an ultrasound treatment on the abdomen to help stimulate digestion. “Think of your gut as an apple tree. The ultrasound works to shake it and remove the ‘apples,’ the build-up on the gut lining,” she explains. This not only helps get things moving, so to speak, but also boosts metabolism and can even help combat brain fog. When your body doesn’t need to expend energy cleaning the gut, it can focus that energy elsewhere, Lanini claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step two involves a head-to-toe rubdown. Rather than relying on traditional lymphatic drainage techniques (more on those in a moment), Lanini’s method focuses on relaxing the fascia around the muscle to improve the muscle’s functionality and movement, in turn stimulating the lymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massage is paired with Lanini’s proprietary topical sculpting cream featuring guarana, a caffeine-rich Brazilian plant. Post-massage, the cream is mixed with different salts and clay and applied underneath a wrap to boost additional detoxification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sauna&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a 20-minute sauna session, Lanini's clients sip on a detoxifying, lymph-supporting tea, which also boasts Brazilian ingredients including acai, guarana, and hibiscus, among others. “It helps keep the body balanced, combats gut inflammation, and acts as electrolytes while you’re in the sauna,” Lanini explains, who adds that Lizzo drinks the tea twice daily. When all is said and done, clients feel lighter, less bloated, sleep better, and have improved energy, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this was Lizzo’s standard regimen, Lanini upped the ante before a big event, like the Met Gala (or our cover shoot). “When she wanted to be even more snatched we’d do the detox treatment three days in a row. You really do end up with a completely different body,” Lanini says. She adds that because Lizzo was also concerned with loose skin after losing so much weight, they also incorporated VelaShape, which tightens the skin using radiofrequency and other energy modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing it all home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for those of us who can’t see Lanini regularly? Even the much more widely-available, traditional lymphatic drainage massages can help improve both health and aesthetic appearance. “Think of the lymphatic system as your body’s waste management system,” says Andy Wood, a masseuse specializing in lymphatic drainage massage at Chicago’s &lt;a href="https://milkandhoneyspa.com/locations/gold-coast-chicago/chicago-gold-coast/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Milk + Honey Spa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Milk + Honey Spa&lt;/a&gt;. It helps to move and flush out a variety of toxins and debris, including excess fluid, cellular waste, viruses and more, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike blood, which is pumped by the heart, there’s nothing actually pumping the lymphatic system. It moves when we move, or as a result of gravity, compression, or manual stimulation, adds Morgana Kemper, owner of &lt;a href="https://labrasileiramassage.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:La Brasiliera;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;La Brasiliera&lt;/a&gt;, a spa specializing in Brazilian lymphatic drainage massage with locations in Charlotte and Chicago. Lymphatic drainage massage is a way of manually boosting the lymphatic system and is ideal for combatting swelling and strengthening immunity, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as aesthetics go, it’s important to point out that lymphatic drainage massage alone isn’t going to &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;cause any kind of real weight loss, Wood says. Rather, when paired with diet and exercise (as in Lizzo’s case), it can help enhance the effects and appearance of that weight loss, he explains. Still, because it does flush out excess fluid, it can help make the body, particularly the abdomen, appear slimmer and more contoured, Kemper says. And while lymphatic drainage is generally very gentle (think subtle tapping and soft, sweeping motions), Brazilian techniques in particular can be a bit firmer and help redistribute fat cells for an even greater contouring effect, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, both experts we spoke with say getting a lymphatic drainage massage monthly is ideal for those looking to make it a part of their wellness or weight loss routine. Can’t get to the spa? Kemper is a big fan of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a61973861/best-rebounding-workouts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:trampoline rebounding;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;trampoline rebounding&lt;/a&gt;: “It can make the lymphatic system flow 15 times faster,” she says. Or, try &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64523152/what-is-dry-brushing/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=20192787275&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACrQpnxzZaR2nlkmsMjHsOjBJ52ib&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwyvfDBhDYARIsAItzbZGDGU0-U7kQyt2tJrZl3vVCOOiHAap-L5OcoRrtx7phB7-LakxcH7AaAkniEALw_wcB" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dry brushing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dry brushing&lt;/a&gt;, another easy, at-home, lymph-boosting option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The picture-perfect proof.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Lizzo is the best advertisement for an integrative, holistic approach as the gateway to healthy, long-lasting changes. “Not only has she lost half of her body weight, she’s also so much more conscious of her health now. And that’s because we went from the inside-out,” says Lanini of her poster-child client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lizzo echoed these sentiments when she spoke with &lt;em&gt;WH. &lt;/em&gt;Yes, she’s surpassed her goal weight, but she’s also released the mental weight of feeling judged by others—and herself. “It’s not just about before-and-after photos. It’s about consistency, discipline, and self-love. I’m beyond honored to be a part of your transformation and your healing process. You’re not just inspiring others, you’re leading the way,” Lanini captioned the recent &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLq4AAvRTD_/?img_index=5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Instagram post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt; where she showcased Lizzo’s results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t agree more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 13:13:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5qa21pTUhsMWstbXdSRlljMTZkeGlRSFZhVVItamFLaVdPMkJnbU5rMFM1LVRVWXg2RUNHdWpBb2dRRW02NkNydUM0ZHIyY2ZlUDFISy1kN3h4ajNLZDU3cG9nUUZkS1Y2NmgyUHdmUTZZZHN0T1Q1Tg</guid></item><item><title>这种常见的血压药物延长了动物的寿命，减缓了衰老- ScienceAlert | This Common Blood Pressure Drug Extends Lifespan, Slows Aging in Animals - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPcWFDVWFWS3NJVjJVeFl4X0VzR0c4c1lyT1BUR1pRa2VpNzBqWTAyd3dDTmFsenlDdm1FbV9jSUR2S2g5RlgyRnJ4VXNEWUo1SlBWa2t6VkpqVU1LZGVfOVEzN1RJVFp4TENfVHlhc1pZU3k3UkFiZGlnMmphdnU4R1RIdTRXSW1fbVdTUmhpZy1OWnlmb3pOVWVHaEpNVzZNTWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The hypertension drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilmenidine"&gt;rilmenidine&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to slow down aging in worms, an effect that in humans could hypothetically help us live longer and keep us healthier in our latter years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown rilmenidine mimics the effects of caloric restriction on a cellular level. Reducing available energy while maintaining nutrition within the body has been shown to extend lifespans &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24146-z"&gt;in several animal models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this translates to human biology, or is a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/skipping-meals-could-be-much-worse-for-you-than-we-realized"&gt;potential risk to our health&lt;/a&gt;, is a topic of &lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2020/can-calorie-restriction-extend-your-lifespan/"&gt;ongoing debate&lt;/a&gt;. Finding ways to achieve the same benefits without the costs of extreme calorie cutting could lead to new ways to improve health in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in 2023, young and old &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worms treated with the drug – which is normally used to treat high blood pressure – lived longer and presented higher measures in a variety of health markers in the same way as restricting calories, as the scientists had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have been able to show in animals that rilmenidine can increase lifespan," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said molecular biogerontologist João Pedro Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Birmingham in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are now keen to explore if rilmenidine may have other clinical applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-aging-cocktail-extends-mouse-lifespan-by-about-30-percent?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Anti-Aging Cocktail Extends Mouse Lifespan by About 30 Percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; worm is a favorite for studies, because many of its genes have similarities to counterparts in our genome. Yet in spite of these similarities, it is still a rather distant relation to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg" alt="Various cell types illustrated in shades of pink" class="size-full wp-image-144581" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642-600x334.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some human cell types and their nuclei on the left, compared to cells from &lt;em&gt;C. elegans &lt;/em&gt;on the right.

This particular chemical structure could be targeted in future attempts to improve lifespan and slow down aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that the lifespan-extending effects of rilmenidine were abolished when nish-1 was deleted," the researchers explained in their &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Critically, rescuing the nish-1 receptor reinstated the increase in lifespan upon treatment with rilmenidine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-calorie diets are hard to follow and come with a variety of side effects, such as hair thinning, dizziness, and brittle bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's early days still, but the thinking is that this hypertension drug could confer the same benefits as a low-calorie diet while being easier on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg" alt="A man sitting on a couch taking his blood pressure" class="size-full wp-image-141684" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rilmenidine is normally used to treat high blood pressure.

ROACH: I have low serum cholesterol but a high coronary calcium score, and I was told to take magnesium supplements to bring my calcium score down (in addition to daily aspirin and a statin). What are your thoughts about magnesium to bring down a high calcium score? -- D.B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EPM4DYX4GVEKZGZ6GCT3Z5R6JE"&gt;ANSWER: A coronary calcium score is a measurement of calcium in the blood vessels of the heart. High coronary calcium scores predict an increased likelihood of blockages in the blood vessels, which can lead to a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NZ7LHZUP4JCRRDYU2WQKUNU3WQ"&gt;The literature is mixed about whether a high magnesium intake can reduce the risk of coronary calcium and, in theory, reduce heart disease risk. Most of the evidence suggests that high blood magnesium levels reduce heart disease risk. However, people with higher magnesium levels are more likely to be consuming a healthier diet, which is known to reduce heart disease risk by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RGLA72QGQJFQVLUJXEHIEARPOA"&gt;To be sure that magnesium helps prevent heart disease, a future large trial could give half the subjects a magnesium supplement and the other half an identical-appearing pill without magnesium, then follow the groups to see which is more likely to get heart disease. These types of trials are difficult, time-consuming and expensive, and they have not yet been done for magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZJTCYIGRJNA43GNLY5JEQRZ7VM"&gt;However, you already have coronary calcium, so you are at a higher risk for a heart attack. Studies that have looked at the use of magnesium supplementation to prevent a heart attack in people with known or suspected blockages haven’t consistently found a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DQK47HMYF5FPHDHZFILIYHRQAI"&gt;This is in contrast to statin trials, which have universally shown a reduction in heart attack rates in people with coronary blockages or those who are at a very high risk. Statins are effective at reducing risk for people with known blockages in their arteries, even if they have normal cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="B4ZVP2R3PZARDLDH24GLOPPHME"&gt;Having a low cholesterol level reduces but does not eliminate the risk for blockages.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 &lt;strong&gt;Groundbreaking IVF technique&lt;/strong&gt; successfully delivers eight healthy babies in the UK, free from severe mitochondrial diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌟 The new method, called &lt;strong&gt;Mitochondrial Donation Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;, uses DNA from three sources to prevent the transmission of harmful mutations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👶 Significant reduction in &lt;strong&gt;mutated mitochondrial DNA&lt;/strong&gt; observed, with all children healthy at birth and minimal health issues reported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💡 Despite its success, this procedure remains &lt;strong&gt;controversial&lt;/strong&gt; and unapproved in many countries, sparking ethical debates on genetic intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent advancements in in vitro fertilization (IVF) technology have once again brought hope and joy to families worldwide. In a remarkable achievement, United Kingdom doctors have successfully delivered eight healthy babies using an innovative DNA-enhanced IVF method. This groundbreaking technique, aimed at preventing the transmission of severe mitochondrial diseases, has proven effective in giving these children a disease-free start in life. The news not only marks a significant milestone in reproductive medicine but also raises intriguing ethical and scientific discussions about the future of genetic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Mitochondrial Diseases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria, often referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;powerhouses of the cell&lt;/strong&gt;, play a crucial role in energy production. Despite their small size, they contain a separate set of DNA, distinct from the nuclear DNA inherited from both parents. When mutations occur in mitochondrial DNA, it can lead to serious health issues. These mutations can severely affect energy supply to vital organs such as the heart, muscles, and brain, often resulting in developmental delays and a shortened lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, around &lt;strong&gt;one in 5,000 newborns&lt;/strong&gt; are affected by these debilitating conditions, experiencing symptoms like vision loss and muscle weakening. The recent breakthrough in IVF technology, known as Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT), offers a promising solution. By utilizing healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor, this technique aims to eliminate the risk of inheriting such diseases, providing a healthier future for those affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cM5cjTCL7P"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/its-like-teleporting-knowledge-this-breakthrough-optical-ai-chip-transfers-100-million-books-in-just-7-minutes-using-light-speed-data/"&gt;“It’s Like Teleporting Knowledge”: This Breakthrough Optical AI Chip Transfers 100 Million Books in Just 7 Minutes Using Light-Speed Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Innovative Three-source Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new IVF technique, known as &lt;strong&gt;Pronuclear Transfer&lt;/strong&gt;, involves a revolutionary approach to conception. By combining DNA from three sources—the mother’s egg, the father’s sperm, and healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor—this method ensures that the child inherits the vast majority of their traits from their biological parents. However, they also receive a small fraction (approximately 0.1%) of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the donor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This genetic alteration, while minute, is significant enough to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases. The process involves transferring the nuclear DNA from an egg with a mitochondrial DNA mutation into a donor egg with its nucleus removed. The resulting embryo, which contains the parents’ nuclear DNA and the donor’s healthy mitochondrial DNA, is then implanted, leading to a successful pregnancy. This approach not only offers hope for affected families but also opens new doors in the field of genetic research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zIWn6ShkUq"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/nvidia-helix-destroys-ai-lag-forever-ultra-powerful-system-instantly-transforms-stalled-chatbots-into-million-word-lightning-fast-assistants-for-us-businesses/"&gt;“NVIDIA Helix Destroys AI Lag Forever”: Ultra-Powerful System Instantly Transforms Stalled Chatbots Into Million-Word, Lightning-Fast Assistants for US Businesses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Promising Results and Ongoing Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the study have been overwhelmingly positive, with a &lt;strong&gt;95-100% reduction in mutated mitochondrial DNA&lt;/strong&gt; observed in six of the babies. The remaining two showed a substantial reduction of 77-88%, well below the threshold for disease manifestation. All eight children were healthy at birth, with only minor, treatable health issues reported in a few cases. This success demonstrates the potential of the technique to transform lives, offering a disease-free future to children who might otherwise face severe health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its success, the procedure remains controversial and is not yet approved in many countries, including the US and France. Ethical objections include concerns about the destruction of human embryos and fears of the emergence of “designer babies.” These debates underscore the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications of genetic intervention, even as science continues to push boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hpe0Pfyv7f"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/it-transforms-while-flying-engineers-create-shape-shifting-robot-that-morphs-mid-air-to-land-and-roll-on-wheels/"&gt;“It Transforms While Flying”: Engineers Create Shape-Shifting Robot That Morphs Mid-Air to Land and Roll on Wheels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethical Considerations and Future Prospects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any groundbreaking scientific advancement, the development of MDT has sparked ethical debates. Critics argue that altering the genetic makeup of embryos raises concerns about the potential for unintended consequences and the moral implications of such interventions. Supporters, however, emphasize the profound impact this technology can have on families affected by mitochondrial diseases, offering them a chance at a healthier future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of this procedure have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine, providing a comprehensive overview of the scientific and ethical considerations involved. As the technique continues to evolve, it will be crucial for the scientific community, policymakers, and the public to engage in open dialogues about the responsible use of genetic technologies. How will society balance the potential benefits of these advances with the ethical considerations they entail?&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study offers fresh insights into how structural brain connectivity patterns are linked to psychopathic traits and the externalizing behaviors that often accompany them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published using data from the MPI Leipzig Mind-Brain–Body dataset, the research examined 82 young adults, employing advanced connectome-based predictive modeling to pinpoint the structural networks underlying psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings illuminate not just &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; in the brain psychopathy may reside, but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; its expression can lead to outwardly harmful behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study identifies two distinct neural pathways that appear to mediate the relationship between psychopathic traits and externalizing actions — opening up potential avenues for targeted interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychopathy and the Externalizing Spectrum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychopathy occupies a unique place within the externalizing spectrum — a broad category of behavioral problems that includes aggression, substance abuse, impulsivity, and rule-breaking. People high in psychopathic traits often exhibit these behaviors more prominently than their peers, creating serious personal, social, and legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have already pointed to abnormalities in brain functioning and connectivity in individuals with high psychopathic traits. Functional imaging research, for instance, has identified reduced activity in regions critical for emotion regulation, such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, less is known about the &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; wiring of the brain in psychopathy — that is, the white matter pathways that physically connect distant brain regions and enable them to communicate effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Network-Based Approach to Psychopathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study takes a network-level perspective, reflecting a broader trend in neuroscience that views mental disorders not as localized “lesions” but as disruptions in the dynamic interactions between brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using structural connectome data derived from diffusion MRI, the researchers constructed a comprehensive map of each participant’s brain connectivity — a so-called &lt;em&gt;connectome&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then applied a predictive modeling framework, systematically leaving out one participant at a time to validate their findings (a rigorous technique known as leave-one-out cross-validation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their analysis revealed two sets of networks associated with psychopathy: one set of connections where greater integrity was positively related to psychopathic traits (the “positive network”) and another set where greater integrity was negatively related to psychopathy (the “negative network”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Positive and Negative Networks: A Tale of Two Pathways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;positive network&lt;/em&gt; involved structural connections among brain regions implicated in social-affective processing, language comprehension, and reward sensitivity. These regions include areas such as the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, and subcortical reward circuitry — all of which are crucial for interpreting social cues, evaluating rewards and punishments, and making moral decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher connectivity in these areas in psychopathic individuals may paradoxically support their superficial charm, manipulativeness, and reward-driven behavior, despite their emotional deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the &lt;em&gt;negative network&lt;/em&gt; encompassed connections between regions involved in attentional control and modulation, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal attention systems. Reduced structural connectivity here may underlie the poor impulse control and inability to inhibit inappropriate behaviors that are hallmarks of psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these two opposing networks illustrate the complexity of psychopathy as a disorder that combines emotional detachment with impulsive, often destructive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Neural Pathways Linking Psychopathy to Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the study didn’t stop at identifying networks — it also investigated how these networks might mediate the relationship between psychopathic traits and externalizing behaviors. Through mediation analyses, the researchers identified two distinct pathways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Processing Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Involving the positive network, this pathway connects psychopathic traits to externalizing behaviors through dysfunctions in social-affective and reward-related processing. Individuals high in psychopathy may fail to feel guilt or empathy and remain highly motivated by immediate rewards, making them more prone to antisocial actions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention Modulation Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Involving the negative network, this pathway links psychopathy to externalizing behaviors through impaired attentional control. Difficulty shifting attention away from rewarding stimuli or suppressing inappropriate impulses may exacerbate risk-taking and aggressive behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings elegantly map onto clinical observations of psychopathy: the chilling emotional coldness coupled with rash, reckless actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Intervention and Future Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By uncovering the distinct neural pathways that bridge psychopathy and externalizing behavior, this research opens potential new avenues for intervention. Therapies that target attentional control — such as mindfulness training or cognitive remediation — may be particularly helpful for addressing impulsive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, interventions that aim to enhance social-affective understanding, such as empathy training or moral reasoning exercises, may help reduce the more callous aspects of psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, these findings highlight the importance of viewing psychopathy as a disorder of network dysfunction rather than a single brain region. This perspective aligns with contemporary models of mental illness that emphasize the brain’s connectivity and systems-level organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will need to explore whether these structural abnormalities are present early in development, perhaps even before behavioral symptoms fully emerge. Longitudinal research could determine whether interventions aimed at strengthening specific networks could mitigate the emergence or severity of psychopathy and its associated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A More Nuanced View of Psychopathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychopathy has often been portrayed in starkly negative or sensationalized terms, but findings like these offer a more nuanced view. They remind us that even the most troubling behaviors may have roots in the intricate workings of the brain’s wiring, shaped by genetic and environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these neural underpinnings not only advances science but also holds the potential to inform more compassionate and effective approaches to prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we continue to map the brain’s networks and unravel how they give rise to behavior, studies like this one bring us closer to decoding the enigma of psychopathy — and, in turn, to finding ways to help those whose lives are touched by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopathy and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.70158" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Role of Structural Brain Networks in Psychopathy and Its Relation to Externalizing Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;” by Peiyang Guo et al. &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role of Structural Brain Networks in Psychopathy and Its Relation to Externalizing Behaviors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Externalizing behaviors are particularly pronounced in the context of psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent neurobiological models suggest that psychopathy may be associated with abnormalities in brain network connectivity, which could contribute to its development and its links to externalizing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the specific structural networks contributing to psychopathy and its relation to externalizing behaviors remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated the structural connectivity associated with psychopathy and its relation to externalizing behaviors in 82 young adults from the MPI Leipzig Mind-Brain–Body dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A structural connectome–based prediction model with leave-one-out cross-validation identified both positive and negative networks associated with psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the positive network involved regions related to social-affective processing, language, and reward systems, while the negative network was associated with regions involved in attention modulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, mediation analyses revealed two potential neural pathways from psychopathic traits to externalizing behaviors via emotional processing and attention modulation networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that alterations in structural connectivity play a significant role in psychopathy and may underlie the externalizing behaviors observed in individuals with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

odds ratio, 2.71; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .005).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the two groups were further subdivided into two groups each — those with and without SIBO — significant further variations of microbial diversity were observed between those with and without HT, Mathur told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, we saw the small bowel microbiome was not only different in SIBO-positive patients, including higher gram negatives, which is to be expected, but that the presence or absence of hypothyroidism itself was associated with specific patterns of these gram-negative bacteria,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition, when we looked at hypothyroidism without SIBO present, there were also changes between groups, such as higher &lt;em&gt;Neisseria &lt;/em&gt;in the hypothyroid group.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these findings are novel as this is the first paper to look specifically at the small bowel,” she added, noting that previous smaller studies have focused more on evaluation of stool samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe the small bowel is the most metabolically active area of the intestine and plays an important role in metabolism,” Mathur noted. “Thus, the microbial changes here are likely more physiologically significant than the patterns seen in stool.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further Findings from a Large Population&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate analysis, the team evaluated data from the TriNetX database on the 10-year incidence of developing SIBO among 1.1 million subjects with hypothyroidism in the US compared with 1 million controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that people with hypothyroidism were approximately twice as likely to develop SIBO compared with those without hypothyroidism (relative risk [RR], 2.20).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, those with HT, in particular, had an even higher risk, at 2.4 times the controls (RR, 2.40).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment with levothyroxine decreased the risk of developing SIBO in hypothyroidism (RR, 0.33) and HT (RR, 0.78) vs those who did not receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanisms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the fact that differences in SIBO were observed even between people who were treated for HT and those without the condition in the first analysis, and hence had similar TSH levels, was notable, Mathur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that perhaps there are other factors aside from TSH levels and free T4 that are at play here,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people have theorized that perhaps delayed gut motility in hypothyroidism promotes the development of SIBO; however, there are many other factors within this complex interplay between the microbiome and the thyroid that could also be playing a role.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, SIBO leads to inflammation and weakening of the gut barrier,” Mathur explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, “levothyroxine absorption and cycling of the thyroid hormone occurs predominantly in the small bowel, [while the] microbiome plays a key role in the absorption of iron, selenium, iodine, and zinc, which are critical for thyroid function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, “further research is needed to understand how the mechanisms are affected during the development of SIBO and hypothyroidism,” Mathur said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessment of Changes Over Time Anticipated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the research, Gregory A. Brent, MD, senior executive academic vice-chair of the Department of Medicine and professor of medicine and physiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California Los Angeles said the study is indeed novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This, to my knowledge, is the first investigation to link characteristics of the small bowel microbiome with hypothyroidism,” Brent told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While any clinical significance has yet to be determined, “the association of these small bowel microbiome changes with hypothyroidism may have implications for contributing to the onset of autoimmune hypothyroidism in susceptible populations as well as influences on levothyroxine absorption in hypothyroid patients on levothyroxine therapy,” Brent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the SIBO differences observed even among treated patients with vs without HT, “it seems less likely that the microbiome changes are the result of reduced thyroid hormone signaling,” Brent noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a key piece of the puzzle will be to observe the microbiome changes over time, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These studies were at a single time point [and] longitudinal studies will be especially important to see how the association changes over time and are influenced by the treatment of hypothyroidism and of SIBO,” Brent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The authors and Brent had no disclosures to report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:27:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNcll1VUo5TWFJQUY4T0tfU2EtT1JxZ01IWU9UVExhS245TzIwSGFxVmZlbkdydnhwcldidXRXVEVxV3Q4RkY2R1RfU2toV1M4SUgxNlU4dzlKZm5PdmkwdEJJLWl3RnVyay02N2tpZk0yYTMzbzI5ZFlobHd4YW5FZlZoM1FFWGZkSUs4blFfRlNoWU54NlpmVFRQOTdIRW1Z</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，有助于降低血压的6种最佳谷物- EatingWell | The 6 Best Cereals to Help Lower Blood Pressure, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNaXZIT1UtZmxVaGVFb3lGeDJNUG04SUs2WXZZV1lhSkljeHc2Mm10YmtGVE1TRzhieFAxaWlIYTVjRjRsMElnQkNEOVpwVkJuQTA0VE9OdDh4ZHhiLXRSb3JMZUZ4RUUzN0ZKN1lZTGFDUktDUjJkWXl1b0M2ZV90dzVlSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Surprisingly, breakfast cereal can be a smart choice—if you pick the right kind. Research shows that high-fiber, low-sugar cereals may support heart health and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-blood-pressure-factors-study-11742722" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower the risk of hypertension&lt;/a&gt; (high blood pressure).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But not all cereals are created equal—especially sugary ones with cookie pieces, chocolate and marshmallows, so it’s best to steer clear of those. Instead, check out these six options.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I recommend that clients add muesli to their cereal lineup,” says&lt;a href="http://thedietitiandish.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Any kind of unsweetened muesli can support healthy blood pressure, but Alpen’s No Sugar Added variety is a particularly smart choice. It includes a mix of oats, wheat flakes, dried fruit and nuts, providing an excellent source of fiber—one of the most important nutrients for blood pressure. “Fiber has been shown to be supportive in overall heart health by lowering blood pressure,” Kolesa says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The negligible sodium (20 milligrams, or less than 1% of the Daily Value) is another point in this cereal’s favor.

Sometimes the best and healthiest options are the most basic. “I recommend plain old bran flakes,” says&lt;a href="http://soundbitesnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Lisa Andrews, M.Ed., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “They provide 10% of the Daily Value for calcium (and higher with milk).

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Campbell, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/58391/the-1-food-you-should-eat-for-breakfast/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oats are one of the top ingredients&lt;/a&gt; to look for in a cereal that supports healthy blood pressure. “Oats and barley contain a soluble fiber, beta-glucan, which may help lower blood pressure, especially in those with a higher BMI (body mass index),” she says. In fact, a 2023 study found that oat consumption significantly reduced systolic blood pressure, particularly among people with hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With oat flour as its first ingredient, Simple Truth’s Organic Toasted Oats Cereal certainly fits the bill. At 1⅔ cups, the serving size is pretty filling, too. For even more nutrition, add fresh berries or a banana for extra fiber and potassium.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair with fruit. &lt;/strong&gt;Whether fresh, frozen or dried, fruits like berries, bananas and apples add fiber and potassium—two important nutrients for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-high-blood-pressure-8769222" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use reduced or low-fat milk. &lt;/strong&gt;Research is still teasing apart the complex relationship between dairy and heart health, but the American Heart Association continues to recommend low-fat milk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to calcium. &lt;/strong&gt;Don’t miss out on calcium for your blood pressure. Cow’s milk and fortified plant milks are good sources of this heart-healthy mineral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check sodium levels. &lt;/strong&gt;Some cereal brands sneak in more sodium than you might realize—so be sure to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-i-check-first-on-the-nutrition-label-8548484" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;read the nutrition label carefully&lt;/a&gt;. A low-sodium cereal is one that provides 5% or less of the Daily Value per serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Each year, World Brain Day is celebrated with a specific theme imparting a conscious effort to understand the importance of neurological care. This year the theme is, “Brain Health for All Ages”, which underscores the 12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt; annual celebration of the event, emphasizing that brain health is not a fleeting concern- it’s a commitment spanning from the womb to the young age and then to the old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journey to brain wellness begins from the day the fetus starts growing in the womb, which is shaped further by parental care, nutrition and eating habits, lifestyle and most importantly, the environment in which we live. Every stage- from infancy, childhood to the old age period, our neurological system and even our body demands mindful care and proactive habits for proper growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it is rightly said by Prof. Wolfgang Grisold, President of the World Federation of Neurology (WFN)- “Brain health isn’t a moment in time—it’s a lifelong commitment. World Brain Day 2025 is our call to action to protect neurological well-being from the earliest stages of development, through childhood, adulthood and into older age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a commitment to care, equity, and access for all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;What do you think is the most significant factor affecting brain health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain Day celebration isn’t just an initiative; it’s the most important tool in any human’s body. Just imagine for a moment, every thought we have, our feelings, our emotion, our understanding that channels decision making in our life- everything matters on our comprehending skills. So, who channels it- obviously it’s our brain- a three- pound intricate marvel nestled within our skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present time, we are surrounded with a lot of technological advancement and with those complications have also led its way, mental health has become a prominent issue. And brain function is one of the components which matters more than ever, when it comes to mental health issues. Why? Because everything starts from the brain as it comprehends the meaning which further leads to mood swings, mental intake of a particular situation. At present, we need to take it seriously because neurological disorders are now the leading cause of disability- adjusted life years (DALYs) globally, which is the second leading cause of death after heart disease. New research links unhealthy lifestyle habits, environmental toxins and poor nutrition surge in conditions like Alzheimer’s, depression, Parkinson’s etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite these sobering realities, people are not properly educated about the importance of neurological health, funding for neurological research is woefully inadequate compared to other diseases. The reason behind includes lack of knowledge, awareness and prioritization. So, every year, World Brain Day is celebrated as an initiative to bridge the knowledge gap by placing the brain squarely in the spotlight, igniting global conversations, and urging immediate action. It should be taken as a public health priority, because if we count in numbers, over 1 billion people worldwide live with a neurological disorder. As we traverse the modern landscape, marked by technological growth with a greater life expectancy, we need to figure out a way for better brain cell growth, because the health of our brains determines the destiny of individuals and a better family. The conversation is urgent, so the call and action must be taken promptly- Brain should be for all ages and a key priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the Harvard Medical School, the human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons forming about 100 trillion connections—networks so complex that they dwarf the capabilities of the human mind to fully comprehend. New fields like connectomics aim to map these tangled networks to understand how different regions and cells work together to produce thoughts and behaviors. According to various reports and research studies, the human brain gets smaller as we get older and it keeps on developing until our late 40s, the fun fact is the human brain is the largest brain of all vertebrates relative to body size and it triples its size in the first year of life approximately to 80% by two years of age. As referenced in Scientific Americana study, “if the brain worked like a digital video recorder, 2.5 petabytes would indeed suffice to hold three million hours of television, meaning we’d have to watch TV continuously for more than 300 years to fill it up.” This super-computer consumes about 20% of the body’s energy, despite being made of nearly 75% water, the brain is more efficient than any existing computer, processing information faster than the fastest computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, this July 22, let’s come together not just for brain development, but for a better healthy lifestyle. Because a healthier brain is not just about personal wellness—it is the root of flourishing communities and a thriving world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 11:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>蛇和蜘蛛毒液产生数百种“有前途”的潜在抗生素-好消息网络 | Snake and Spider Venom Produce Hundreds of ‘Promising’ Potential Antibiotics - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOTlllZGJ1Mm9RSVpSUGh4RlFfcDZ0WVIxcU5fZVJkMjcxNDJucHhwRHFSX3VLUF9uOFNZajNUa3EwajB5c0xIS3c5VmR1b1pudG51ZmJtRkJRX3BLbkpwOVlaV09QZ2dQWkpZSHZXcDExUUE5a0RVbnNKVzJYS0JuQ3l3RnR6dWUyUTB5Z0h5NHp1eTBkOFgxVUNucnNJQVQ4bFAtSFhWLTA1aVU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of potential antibiotics have been discovered in snake and spider venom thanks to AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A screening of global venom libraries, powered by artificial intelligence uncovered dozens of “promising” new drug candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI has already been used to complete &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/thousands-of-sources-for-new-antibiotics-to-fight-superbugs-found-using-ai-and-dozens-worked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;screenings of plant compounds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/scientists-find-drug-that-could-combat-drug-resistant-infections-like-mrsa-thanks-to-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;existing drugs&lt;/a&gt; in search of potential new antibiotics, and snake, scorpion, and spider venoms have proven a fruitful hunting ground as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic resistance contributes to more than one million deaths worldwide every year. Finding alternative compounds that can eliminate these pathogens is one of medicine’s great ongoing missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States used a deep-learning system called APEX to sift through a database of more than 40 million venom encrypted peptides (VEPs), tiny proteins evolved by animals to ravage the nervous system, blood cells, and organs of their prey and/or attackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm flagged 386 compounds within a matter of hours with the molecular hallmarks of next-generation antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Venoms are evolutionary masterpieces, yet their antimicrobial potential has barely been explored,” said senior study author Professor César de la Fuente. “APEX lets us scan an immense chemical space in just hours and identify peptides with exceptional potential to fight the world’s most stubborn pathogens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the AI-selected shortlist, the team synthesized 58 venom peptides for lab testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI IN MEDICINE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="In 10 Seconds, an AI Model Detects Cancerous Brain Tumors Often Missed During Surgery" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/in-10-seconds-an-ai-model-detects-cancerous-brain-tumors-often-missed-during-surgery/" rel="bookmark"&gt;In 10 Seconds, an AI Model Detects Cancerous Brain Tumors Often Missed During Surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, showed that 53 killed drug-resistant strains of bacteria, including &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; at doses that were harmless to human red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By pairing computational triage with traditional lab experimentation, we delivered one of the most comprehensive investigations of venom derived antibiotics to date,” said co-author Dr. Marcelo Torres in a release from his university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform mapped more than 2,000 entirely new antibacterial “motifs”—short, specific sequences of amino acids within a protein or peptide responsible for their ability to kill or inhibit bacterial growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is now taking the top peptide candidates, which could lead to new antibiotics, and improving them through medicinal-chemistry tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;

UCLA Health is using AI to help doctors catch strokes faster, reduce hospital re-admissions and spend more time with patients by automating medical notes, said Paul Lukac, chief AI officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keck Medicine of USC plans to offer employees a commercial AI chat tool to support stress management, according to Dr. Steven Siegel, chief mental health and wellness officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cedars-Sinai, Xaia — an acronym for eXtended-reality Artificially Intelligent Ally — was designed and programmed by Dr. Omer Liran, with ideas and research support from Dr. Brennan Spiegel and therapeutic input from clinical psychologist Robert Chernoff, in collaboration with the medical center’s Technology Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/10869a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2101+0+0/resize/320x448!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6c%2Fc8%2Fef32d3a643a0a1540e74ffc18248%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai02.JPG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/95ae986/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2101+0+0/resize/568x796!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6c%2Fc8%2Fef32d3a643a0a1540e74ffc18248%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai02.JPG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/310b29a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2101+0+0/resize/768x1076!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6c%2Fc8%2Fef32d3a643a0a1540e74ffc18248%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai02.JPG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6f3d5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2101+0+0/resize/1024x1434!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6c%2Fc8%2Fef32d3a643a0a1540e74ffc18248%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai02.JPG 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/67757b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2101+0+0/resize/1200x1681!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6c%2Fc8%2Fef32d3a643a0a1540e74ffc18248%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai02.JPG 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="Dr. Omer Liran." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff94920/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2101+0+0/resize/320x448!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6c%2Fc8%2Fef32d3a643a0a1540e74ffc18248%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai02.JPG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5e87d23/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2101+0+0/resize/568x796!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6c%2Fc8%2Fef32d3a643a0a1540e74ffc18248%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai02.JPG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b9c7df8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2101+0+0/resize/768x1076!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6c%2Fc8%2Fef32d3a643a0a1540e74ffc18248%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai02.JPG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/459b32a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2101+0+0/resize/1024x1434!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6c%2Fc8%2Fef32d3a643a0a1540e74ffc18248%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai02.JPG 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1d924ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2101+0+0/resize/1200x1681!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6c%2Fc8%2Fef32d3a643a0a1540e74ffc18248%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai02.JPG 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1d924ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2101+0+0/resize/1200x1681!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6c%2Fc8%2Fef32d3a643a0a1540e74ffc18248%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai02.JPG" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Dr. Omer Liran.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Cedars-Sinai)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;VRx Health, a for-profit company founded by Liran, holds an exclusive license from Cedars-Sinai to market Xaia commercially.

A web and mobile version is accessible to licensed clinicians for tiered pricing between $99 and $399-plus per month, which allows them to invite patients to use the tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liran, a psychiatrist, said Xaia is designed to supplement, and not replace, the services of mental health therapists amid a national shortage of providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if somebody needs to be seen once a week, they may only get seen once a month,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xaia app draws from hundreds of therapy transcripts, both from real sessions and mock sessions created by experts to sound like an actual therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if users tell Xaia they’re struggling with a new cancer diagnosis, the robot might say, “That must be very hard for you,” then ask how it’s affecting their mood, and what they find themselves doing when they’re overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Trying to stay positive when things feel so heavy must take a lot of energy,” the chatbot says. “When you notice yourself being pulled back into those difficult thoughts, what usually happens next?

Physical and emotional symptoms feed off each other, and tools like Xaia aim to help with both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool isn’t covered by insurance yet, but billing codes for virtual reality therapy and digital health services do exist, and other hospitals like the Mayo Clinic are beginning to use them. VRx has an agreement to deploy Xaia at Mayo Clinic, according to VRx Chief Executive Gabe Zetter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xaia isn’t the only app of its kind. Woebot, a pioneering chatbot developed by psychologist Alison Darcy while at Stanford, used scripted conversations based on cognitive behavioral therapy to support users with anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it reached 1.5 million users, the company shut down the app in July. Darcy said the company is now focused on building new tools with large language models, since AI is moving faster than regulators like the Food and Drug Administration can keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, some emotional support chatbots have been blamed for deepening distress, including one incident in which a Florida teen died by suicide in 2024 after extended conversations with a chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such incidents underscore the risks of emotionally responsive AI tools, said Todd Essig, a psychologist and founder and co-chair of the American Psychoanalytic Assn.’s Council on Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even after the most loving, empathic response, an AI doesn’t care if you drive to the store or drive off a cliff,” Essig said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI programs learn to mimic human responses, Essig said, so it’s up to the people building them to set clear limits and ensure they don’t cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

  &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When built with ethical frameworks and used under clinical supervision, tools like Xaia can support genuine therapeutic progress, functioning more like digital journals — a modern twist on the paper workbooks given to patients decades ago, said Jodi Halpern, a professor of bioethics and medical humanities at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many emotional support chatbots that aren’t clinically monitored are designed to mimic intimacy and build emotional bonds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People can experience the app as another,” Halpern said. “But it’s not actually giving them real-life experiences with other humans that are important for developing the healthy, mutually empathic curiosity that people need to participate in complex human relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halpern noted there is a difference between clinically approved mental health tools and those with no oversight. She and others are supporting a California bill sponsored by state Sen. Steve Padilla (D-Chula Vista)  that would require companies developing mental health chatbots or apps to disclose whether their tools are clinically validated, regulated by the FDA or rely on generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liran said he and his partners are aware of the limitations and have built in guardrails to keep the chatbot from saying anything harmful or inappropriate. For example, one arm of the AI generates the response, and another instantly double-checks it to make sure it’s safe before letting it through to the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not just opening it up to the public,” Liran said, pointing out that the guided therapy version on mobile and desktop is available only through a licensed clinician right now and Cedars is testing Xaia in multiple studies. “We’re trying to be very careful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 14-person study, patients using Xaia with mild or moderate anxiety or depression opened up about a variety of topics, including a mother who passed away and fear of being laid off. For a patient who had been having night sweats since a breakup, Xaia asked to hear more about what made the relationship feel unresolved and how it affected the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the patients still preferred the nuance and responsiveness of a human therapist, but the medical literature suggests patients are warming up to the idea of a nonhuman therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in PLOS Mental Health in February, participants were asked to compare responses written by licensed therapists and those generated by ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did many struggle to tell the difference, they consistently rated the AI’s replies as more empathic, culturally sensitive and emotionally engaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xaia’s creators see the tool as an extension of the patient-therapist relationship. It’s the kind of thing that might be useful if someone needs mental health support in the middle of the night or between sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still need therapists — humans — to look other humans in the eye to have conversations about vulnerable topics,” Spiegel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, “it’s not practical to simply bury our head in the sand and say we shouldn’t do this, because AI is everywhere,” he said. “We’ll be brushing our teeth with AI before long.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxQNEtKTEF6ekRYX3hHUFpaOHdXdERDdE9UQVZwRGhQUUpFbzYxT1VKeHRMMkhUMXE1cHhpSWU3WUttY002dnhneHhEOEtoNVBDZHZyZzIwNldYX3Y1ZVVnUUNBREpaUlZpV2Y3eE92OUJQSHp6QzVsNmZxVUZNaVludmVtQnU5cTBSUnJOallIQnJYOENFcFgxSVFuUExFY09CdTRDamw2MHE1VTF4UW5EcHdvODRzWWdUclM4MzFB</guid></item><item><title>自然提升GLP-1的终极肠道健康杂货清单- MindBodyGreen | The Ultimate Gut-Health Grocery List To Boost GLP-1 Naturally - MindBodyGreen</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSlZZZ0dmLUFjZ0hXQjROalFTbTFZUjdDR3dFSF9CNGctd195cm1sOC1iSzFqQzd3NF83RnZuem8xb3RieHo5REY5MkVadGxMd21faUJ4RjJiazdMdlhlVkh3eUl5MDMzLWFCRnVLN3FVeVFZZlFHbnVaZXFhT1pQN09yZElyd1JLeWFSNVZsODZwUFVCT19DdW5zOFI5Mlk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span id="content"&gt;&lt;div end="false" class="sc-11rlt5o-4 gjIquG"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While weight loss shots dominate headlines, what if your kitchen already contains the ingredients needed to activate your body's own GLP-1 production? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MindBodyGreen</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 09:21:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSlZZZ0dmLUFjZ0hXQjROalFTbTFZUjdDR3dFSF9CNGctd195cm1sOC1iSzFqQzd3NF83RnZuem8xb3RieHo5REY5MkVadGxMd21faUJ4RjJiazdMdlhlVkh3eUl5MDMzLWFCRnVLN3FVeVFZZlFHbnVaZXFhT1pQN09yZElyd1JLeWFSNVZsODZwUFVCT19DdW5zOFI5Mlk</guid></item><item><title>拿骚县发行的狂犬病迫在眉睫的公共卫生威胁-新闻12 | Imminent public health threat for rabies issued in Nassau County - News 12</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPRVR6NFMwUHEtNmVyTHVoNHdtQUUzQnFWN0padmlyUElxa2RHT0NqQzRuRXVuYmJLelJjR2hObnItNE4zX185WHdoZDFQWjN3WEtnOXFjVFpZSEc3RG5ySDFaczRlQXV0SnY1dnY5WElweS1vTXRhalBhU2ZHcDZwc09jd0pjWDM2TmRFbF9HOUgzVnhsZEgyaUR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div alignitems="normal" justifycontent="normal" direction="column" gap="1rem,1.25rem" flexwrap="nowrap" class="sc-fsYfdN hQgjIe sc-e6358465-0 dxMubp"&gt;&lt;p class="block"&gt;Nassau County health officials are sounding the alarm and issuing an imminent public health threat due to the spread of rabies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The Nassau County Health Department reports that there have been 25 positive rabies tests since last July. This marks the worst the situation has been in nearly a decade, since the county announced it had eradicated terrestrial rabies in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Most of the cases in Nassau are among raccoons and feral cats, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="block"&gt;&lt;a href="https://longisland.news12.com/health-officials-sixth-rabid-raccoon-found-in-amityville-area-this-year"&gt;In May, the Suffolk County Health Department &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;said it had identified six positive rabies cases in raccoons and all in Amityville. News 12 reached out early this morning for an update on rabies statistics in Suffolk County but has not yet heard back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="adobe-dc-view-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Health officials say avoid feeding or touching wild animals or stray cats and dogs, make sure your pets are up to date on their rabies vaccinations and keep pets indoors at night. Anyone who is bitten or scratched by an animal should seek immediate medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Rabies is a serious viral disease that affects the nervous system in mammals, including humans. While preventable by quickly vaccinating after an exposure, it is almost always fatal once symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Last Friday, the state Health Department issued a warning and urged New Yorkers to take steps to prevent rabies infections during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Rabid animals have been found in all counties in New York, officials said. Last year, the state's Wadsworth Center Rabies Laboratory confirmed rabies in 313 wild and domestic animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Nassau Health Commissioner Dr. Irina Gelman will hold a media availability to discuss the rabies declaration issued by the Health Department today at the Theodore Roosevelt Executive and Legislative Building in Mineola at 11 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 09:10:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPRVR6NFMwUHEtNmVyTHVoNHdtQUUzQnFWN0padmlyUElxa2RHT0NqQzRuRXVuYmJLelJjR2hObnItNE4zX185WHdoZDFQWjN3WEtnOXFjVFpZSEc3RG5ySDFaczRlQXV0SnY1dnY5WElweS1vTXRhalBhU2ZHcDZwc09jd0pjWDM2TmRFbF9HOUgzVnhsZEgyaUR3</guid></item><item><title>睡眠不好？哥伦比亚大学的研究人员建议您改变饮食习惯- upi.com | Not sleeping well?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;ST. PAUL, Minn., July 22 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; A top U.S. nutrition researcher is translating her expertise on the connections between diet, better sleep and heart health from the pages of dry academic journals into a colorful mass-market cookbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marie-Pierre St-Onge, a professor of nutritional medicine at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, along with recipe expert Kat Craddock, have chronicled dozens of recipes and lay out a 28-day meal plan designed for better sleep health in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://marie-pierrest-onge.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Eat Better, Sleep Better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, published by Simon &amp;amp; Schuster earlier this year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St-Onge in recent years has published studies exploring various angles of the connection between what we eat and how we sleep -- a field that remains poorly understood even as doctors &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2023/11/06/Want-to-slow-aging-Essential-Eight-checklist-holds-the-key-study-suggests/7681699211310/" target="_blank"&gt;have named&lt;/a&gt; lack of proper sleep as one the top risk factors for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her work has mainly centered on examining the relationship between sleep, weight management and cardiometabolic disease risk. She has also performed well-received research on "functional foods," or foods that offer health benefits, and on how ingredients affect weight management and cardiovascular disease risk prevention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with &lt;i&gt;Eat Better, Sleep Better&lt;/i&gt;, she and Craddock have produced an elegant, 288-page cookbook packed with 75 recipes meant to give users an opportunity to shape their diets around foods that promote better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, it prioritizes protein sources that are rich in tryptophan, the amino acid that serves as the building block for the sleep-regulating hormones melatonin and serotonin. Tryptophan, of course, is found in turkey and is famous for producing drowsiness after a full Thanksgiving Day dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the book goes well beyond that, highlighting several other ingredients tied to healthier sleep, such as omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in salmon; complex carbohydrates found in oats and buckwheat; and spices like ginger and turmeric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the book's recipe for savory lamb stew notes that lamb is exceptionally high in tryptophan and is also an excellent source of several essential nutrients, including zinc and vitamin B6, "two of the four essential nutrients involved in the body's production of serotonin and melatonin."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the recipe for chia pudding identifies tiny chia seeds as "a sleep-supporting superfood," not only rich in protein and tryptophanm but also in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, magnesium, fiber, complex carbohydrates, vitamin B6 and zinc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St-Onge told UPI one of her main goals with &lt;i&gt;Eat Better, Sleep Better&lt;/i&gt; is to translate her scientific research on sleep into a more popular format at at time when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data-research/facts-stats/adults-sleep-facts-and-stats.html" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 40% of U.S. adults are getting insufficient sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We do all this work and always publish it just in scientific journals, and my book agent said, 'But the public wants to know, too, it should be something that's available for them as well,' and I thought, he kind of has a point," she said. "We need to disseminate the work that we do, the findings that we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Especially in this day and age when the work that we do is funded entirely from taxpayer dollars or donor dollars, if we're talking about the American Heart Association, and it's really a return on their investment -- the knowledge that we can impart to them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St-Onge said she also finds that nutritionists sometimes have a misconception about the ability of people to translate esoteric facts about micronutrients into real-world diets, especially if it means changing those diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you're saying eat more plant protein or eat more fiber, they'll ask, 'Where can I find fiber and plant protein?' And I'll say, well, buckwheat is a great grain. 'Buckwheat? What's that? And how I am going to put it to use in my own diet?'
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I thought it was wonderful that I able to get paired with Kat, my co-author, who is in the food world and the recipe development world, and talking more about the application of nutrition in real life. I like recipes, and I also like to cook, but I've never been trained in recipe development or anything like that. So it was nice to be able to be part of that process."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craddock would develop the recipes and send them to St-Onge, who would then try them at home and offer some additional suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons there's a need for a sleep-centered cookbook is because it's not just what's eaten before bedtime that affects the quality of sleep, but rather what's consumed throughout the whole day, and over even longer periods, that counts in the body's ability to make melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're saying sleep is complicated, it's not just about what happens at night, it's about what happens during the day," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the background of it all is the risk that poor sleep poses to heart health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association in 2022 added sleep to its list of "Life's Essential 8," the eight top markers for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health, calling proper sleep "vital to your heart and brain health."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That assessment is shared by Dr. Kin M. Yuen, spokesperson for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and a sleep medicine specialist at UCSF Health in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A balanced diet with a healthy amount of lean protein, carbohydrates, including fruits and vegetables, starches and healthy fats, along with nuts and seeds -- for those without allergies -- is the most optimal" for healthy sleep, she told UPI in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, she added, sleep specialists support their nutritionist and cardiology colleagues in advocating for a diet that may include plant based protein, leafy greens and lean animal proteins, such as chicken, fish and seafood, depending on the individual's sensitivity and tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuen said it's also important for people with sensitivities or intolerances to specific substances to avoid or limit those food groups, as they may disturb or fragment sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Therefore, those with lactose intolerance may have better sleep by ingesting fewer dairy products or using lactose-free dairy only," she said. "For those with diagnosed celiac disease or gluten sensitivities, sleep may be improved without gluten in their diet, which may cause bloating, stomach upset or nausea, and sometimes weight loss."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, she cautioned, no one diet plan works for everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Individual differences and allergic tendencies may limit the intake of a particular food group. Viral, bacterial illness and antibiotic use may make a regular diet not feasible," Yuen warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, "good sleep and healthy diets go very well together," she concluded. "Adequate exercise also ensures sleep quality is optimized. Adequate daytime sunlight and devoting enough time to sleep will help ensure that the quality of sleep is optimal."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial changed Shayna Bhalla’s life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After years with long Covid — debilitated by fatigue, headaches, and neurological issues — her symptoms dramatically receded. While not fully back to her pre-Covid-19 baseline, she was able to resume university classes and other daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the last few months, I have literally regained life,” Bhalla said in an interview last November.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhalla posted on social media about her experience, garnering attention from other people with long Covid who hoped they could benefit from the same drug: an infusion called BC 007 (or rovunaptabin). Berlin Cures, the company that developed this drug, had repurposed it from heart disease research, hypothesizing that it could alleviate symptoms by reducing autoantibodies — immune system components that mistakenly attack the body as if it is an outside invader.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to posts like Bhalla’s and coverage in German media, the international long Covid community closely followed Berlin Cures’ trial, with many people expressing high hopes for its results in patient support groups and forums. The trial was a rare double-blind study of a novel drug, at a time when &lt;a href="https://thesicktimes.org/2024/03/26/want-to-enroll-in-a-long-covid-clinical-trial-this-new-project-helps-track-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;most long Covid research&lt;/a&gt; is still observational. Even the National Institutes of Health’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/31/long-covid-nih-recover-initiative-falls-short-on-causes-treatments/"&gt;$1.6 billion RECOVER initiative&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/09/long-covid-nih-trials/"&gt;primarily tested behavioral changes&lt;/a&gt; in its trials so far rather than pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But then, in November 2024, Berlin Cures &lt;a href="https://www.berlincures.com/en/news/phase-2-long-covid-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted a press release&lt;/a&gt; saying the Phase 2 clinical trial had been unsuccessful. Furthermore, Berlin Cures was out of funding and would not conduct additional research, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Bhalla was devastated: “I feel like I’m back at zero,” she said. She and other trial participants who spoke to The Sick Times&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;expressed disappointment that such a highly anticipated study had ended so abruptly. BC 007 was a rare compound that had led to clear symptom improvements for some participants — and it was suddenly unavailable for patients or future research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The BC 007 trial exemplifies the challenges of developing long Covid treatments. A review of the trial by&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The Sick Times shows that from the start, the study failed to account for the vast complexity of long Covid. Rather than testing the infusion on a specific group of patients who were likely to benefit, the Berlin Cures researchers used an unreliable blood test to select participants and failed to rigorously measure symptom changes, among other potential study design issues, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://longcovidjustice.org/what-is-long-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Long Covid&lt;/a&gt;, which has affected &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03173-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;around 6% to 7%&lt;/a&gt; of adults globally, is an umbrella term for a cluster of diseases with different patterns of symptoms. Scientists agree that no treatment will be a universal cure. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlin Cures’ drug might be a promising treatment for some people with long Covid and related chronic diseases, said Artur Fedorowski, a cardiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm who specializes in dysautonomia and has researched similar interventions. But the company’s recent trial was not set up properly to capture that promise, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more accurate results, experts like Fedorowski say trials must carefully choose their participants, match potential interventions to symptoms and biological measurements, and monitor outcomes in close collaboration with the people participating. Indeed, another study also looking at BC 007 utilized more suitable selection criteria and outcomes measures — and those researchers did find the infusion helped alleviate participants’ symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Sick Times has learned that BC 007 may yet have a future. In an interview this summer, sharing the first news about this drug since late 2024, former Berlin Cures CEO Oliver von Stein said he is leading a new startup, called APTA Therapeutics, that has acquired the prior company’s assets and is planning further research in collaboration with long Covid and related disease experts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We do want to give patients hope that this drug will continue in its clinical development path,” von Stein said. He acknowledged that Berlin Cures’ Phase 2 trial was “not an optimum study in design” and said that future research will learn from its shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-selecting-patients-with-an-unreliable-biomarker"&gt;Selecting patients with an unreliable biomarker&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlin Cures, a biotech company based in Germany, spent over two decades focused on developing treatments for autoantibodies. Its scientists designed the drug BC 007 to treat chronic heart failure; a clinical trial completed in 2018 &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40261-020-00903-9?form=MG0AV3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;found the infusion safe&lt;/a&gt; and capable of neutralizing a specific type of autoantibody that blocks G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GPCRs are important molecules involved with many different functions in the body, explained Bornali Bhattacharjee, who has studied how long Covid impacts the immune system as associate director of Yale University’s Center for Infection and Immunity. These receptors act as signals in many different biological pathways; if those pathways are interrupted by rogue autoantibodies, it can lead to malfunctioning circulatory and nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06651-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Prior research&lt;/a&gt; from Bhattacharjee and her colleagues at Yale has found that some people with long Covid have malfunctioning GPCRs. Before the pandemic, researchers found similar GPCR issues in people with &lt;a href="https://longcovidjustice.org/dysautonomia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)&lt;/a&gt;, a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that many have developed following Covid-19. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Federowski said the trial should have homed in on participants with post-Covid POTS, given the prior research showing the connections between this condition and GPCR autoantibodies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berlin Cures became interested in long Covid as patient numbers quickly grew. In fall 2021, researchers from Berlin Cures and the University Hospital Erlangen &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8637609/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published a case report&lt;/a&gt; about one individual with long Covid who experienced “successful healing” from a single infusion of BC 007. The patient’s fatigue and other symptoms improved significantly, according to that paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following more successful case studies at University Hospital Erlangen, the medical institution and Berlin Cures each embarked on &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05911009" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Phase 2 clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; starting in summer 2023. To select participants with GPCR autoantibodies, both studies used a test, which was performed by Berlin Cures, looking at circulatory system cells called cardiomyocytes. Then, the researchers used that same test to examine how well the BC 007 infusion worked in neutralizing autoantibodies. But this test may have been unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are no good studies demonstrating that there’s a difference between patients and healthy controls in how the plasma makes cardiomyocytes respond,” Fedorowski said. He would have liked to see the scientists use blood cell tests that have been validated by other research groups. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Study participants also noticed inconsistencies in the test. “Multiple people got screened at multiple screening sites multiple times,” said Claudia, another participant in the Berlin Cures trial. (Besides Bhalla, this story uses pseudonyms for other trial participants to preserve their privacy.)&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;People with long Covid went to different trial sites “until they finally got a positive result” so that they could participate, she said. “Which means that the [autoantibodies] are either not always present in the blood, or the test is flawed and can’t always measure them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-failing-to-measure-success"&gt;Failing to measure success&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Outside of the autoantibody test, the Berlin Cures study did not focus on specific symptoms or characteristics within &lt;a href="https://thesicktimes.org/2024/06/18/new-nasem-reports-offer-broad-definition-highlight-the-seriousness-of-long-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;long Covid’s broad definition&lt;/a&gt;. According to the study’s &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05911009#participation-criteria" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;listing on ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;, any adult who reported “chronic fatigue” and “at least one additional symptom” following a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection was eligible to participate. The study initially focused on people who had long Covid for less than a year, then expanded to include those who had been sick for longer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To identify people with chronic fatigue and later track potential improvements, the trial used fatigue questions from a symptom survey called the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT). While fatigue is a common long Covid symptom, for many people with the disease, it’s not actually the best factor to track: Rather, researchers recommend evaluating &lt;a href="https://longcovidjustice.org/PEM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;post-exertional malaise&lt;/a&gt;, or PEM, which is a state of new or worsened symptoms following activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PEM can include many symptoms and signs — not just fatigue but also pain, sleep problems, cognitive issues, muscle weakness, flu-like symptoms, and more. It’s a cardinal feature of &lt;a href="https://longcovidjustice.org/what-is-ME/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)&lt;/a&gt;, a chronic disease for which many people with long Covid meet the diagnostic criteria. ME researchers have identified surveys and tests that accurately track PEM, but FACIT is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not only does the FACIT survey fail to capture PEM, it can’t determine differences in severity, said Chloé de Canson, a patient-researcher with long Covid who closely follows clinical trials. A participant could regain the ability to cook for themselves or work part-time, but “not see improvement on this outcome measure” if they still feel “tired,” de Canson said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this was the case for Bhalla, the Berlin Cures trial participant who experienced dramatic improvement following the infusion. Participant Emma, too, reported that her symptoms improved somewhat following the infusions but that it was “challenging” for her to answer the survey questions accurately because they didn’t match her experience with PEM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Berlin Cures trial also required long, in-depth visits to medical institutions without protection from potential infection with SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens. People with long Covid often request that medical centers &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/stanford-conducting-long-covid-study-011047369.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;take safety measures &lt;/a&gt;such as requiring high-quality masks, as &lt;a href="https://thesicktimes.org/2024/02/13/covid-19-reinfections-are-further-disabling-people-with-long-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reinfection can worsen their symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emma didn’t see any staff masking during her visits, she said: “Honestly, I felt that there were zero precautions made and no consciousness present.” Another participant, Lisa, said the nurses “generally did not wear masks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in-person visits to medical centers can themselves cause post-exertional malaise, potentially interfering with the effects of a treatment. Multiple participants noted that the Berlin Cures study required long hours for every appointment, on top of travel. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are so many things that went wrong in this trial that it’s not surprising to us that it failed,” said Claudia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Von Stein, appointed as Berlin Cures’ CEO in June 2023 after years of experience in developing nucleic-acid–based drugs like BC 007, agreed that the trial likely included too broad a group of patients and did not use the best &lt;a href="https://toolkit.ncats.nih.gov/glossary/endpoint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;endpoints&lt;/a&gt; to capture symptom improvement. The trial didn’t fail because the drug “doesn’t perform” for some people with long Covid, he said. Rather, “we had a disappointing outcome, I would like to believe, most likely [because] we did not have an optimum patient selection program in place.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a common challenge for Phase 2 trials, particularly for complex diseases like long Covid, von Stein said. “Going forward now, the lessons learned here must be that we must pay great attention to the patient selection, really try to specify who we think is best to enter these trials, so that we can really come to a meaningful clinical endpoint,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-promising-results-in-a-separate-study"&gt;More promising results in a separate study&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Berlin Cures study, a second trial at University Hospital Erlangen did find that BC 007 alleviated symptoms. Researchers reported their results in a preprint &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.13.24318856v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted to medRxiv in December 2024&lt;/a&gt;: Participants found “significant improvement” for fatigue and PEM following infusions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it was a smaller study — comprising 30 people, compared to 119 in Berlin Cures’ trial — the Erlangen trial was more effective in selecting a subset of participants likely to benefit from the drug and tracking their outcomes, outside experts said. (The study has not been peer-reviewed as of July.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Erlangen researchers sought to test BC 007’s safety among an “autoimmune subgroup” of people with long Covid. Alongside a positive test for GPCR autoantibodies, the criteria included a past confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, a score in the moderate to severe range on an ME scale, and at least three out of a longer list of common symptoms. The researchers also excluded people with documented organ damage from Covid-19, which some &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2828329" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; may represent a different subset of people with long Covid from those who meet the criteria for ME.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to the more specific selection criteria, the Erlangen trial used several different symptom surveys to capture outcomes, including some designed and validated for people with ME. Results using these ME surveys showed that BC 007 led to significant improvements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have any long Covid–specific validated instruments,” Bhattacharjee said, so it’s best to use multiple tests together and capture a range of data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another advantage for participants in the Erlangen study was that the trial utilized a crossover design: All 30 patients received BC 007. One group received first the drug, then a placebo, while the other received first the placebo, then the drug. In their preprint, the researchers wrote that their results suggest BC 007 should be tested in a larger group of patients who meet similar criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Von Stein said the Erlangen study has “promising signals” for future research. He also noted this study’s selection criteria and endpoints as potential reasons why it reported different outcomes from Berlin Cures’ trial.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;With Berlin Cures’ assets transferred to the new company, APTA Therapeutics, von Stein plans to commission a more complete analysis of the Phase 2 trial’s data, hopefully later published in a scientific paper. “I think we have an obligation to tell the world, what was the output from the [trial]?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with that analysis, APTA will work with the Erlangen researchers and other specialist university clinics in the E.U. focused on long Covid and related diseases to further study BC 007 in small cohorts, eventually compiling enough data for a larger trial with a more robust design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The hope is maybe within 18 months … to have enough robust data that could form the basis of a registration study [Phase 3 trial], where we’ve teased out a lot of these unknowns and thereby really maximize the chance of getting this drug to market,” von Stein said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to designing studies themselves, finding funding for these trials has been a challenge, von Stein added. “I think in light of the impact that Covid has had globally, it’s quite disappointing to see that the level of financial support has been quite minimal” from governments like Germany’s, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-rigorous-selection-and-stratification"&gt;More rigorous selection and stratification&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The challenges that Berlin Cures faced in testing BC 007 among people with long Covid are familiar to researchers and patient-advocates who studied ME, POTS, and other similar complex chronic diseases before Covid-19 emerged. These researchers offer solutions: Clinical trials should carefully stratify their participants, and designing trials in collaboration with people who have lived experience is key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Helen Brownlie, a patient-researcher with ME in the U.K. who has followed clinical trials for decades, said the Berlin Cures saga reminded her of past ME trials. While ME has been researched in some form for nearly a century, the disease is under-prioritized by governments &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21641846.2022.2062169" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;compared to its burden on patients&lt;/a&gt;. There is no accepted biomarker or diagnostic test, and some researchers and advocates disagree about how to define it, especially when including people diagnosed with the older and broader term “chronic fatigue syndrome.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard in medical evidence, are designed for “when you have a well-delineated disorder, a well-established protocol for treating that disorder with a robust evidence base, and then a new drug that you want to compare” to the existing paradigm, Brownlie said. For ME, all of this is “nonexistent.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the challenge only intensifies with long Covid: People with the disease are generally unified in that all can trace their symptoms back to a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but beyond that, symptoms and potential biological mechanisms vary widely. Subgroups under the long Covid umbrella aren’t yet clearly defined, and long Covid also &lt;a href="https://thesicktimes.org/2025/01/21/finding-an-accepted-long-covid-biomarker-will-be-complicated-this-blood-test-could-give-us-answers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;lacks a diagnostic test or biomarker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But clinical trials are crucial, because millions of people are dealing with debilitating symptoms. For now, experts like Brownlie recommend smaller trials that match patients who meet a specific biological profile with treatments that are likely to help in their specific case. Rather than “take a broad brush,” researchers should “differentiate,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Patient-Led Research Collaborative (PLRC), a group of scientists who live with long Covid and have led foundational research into the disease, makes similar recommendations. In a &lt;a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PLRC-RFI-RECOVER-TLC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brief of clinical trial guidelines&lt;/a&gt; submitted in response to a request for information from the &lt;a href="https://thesicktimes.org/2024/10/01/a-good-step-long-covid-advocates-and-researchers-respond-to-the-recover-treating-long-covid-meeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;RECOVER-Treating Long Covid initiative&lt;/a&gt;, the group recommended “starting with smaller signal-finding trials” that can inform larger studies. Other leading long Covid researchers are thinking this way, too, as shown by recent talks at &lt;a href="https://thesicktimes.org/2025/07/09/live-blog-following-the-patient-led-research-fund-summer-2025-webinar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;symposia led by PLRC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://thesicktimes.org/2025/05/16/live-blog-following-the-spring-2025-polybio-symposium-on-long-covid-and-related-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PolyBio Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The collaborative also urges researchers to guard against post-exertional malaise. “All tests of all types should be considered that they may induce PEM, and methods to care for patients in the aftermath should be implemented,” PLRC recommended in their brief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, given &lt;a href="https://thesicktimes.org/2024/09/17/for-people-with-severe-long-covid-medical-care-is-out-of-reach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;how severe long Covid can be&lt;/a&gt; for some people, patient-advocates have called for &lt;a href="https://thesicktimes.org/2024/10/18/clinical-trials-explore-how-low-dose-naltrexone-could-help-people-with-long-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;decentralized study methods&lt;/a&gt;, in which medications and other supplies are mailed to participants, or where researchers travel to participants, rather than participants being made to come to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Above all, people with long Covid say that including their feedback in all stages of the scientific process will &lt;a href="https://thesicktimes.org/2024/04/02/how-patient-led-research-could-speed-up-medical-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;make for more effective studies&lt;/a&gt;. “I think that involving people with long Covid and ME/CFS directly in the planning stages would help ensure that the tools and methods used truly reflect our real-life experiences and challenges,” Berlin Cures participant Emma said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite all the challenges and disappointments of the Berlin Cures trial, participant Jakob said he “would do it again,” because taking part in trials “is the only way we can defeat this disease with new medication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dopamine is one of the most extensively studied chemical messengers in the human brain, and yet scientists are still figuring out how it works to accomplish so much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For years, the classic view has been that, when released, dopamine slowly diffuses through the brain like a chemical megaphone, broadcasting information far and wide to numerous target cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recently, however, that perspective has changed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2019.01.001"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Newer research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggests that dopamine is also capable of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41972-6"&gt;short&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-024-01803-8"&gt;sharp&lt;/a&gt; whispers, precisely directed within milliseconds to neighboring cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If researchers are right, this localized signal could be a "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adp9833"&gt;fundamental building block&lt;/a&gt;" that's overlooked in the brain's dopamine system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-seems-to-have-a-blocking-effect-on-dopamine-and-heres-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Caffeine Seems to Have a Blocking Effect on Dopamine, And Here's Why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine in the brain is different to dopamine in the rest of the body. In the blood, dopamine helps modulate the function of multiple organs as well as our immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the brain, it's a chemical messenger involved in mediating a diversity of animal behaviors &lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; from movement and mood to sleep and memory to reward and motivation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Neurons that release dopamine are known to do so with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adx6367"&gt;&lt;span&gt;different firing patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and yet it's not clear what messages these specific signals encode, or why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ability to send both fast &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; slow signals could explain how the brain's dopamine system can achieve so much with such specificity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168136" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168136" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-642x442.png" alt="Dopamin Pathway" class="size-medium wp-image-168136" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-642x442.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-603x415.png 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-768x529.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-1536x1058.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-600x413.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168136" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The main dopamine pathway in the brain.

B&lt;/span&gt;roader dopamine release, meanwhile, is widespread and elicits a slower response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our current research found that dopamine signaling and transmission in the brain is much more complex than we thought," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/new-discovery-reveals-dopamine-operates-with-surgical-precision-not-as-a-broad-signal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; pharmacologist Christopher Ford from the University of Colorado. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We knew that dopamine plays a role in many different behaviors, and our work gives the beginning of a framework for understanding how all those different behaviors could all be regulated by dopamine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The specific neurons studied by Ford and colleagues come from the brain's &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"&gt;&lt;span&gt;striatum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; – a part of the basal ganglia involved in motor and reward systems that is rich in dopamine-releasing neurons. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The striatum receives dopamine inputs from various parts of the brain, and it is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2018.12.004"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.06.033"&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-024-03165-7"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Parkinson's disease, for instance, is marked by a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-exactly-which-brain-cells-die-in-parkinson-s-disease"&gt;degeneration of dopamine neurons&lt;/a&gt; connecting to the striatum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of how dopamine sends signals in this part of the brain could be crucial for coming up with new treatments for a variety of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We are really only at the tip of the iceberg in trying to understand how dysfunctions in dopamine contribute to diseases like Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia or addiction," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/new-discovery-reveals-dopamine-operates-with-surgical-precision-not-as-a-broad-signal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Ford. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"More work is needed to grasp how these specific changes in dopamine signaling are affected in these different neurological and psychiatric diseases."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adp9833"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn’t the first time, and it certainly won’t be the last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I understood their concern. When you hear about diagnosis rates increasing dramatically – one study points to a &lt;a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="787% increase in autism diagnoses" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687e8bbce4b0502d85e5de4c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;787% increase in autism diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; between 1998 and 2018 – it’s natural to wonder if we’ve swung too far in the other direction. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But this perspective reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of what we’re actually witnessing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re not seeing an epidemic of neurodivergence. We’re witnessing the correction of decades of systematic oversight. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For generations, our diagnostic criteria were built around a narrow template that captured only the most obvious presentations, typically in boys. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We systematically missed girls who internalised and masked their differences, adults who developed sophisticated coping mechanisms, and anyone whose symptoms didn’t match the textbook examples from the 1980s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My friend Sarah was diagnosed with autism aged 37 after her daughter’s autism assessment. She’d spent decades thinking she was “sensitive”, “didn’t like big groups” and was even “antisocial”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; She had friends, a good career, but everything required enormous effort and left her exhausted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her childhood special interest in space was praised as academic brilliance. Her need for routine was seen as being “organised”. Her differences were invisible because she’d learned to mask them so perfectly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sid, who owns the café opposite me, was recently diagnosed with ADHD at 56. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a child, he wasn’t hyperactive in the classic sense. He was the daydreamer, the “underachiever”, the “classroom clown”, the one whose potential was always just out of reach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His inattention was dismissed as laziness rather than recognised as a neurological difference requiring specific support strategies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These aren’t new cases of autism or ADHD. These are people who have always been neurodivergent but lacked the framework to understand themselves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The apparent surge in diagnoses reflects our evolving understanding of how these conditions manifest across different populations, ages, and presentations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Critics worry about diagnostic inflation, but this concern often misses the point. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A meaningful diagnosis isn’t about assigning labels. It’s about providing understanding and opening doors to appropriate support. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When someone finally comprehends why traditional strategies never worked for them, why they’ve always felt different, or why they need specific accommodations, they’re not being harmed by recognition, they’re being empowered by knowledge. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They can now learn to understand themselves better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The parent who told me, “Everyone seems to have autism these days” was expressing a natural human tendency to notice patterns. But what they’re noticing isn’t an epidemic. It’s visibility. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People who once suffered in silence now have language for their experiences and pathways to support.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rather than questioning whether too many people are being recognised as neurodivergent, we should celebrate that fewer people are being overlooked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s not overdiagnosis.
