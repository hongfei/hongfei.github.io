                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — What do actress and comedian Kristen Wiig, President Donald Trump, journalist David Muir and a University of Utah biochemistry professor have in common? They were all listed among &lt;a href="https://time.com/collections/100-most-influential-people-2025/7273749/tomas-cihlar-and-wesley-sundquist/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Time magazine's 100&lt;/a&gt; most influential people in the world on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wesley Sundquist, co-chairman of the Department of Biochemistry at the U., is being recognized with his co-recipient, Tomas Cihlar, a virologist for Gilead Sciences, for their work that led to a first-of-its-kind HIV treatment and prevention drug lenacapavir. Time magazine recognized the pair for their decades of work that led to what scientific journal Science called &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2024#section_breakthrough" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Breakthrough of the Year&lt;/a&gt; in 2024: a twice-a-year injectable that has shown a nearly 100% efficacy rate in preventing HIV infection for at-risk individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was completely surprised when I got the call," said Sundquist, "but I feel like I'm representing a lot of people who have worked hard on this project ... so it was great (news)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundquist and his biochemistry lab were responsible for their work studying HIV capsids — the protein shell responsible for protecting and releasing the virus' genetic material — in the late '90s. They began by studying how HIV is built on a molecular level. They discovered that the capsid's structure is extremely sensitive, making it an ideal target for disrupting the virus' ability to infect human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery was passed on to collaborators like Cihlar at biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, who began researching drugs that targeted the HIV capsid. This eventually led to Gilead developing and manufacturing lenacapavir, known as its brand name &lt;a href="https://www.sunlenca.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Sunleca.&lt;/a&gt; Similar HIV treatment drugs are taken as a daily pill and work by targeting the virus after it enters the cell, but lenacapavir is a long-acting treatment that only requires an injection every six months and interferes with the infection process at an earlier stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundquist followed the drug's development as a consultant through the years. He says his research began as a way to contribute to the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was doing a (postdoctoral program) in Cambridge, England, and then typically you're hired to run your own lab, and you have to decide what the lab should work on," said Sunquist. "That was during the time when the death rate from HIV/AIDS was rising dramatically in the U.S., and there wasn't a clear end in sight. So the science interested me, but it was also clearly going to be a very important medical problem that needed lots of perspectives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death rate from AIDS, the most advanced stage of HIV, has reduced significantly in the U.S. since 1994, when it became the leading cause of death for Americans ages 25 to 44, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/history/hiv-and-aids-timeline#year-1994" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;federal website&lt;/a&gt; for HIV. But it still remains a prevalent issue &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/global-statistics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;around the world&lt;/a&gt;, especially in eastern and southern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilead is working on getting lenacapavir approved to be used as a pre-exposure prophylaxis — or PrEP — to prevent HIV contraction, since it is currently only approved to treat the virus. Clinical trials using the drug as PrEP were conducted in South Africa and Uganda, proving the drug to be successful in preventing HIV infection in almost 100% of at-risk participants, according to &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/us-fda-accepts-gileads-new-drug-applications-for-twice-yearly-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention-under-priority-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Gilead&lt;/a&gt;. The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing the drug applications under priority review and has a target action date of June 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there's every reason to expect that it will be very, very successful. The clinical trials certainly indicate that," said Sundquist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundquist doesn't spend as much time in the lab as he did early on in his career, but he confirmed that the university's biochemists are still working with the HIV capsid and studying other aspects of what viruses can teach scientists about cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Time's list of the most influential people in 2025 only formally recognized Sundquist and Cihlar for their work in HIV treatment and prevention, Sundquist says many others contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Working on hard problems takes time, and it takes support and a lot of people," he said. "I would say the most important contributions were made by graduate students and postdoctoral (students). ... I think that's important to emphasize that science is a team sport, and Gilead really deserves enormous credit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;What causes  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;? This severe mental illness, which affects &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schizophrenia"&gt;over 20 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and is characterised by recurrent hallucinations and delusions, often begins to emerge in the period from adolescence to early adulthood. It's a complex disorder that affects almost every area of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current theories about why schizophrenia develops &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36370183/"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; it may be linked to changes in brain development during this critical period of emerging adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is also &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/314464"&gt;thought to be similar&lt;/a&gt; to conditions such as dyslexia,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;), which are neurodevelopmental but usually manifest in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EvN7R1oRuOI?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124003585"&gt;our research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that accelerated brain ageing could be another potential driver in the development of schizophrenia – and this can be measured using a simple blood test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study is unique because we measured proteins in blood derived directly from brain neurons – the brain's nerve cells – in people suffering from schizophrenia. This protein, called neurofilament light protein (NfL), consists of long, thread-like structures that help maintain the size and shape of nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NfL is released into the blood and cerebrospinal fluid when brain neurons are damaged or undergo neurodegeneration. Its release when these cells are damaged makes it a &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/14/11624"&gt;useful biomarker&lt;/a&gt; for diagnosing and monitoring neurodegenerative diseases and neurological damage. Measuring the levels of NfL can also provide insight into the extent of neuronal injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal injury is damage or harm to neurons, the specialised cells in the nervous system essential for communication in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. When neurons are injured, their ability to function properly is impaired, which can result in a range of neurological symptoms depending on the severity and location of the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raised levels of NfL have been associated with a range of neurological conditions including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, multiple sclerosis,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease and frontotemporal dementia. But NfL levels also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37511382/"&gt;normally increase with age&lt;/a&gt; as these proteins lose the ability to repair themselves as effectively. This is due to a combination of factors including gradual wear-and-tear on neurons over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reductions in the brain's grey matter, white matter and connectivity are all part of normal, healthy ageing, these changes are usually gradual and not disabling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey matter contains most of the brain's neurons and is responsible for processing information, memory, decision-making, muscle control, and seeing and hearing. White matter is the long fibres that connect different brain regions, allowing them to communicate quickly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noticeable symptoms of normal, healthy brain ageing might include a bit more forgetfulness, slower reaction time, and difficulty juggling multiple tasks. Such changes are very different from the patterns seen in illnesses like schizophrenia where, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/40/5/1140/1924488"&gt;our study shows&lt;/a&gt;, the decline is faster and more severe, indicating an older brain age than would be expected from the patient's chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IIFPUpqS5dc?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research found that, in people with schizophrenia, NfL levels appeared to increase more quickly with age, compared with the rate of increase in healthy people, indicating an acceleration of the brain ageing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also studied samples from people suffering from bipolar disorder, which did not show the same accelerated increase. Data from &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-022-00330-z"&gt;other methods&lt;/a&gt;, such as calculating "brain age" from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans, also points to accelerated brain ageing in people with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people suffering from schizophrenia, accelerated ageing of the body is already a serious problem, as Christos Pantelis, a Melbourne psychiatrist and senior author of our study, explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important problem is that people with chronic schizophrenia are often exposed to an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7796511/#abstract1"&gt;unhealthy lifestyle overall&lt;/a&gt;. They can experience isolation, unemployment, lack of physical activities, smoking – and many resort to illicit drug use that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/cannabis-increased-schizophrenia-risk-in-young-people-linked-to-both-low-and-high-use-175463"&gt;can make their condition worse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, people diagnosed with schizophrenia have &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/10/12/2366"&gt;a life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; 20-30 years shorter than the average. This is mainly due to earlier development of common age-related diseases such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="158451" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/45/12/987/7611764"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/schizophrenia"&gt;Around half&lt;/a&gt; of people with schizophrenia have at least one other chronic medical condition, such as obesity, respiratory conditions, chronic pain and substance-use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with schizophrenia have &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK571451/"&gt;a higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of substance-use disorders due to a combination of biological, psychological and environmental factors. These include self-medication for distressing symptoms, impaired cognitive function, social isolation, and difficulties with treatment adherence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lifestyle is a factor in the accelerated ageing of the body for those living with schizophrenia, our study could prove another important step in understanding – and in time, treating – this distressing disease.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/239979/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

The drugs also had the added benefit of keeping them quiet. They didn’t necessarily need to take the tablets at weekends or during the holidays – the aim was to improve their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs were also viewed as a temporary fix. The children might take them for a few months or a couple of years, but as they aged and their behaviour improved, they would stop taking them – usually by the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, today this has all changed. The number of children diagnosed with ADHD has surged, with diagnoses for boys doubling since 2000, and tripling for girls over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There has also been a sea change in how the condition is understood. No longer is it viewed as a temporary behaviour issue, but as a lifelong condition which requires constant, often daily, medical treatment for years, if not for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Joanna Moncrieff began her career as an NHS psychiatrist more than 30 years ago, and says she has grown more concerned about the number of children on stimulant pills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Studies now show that ADHD stimulants do not help children perform better in school&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, nearly 250,000 people in England received ADHD prescriptions on the NHS – a more than threefold rise from 81,000 in 2015. Of those, more than 60,000 are children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I am not a child psychiatrist, but I have spent my career doing research into drug treatments for all sorts of mental health problems. And over the years I have grown increasingly concerned about the number of children on these stimulant pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the main problems is that children do not like taking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A US study, which asked children on stimulants how the pills made them feel, found they regularly described the drugs making them feel ‘numb’ or ‘sad’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some described how, while on stimulants, they ‘don’t smile’ or ‘feel like myself’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then there are the physical consequences to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another US study found that children on stimulants were, on average, 1.5in (4cm) shorter than their peers who also had ADHD but were not taking the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite these side-effects, many psychiatrists who prescribe the tablets – both on the NHS and privately – say those consequences are a necessary evil. This is because, they argue, the pills help children perform better in school and, ultimately, have brighter futures as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, growing research has thrown this justification into question. Studies now show that ADHD stimulants do not help children perform better in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is why I, and an increasing number of my colleagues, believe we need to think again about the rising use of these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So how did we get here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS defines ADHD as a condition where the brain works differently to most people. Children diagnosed with it are often those who have trouble concentrating or sitting still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-91c5cc20-1d25-11f0-b008-49fe5fdecb05" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14627875/children-ADHD-drugs-stunt-growth-psychiatrist-Joanna-Moncrieff.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;What is ADHD?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a behavioural condition defined by inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It affects around five per cent of children in the US. Some 3.6 per cent of boys and 0.85 per cent of girls suffer in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms typically appear at an early age and become more noticeable as a child grows. These can also include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Constant fidgeting &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Poor concentration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Excessive movement or talking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Acting without thinking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Inability to deal with stress &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Little or no sense of danger &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Careless mistakes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Mood swings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Forgetfulness &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Difficulty organising tasks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt; Continually starting new tasks before finishing old ones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Inability to listen or carry out instructions &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most cases are diagnosed between six and 12 years old. Adults can also suffer, but there is less research into this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ADHD's exact cause is unclear but is thought to involve genetic mutations that affect a person's brain function and structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Premature babies and those with epilepsy or brain damage are more at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ADHD is also linked to anxiety, depression, insomnia, Tourette's and epilepsy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A combination of medication and therapy is usually recommended to relieve symptoms and make day-to-day life easier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Source: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;NHS Choices &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other common symptoms, according to the Health Service, include being easily distracted, making impulsive decisions and finding it hard to listen to what people are saying or to follow instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This definition of ADHD has long been contested. Many, like myself, point out that you would be hard-pressed to find a child who didn’t show several of these symptoms at one time or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no blood test or scan you can take to get an ADHD diagnosis. So it’s left completely up to the judgment of the doctor to decide whether a patient has it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent research also shows that symptoms fluctuate, meaning children show them at some times and not others. This flies in the face of the idea that ADHD is a lifelong condition originating in a different sort of brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But another contentious issue is the drugs that are used to treat it, which have remained largely the same for nearly 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first research into treating ADHD dates back to 1937, when an American psychiatrist experimented with giving children with behavioural issues a daily dose of the stimulant drug amphetamine (then known as benzedrine).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time the drug was used by factory workers to help them get through long shifts filled with repetitive tasks. Today, the same substance is taken by recreational drug-takers and is better known by its street name, speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the study, which earlier this month was highlighted in The New York Times, concluded that benzedrine had a ‘spectacular’ effect on problem children. According to their teachers, many children showed ‘remarkably improved school performance’ and, overnight, became ‘placid and easygoing’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is this research which has paved the way for millions of prescriptions of these stimulant drugs to be given to children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most popular stimulant to be prescribed to children with ADHD is methylphenidate, also known by its brand name Ritalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in recent years, studies have called into question the benefits of stimulants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One such study, published in 2022, involved children aged seven to 12 attending a two-month summer camp in the US. Half their time was spent doing classroom learning. Researchers randomly split the children into two groups. Half received a daily dose of Ritalin, while the other half were given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While in the classroom, the children taking Ritalin appeared to work faster and were better behaved than those on the placebo. However, at the end of the teaching periods, the two groups underwent tests and the results showed that the children on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ritalin hadn’t learnt any more than their non-drugged campmates. The drugs don’t improve the brain function of ADHD patients, they simply change behaviour temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Teachers and parents see hard-working, quiet children. The children may feel they are doing better too, but as the research shows, the drugs do not improve their performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are also the long-term consequences of these pills to consider. We already know that they can stunt growth, and even delay puberty in boys. There are also worries that, in rare cases, stimulants can damage the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But I am also concerned that stimulants might negatively affect children’s personality development. Children who act out need to learn to be responsible for their actions. If they are told they are sick and can only be normal with the help of medication, they may never learn how to control their own behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, it’s true that many children do have attention problems and struggle in school. The number getting mobile phones has probably only made this issue worse. Some children find a large institution like school difficult. They find the work boring and don’t feel they fit in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often, when children diagnosed with ADHD leave school and find something that interests and motivates them, they do really well. This suggests it’s the environment that’s the problem, not the child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I wouldn’t like to say that no child should ever be prescribed stimulants, but it seems wrong that we are having to give children drugs to enable them to fit into modern-day life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;I hated how these drugs made me feel - but I'd have failed my exams without their help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;It was the summer of 2014, I was deep into A-level revision and my mornings &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;all began the same way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;After breakfast I would take two small, white pills. By the time I had showered, my heart would be beating so fast it felt like it was going to burst out of my chest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;But I’d ignore this and sit at my desk, where I’d often stay for four or five hours at a time, not even getting up to go to the toilet or eat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The pills were Ritalin, a stimulant ADHD medication I had been prescribed two years previously. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;As a child I’d been quiet and well-behaved. However, at 14 things changed drastically when my parents’ divorce threw home life into chaos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;I would skip school, argue with teachers and disrupt lessons. When I could be convinced to sit still, my mind wandered and I’d spend more time doodling than doing any work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Six months before my GCSEs (pictured left), I was on course to fail them all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;In desperation, my parents took me to see a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with ADHD and prescribed Ritalin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The idea was to take them every day, but I quickly found that was impossible. When I took them at school, my concentration on tasks would improve, but I also found it challenging to talk or write essays. It was as though the pills dulled my creativity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;They also made me anxious, and anti-social, and took away my appetite. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;But I discovered the best way to use them: revision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Previously, revising for exams was so boring that I couldn’t manage it. But on Ritalin it became the most fascinating and important task in the world, and I managed to gain decent grades in my exams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;At A-level, being able to pick my subjects meant I’d begun to enjoy school – particularly English. However, feeling the pressure to get the grades &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;I needed for my university of choice, Edinburgh, I turned again to Ritalin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;These revision days passed in a haze, where I was unable to talk or eat very much at all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;However, the tactic paid off. I got top marks and gained a university place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;That was the last time I took Ritalin. It had helped me, but I hated the way it made me feel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The experience also made me realise that it was within my own abilities to sit down and revise. So I decided to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;go drug-free at university.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;More than a decade on, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;I often forget that I was once labelled with ADHD. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;I work long hours and find my job incredibly engaging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;While I’m thankful that the drugs helped get me through exams, I firmly believe my behaviour problems were a temporary issue triggered by what was going on at home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;And, eventually, I simply outgrew that behaviour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 00:24:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQem9aeEVoREJOU3hEUVd4RmpmZ0NOV3NNRWlWelprUzlwUWVDOUM2X2ZvSWk0QmlHcVlsaVdBdTNuak9Jc0xWUEdOQWhRcjdVNmZKcmFoZ3ZTV2RIcWVJZWVCSVhMdlEwekRqamQ2UVJ6TmtNSDd0OVRNalpjUHhhZDFRbnVhelBrR0Z1UlNjOXBqZlFBQzhUb0hBbVJHeXVkTWVHVnk2MU1pRGgwRERoTGk0RGVmYWo4WUFr</guid></item><item><title>发现癌症治愈方法？研究人员发现这种药物可以治愈这种可怕的疾病-印度时报 | Cancer cure found?

Now, according to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2025.1490621/full" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in Frontiers in Oncology, it seems that scientists have reached a consensus that medical cannabis can play a vital role in cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Castle, the lead author of the study and the research director at the Whole Health Oncology Institute, stated that the study intended to finally solidify the agreement of cannabis' potential as a cancer treatment. “Our goal was to determine the scientific consensus on the topic of medical cannabis, a field that has long been dominated by a war between cherry-picked studies,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by Cancer Playbook in cooperation with the Whole House Oncology Institute to collect, analyse and share data on patient-reported outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study on cannabis and cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at more than 10,000 studies related to medical cannabis and cancer. This large-scale research surpasses the scale of any previous study in the field. To move beyond bias–conscious or not–it was essential to use a large-scale, radically inclusive methodology based on mathematical reasoning,” said Castle. “We wanted to analyse not just a handful, but nearly every major medical cannabis study to find the actual points of scientific agreement", he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to analyse these studies, the team made use of an artificial intelligence natural language processing technique called "sentiment analysis". The technique allowed the researchers to verify how many studies had positive, negative and neutral views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The shocking results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

The study overwhelmingly supported the use of cannabis in treating cancer-related inflammation, appetite loss and nausea. Additionally, the surprising results also showcased that the drug could fight cancer cells themselves by killing them and stopping their spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a shocking degree of consensus in public health research, and certainly more than we were anticipating for a topic as controversial as medical cannabis,” said Castle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is cannabis used in medicine?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis is used in medicine in different forms.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Follicular fluid provides essential nutrients and biochemical signals for developing eggs. Contaminating that process with bits of plastic quite likely has implications for fertility, hormonal balance and overall reproductive health, the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings represent a major step toward figuring out how and why microplastics impact women’s reproductive health, but are also “very alarming”, Luigi Montano, a researcher at the University of Rome and study lead author, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1a79df02-31a9-47b0-aa8f-8d8b08e2cbe8" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘A scary time to be a scientist’: how medical research cuts will hurt the maternal mortality crisis","elementId":"1a79df02-31a9-47b0-aa8f-8d8b08e2cbe8","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/15/trump-medical-research-funding-maternal-mortality"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This discovery should serve as an important warning signal about the invasiveness of these emerging contaminants in the female reproductive system,” the study states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;From the top of Mt Everest to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, microplastics and smaller nanoplastics have been detected throughout the environment. Food is thought to be a main exposure route: recent studies found them in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123022352?via%3Dihub#sec3" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;all meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120305703#sec3" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;produce products&lt;/a&gt; tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Microplastics are particularly dangerous because they can contain any number of 16,000 plastic chemicals. That includes highly toxic compounds like &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/toxic-chemicals-substances/microplastics-phthalates-bpa-pfas-a1059022044/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Pfas, bisphenol and phthalates&lt;/a&gt;, which are linked to cancer, neurotoxicity, hormone disruption and developmental toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Microplastics have been found throughout the human body and can cross the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/21/microplastics-brain-pollution-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/27/microplastics-found-every-human-placenta-tested-study-health-impact#:~:text=The%20research%2C%20published%20in%20the,common%20plastics%20detected%2C%20after%20polyethylene." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;placental&lt;/a&gt; barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Montano’s latest paper is part of a &lt;a href="http://www.ecofoodfertility.it/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;larger project&lt;/a&gt; he’s leading for which he has also detected microplastics in human &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics11010040" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;urine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4457596" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;semen&lt;/a&gt;, and examines the impacts on fertility. He said he suspects microplastics are among chemicals driving plummeting sperm counts and a drop in overall sperm quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have proven this decline, especially in areas where pollution is bad,” Montano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Though men are more susceptible to the substance’s toxic effects, he added, women are also possibly impacted. Animal research has linked the presence of microplastics to ovarian dysfunction and health problems, like reduced oocyte maturation, and a lower capacity for fertilization. Another study on mice showed alterations to ovarian tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The paper notes a “possible presence of correlation between the concentration of microplastics” and reproductive health in the women who participated in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Montano added that the bisphenol, phthalates, Pfas and other highly toxic chemicals that use microplastics as a “Trojan horse” to get into the body, and into the ovaries, are “very dangerous”. The chemicals are already well-known for disrupting hormones and harming women’s reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The follicular fluid paper offers a “very important finding”, said Xiaozhong Yu, a University of New Mexico microplastics researcher, but he added that more work is needed to determine the dose and level of exposure at which adverse effects start to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is the work in the next phase – we need to quantify,” Yu said. His team is also attempting to answer some of those questions with broader epidemiological research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Montano’s team is doing similar work, and he’s spearheading research that is trying to determine how much reducing the use of plastic in the kitchen and eating an organic diet will reduce the level of microplastics in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The substances’ ubiquity makes it difficult to avoid, but reducing the amount of plastic used in the kitchen – from packaging to storage to utensils – can likely reduce exposures. Pesticides can contain microplastics, or in some cases are a form of microplastics, so eating organic may help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts also advise that people avoid heating plastic, or putting hot food and liquid in plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Single-use paper coffee cups, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/04/nist-study-shows-everyday-plastic-products-release-trillions-microscopic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can shed&lt;/a&gt; trillions of bits of plastic when hot liquid is added. Similarly, tea bags &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/microplastics-in-tea-bags-study-8770478" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can release&lt;/a&gt; billions of particles, and microwavable plastic is &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.3c01942" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;also a problem&lt;/a&gt;. Plastic utensils that briefly come into contact with hot pans can also leach chemicals; wood and stainless steel alternatives are less harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 23:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPOG55QUMtU0t3WDNtVU9DSUdjczlzUTlDV0RnclJBNjRqYUZ4bEJCNkZldEVwLVpITWhlODU1dmVLaFJfcVlHYjVDakxPbi1Za24xYmRZa0gxRGJ1ZjY3T0Z4d2tjYXZ1Vi1NRG0yMktYUzJjSkpXRktCanJEMU93TlpoSGxDVnJxbjJKRC0xQl9PS2NX</guid></item><item><title>另有3个州报告了2025年的首例麻疹病例- ABC新闻 | 3 more states report their first measles case of 2025 - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQc1pnUUFjdU5FeFV3bnhmeExFVndNM2psUTdZVEt1NFZzVEVOSHF3NW1KNGhySjRtc0pHcVhQbXM0SzdFcFRkYURhblhSUktuUENxbjlvQmtHRENKZW1qVVA2NWd6WWc0Vy1UZWJkQWdUN2V2MnZ2YS13ZkxMeFFaY19pOUJjM0lEVFHSAY8BQVVfeXFMTThBTDFLYVlIVnhGTW40UEhIeEFnWjc5N2pGSUZzLXFWSXFham9KLTBhTlVSNHBhVjZLMDBfNVBvUTMtR0Q3d205YUJlb3BfSUZrUERyMlV4c3RyZUZDTFlvVWlSeEVCY2NuS1dCTnh1bDUxTVJTUmRRUzlqRXVRNDY2b05SZUdYdWNZUFN2eEU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Louisiana, Virginia and Missouri all reported their first &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/Measles" target="_blank"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; cases of 2025 this weekend, with at least 27 states reporting at least one case.

A spokesperson for Kennedy said he is not anti-vaccine and that he is “committed to improving children’s health in America and has re-deployed resources to Texas to help with the current outbreak.” He did not answer why the health secretary chose to meet with and praise Edwards rather than any of the other doctors in West Texas who have been treating children in the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Edwards told The Associated Press in an email that he “interacted with zero patients that were not already infected with measles” during the time he was infectious. “Therefore, obviously, there were no patients that were put in danger of acquiring measles since they already had measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But Jessica Steier, a public health scientist, said the video shows Edwards in the room with people who do not appear sick, including parents of sick children and the people who visited the clinic from Children’s Health Defense.

            A Texas doctor who has been treating children in a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-day-care-lubbock-3d90c3ea9050c12dbc74a8f8142a6355" target="_blank"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; was shown on video with a measles rash on his face in a clinic a week before Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met him and praised him as an “extraordinary” healer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Dr. Ben Edwards appeared in the video posted March 31 by the anti-vaccine group Kennedy once led, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/how-rfk-jr-built-anti-vaccine-juggernaut-amid-covid-4997be1bcf591fe8b7f1f90d16c9321e" target="_blank"&gt;Children’s Health Defense&lt;/a&gt;. In it, Edwards appears wearing scrubs and talking with parents and children in a makeshift clinic he set up in Seminole, Texas, ground zero of the outbreak that has sickened hundreds of people and killed three, including two children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Edwards is asked whether he had measles, and he responded, “Yes,” then &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/nicole.zahra.5/videos/1196780422448813/" target="_blank"&gt;said his infection started the day before&lt;/a&gt; the video was recorded.

            “Yesterday was pretty achy. Little mild fever. Spots came in the afternoon. Today, I woke up feeling good,” Edwards said in the video.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Measles is most contagious for about four days before and four days after the rash appears and is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/" target="_blank"&gt;world’s most contagious diseases&lt;/a&gt;, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Doctors and public health experts said Edwards’ decision to go into the clinic put children, their parents and their community at risk because he could have spread it to others. They said there was no scenario in which Edwards’ conduct would be reasonable.

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has 800 cases of measles nationwide as of Friday, and two more states identified outbreaks this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/news/national-international/texas-has-majority-of-nations-700-measles-cases-heres-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Texas is driving the high numbers&lt;/a&gt;, with an outbreak centered in West Texas that started nearly three months ago and is up to 597 cases. Two unvaccinated elementary school-aged children died from measles-related illnesses near the epicenter in Texas, and an adult in New Mexico who was not vaccinated died of a measles-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Other states with active outbreaks — defined as three or more cases — include Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Mexico. The U.S. has &lt;a href="/news/business/money-report/people-should-be-worried-about-measles-expert-says-what-to-know-about-the-disease-vaccine-and-how-to-stay-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;more than double the number of measles cases&lt;/a&gt; it saw in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. &lt;a href="/news/national-international/measles-immune-system-brain-swelling-long-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;It is preventable through vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Health experts fear the virus will take hold in other U.S. communities with low vaccination rates and that the spread could stretch on for a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North America, an outbreak in Ontario, Canada has sickened 925 from mid-October through April 16. That's on top of cases in Mexico that the World Health Organization has said are linked to the Texas outbreak. A large outbreak in Chihuahua state has 433 cases as of April 18, according to data from the state health ministry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what else you need to know about measles in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How many measles cases are there in Texas and New Mexico?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas state health officials said Friday there were 36 new cases of measles since Tuesday, bringing the total to 597 across 25 counties — most of them in West Texas. Four more Texans were hospitalized, for a total of 62 throughout the outbreak, and Parmer and Potter counties logger their first cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State health officials estimated about 4% of cases — fewer than 30 — are actively infectious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixty-two percent of Texas' cases are in Gaines County, population 22,892, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has logged 371 cases since late January — just over 1% of the county's residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Health officials in Texas said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February — Kennedy said age 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Mexico announced five new cases this week, bringing the state’s total to 63. Three more people were in the hospital this week, for a total of six since the outbreak started. Most of the state's cases are in Lea County. Two are in Eddy County and Chaves and Doña Ana counties have one each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State health officials say the cases are linked to Texas’ outbreak based on genetic testing. New Mexico reported its first measles-related death in an adult on March 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kansas has 37 cases in eight counties in the southwest part of the state, health officials announced Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray and Morton counties have fewer than five cases each. Haskell County has the most with eight cases, Stevens County has seven, Kiowa County has six.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state's first reported case, identified in Stevens County on March 13, is linked to the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks based on genetic testing, a state health department spokesperson said. But health officials have not determined how the person was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How many cases are there in Oklahoma?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases in Oklahoma remained steady at 12 total cases Friday: nine confirmed and three probable. The first two probable cases were “associated” with the West Texas and New Mexico outbreaks, the state health department said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A state health department spokesperson said measles exposures were confirmed in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Rogers and Custer counties, but wouldn't say which counties had cases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How many cases are there in Ohio?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ohio Department of Health confirmed 30 measles cases in the state Thursday. The state county includes only Ohio residents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 14 cases in Ashtabula County near Cleveland, 14 in Knox County and one each in Allen and Holmes counties, the state said. The outbreak in Ashtabula County started with an unvaccinated adult who had interacted with someone who had traveled internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Knox County, in east-central Ohio, say there are a total of 20 people with measles, but seven of them do not live in Ohio. In 2022, a measles outbreak in central Ohio sickened 85.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How many cases are there in Indiana?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indiana has confirmed six connected cases of measles in Allen County in the northeast part of the state — four are unvaccinated minors and two are adults whose vaccination status is unknown. The cases have no known link to other outbreaks, the Allen County Department of Health said April 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How many cases are there in Pennsylvania?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In far northwest Pennsylvania, Erie County health officials declared a measles outbreak Monday after finding two new cases linked to a measles case confirmed March 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state has had nine cases overall this year, six of which are not linked to the outbreak, including international travel-related cases in Montgomery County and one in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How many cases are there in Michigan?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montcalm County, near Grand Rapids in western Michigan, has three linked measles cases. State health officials say the cases are tied to a large measles outbreak in Ontario, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state has seven confirmed measles cases as of Thursday, but the remaining four are not part of the Montcalm County outbreak. Michigan's last measles outbreak was in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been 800 cases in 2025 as of Friday, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 10 clusters — defined as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles cases have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What do you need to know about the MMR vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who have documentation that they had measles are immune and those born before 1957 generally don’t need the shots because most children back then had measles and now have “presumptive immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots. The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How can you treat measles?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

While doctors have repeatedly recommended factors like eating well and trying to do new activities to support brain health, research over the last few years has found two habits worth prioritizing in your daily life: &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63021061/how-many-miles-should-you-walk-a-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; and spending time with loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every walk you take is a step toward a sharper mind in more ways than one. A growing body of research shows that regular walking can boost memory, sharpen focus, and even slow cognitive decline—including reducing risk of developing dementia. Separate research has shown that walking can boost creativity, too. People who were physically active—including with walking—at some point within the last 3.5 hours showed processing speeds equivalent to someone four years younger while playing brain games, a recent &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62895429/walking-brain-health-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/abm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/abm/kaae059/7828202?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Annals of Behavioral Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Annals of Behavioral Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second game changer for your thinker: socialization. Your brain thrives on connection, and research backs this up. A separate body of research shows that regular social connection can shore up memory, problem-solving, and also reduce &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63902567/b12-dementia-risk-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dementia risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;. One study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(22)00199-4/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Lancet Healthy Longevity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Healthy Longevity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that people who interacted with family and friends on a weekly or monthly basis had a slower rate of memory decline than those who socialized less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/doctors/howard-jonathan-edward/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jonathan Howard, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jonathan Howard, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a neurologist at NYC Health and Hospitals/Bellevue. &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/geriatric-medicine/ca/santa-monica/scott-kaiser-1205042470" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scott Kaiser, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scott Kaiser, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is the director of geriatric cognitive health for the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center. &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev, MD,&lt;/a&gt; is medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, it's worth exploring whether doing both at once would be a double whammy for brain health. While this powerhouse combo hasn’t technically been studied formally just yet, doctors say there might be something to this health hack. Let's investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Walking With A Loved One Is A Smart Combo For Brain Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few mechanisms at play. One is the fact that walking is simply a great form of exercise. “Anything that improves overall cardiovascular health will help reduce dementia risk,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/doctors/howard-jonathan-edward/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jonathan Howard, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jonathan Howard, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at NYC Health and Hospitals/Bellevue. Your brain needs healthy blood vessels to function properly, get nutrients, and remove toxins, and there's an established &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-factors-heart-disease-linked-dementia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:link;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; between heart disease and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting your steps in can help support overall health—and that will do your brain a solid too, says &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev, MD,&lt;/a&gt; medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. “Overall health is important for brain health,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking directly boosts brain health, too. It &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.122.039919" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:triggers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;triggers&lt;/a&gt; the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that supports nerve cell growth and survival in the brain and spinal cord. BDNF is involved in crucial tasks like memory and learning, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/geriatric-medicine/ca/santa-monica/scott-kaiser-1205042470" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scott Kaiser, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scott Kaiser, MD&lt;/a&gt;, director of geriatric cognitive health for the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center. “That helps to create a well-functioning brain network,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking also can help reduce your overall stress levels. Stress can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763421000531" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:negatively impact;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;negatively impact&lt;/a&gt; your brain on a cellular level when it goes unchecked, and ramping up your step count can help counteract this, says Dr. Kaiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time with loved ones is an &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.19111158" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-stressor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-stressor&lt;/a&gt;, too, and can support &lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/102/13/1009" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:good heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;good heart health&lt;/a&gt; which, again, ultimately boosts brain health, Dr. Kaiser says. There may even be an indirect link here: “If you’re feeling well connected, you may be more likely to make better choices for your health—and brain health—around drinking, eating, and substance abuse,” Dr. Kaiser says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Women's Sneakers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether walking around the house or around the neighborhood, these “perfectly comfortable and lightweight shoes are a great value at an affordable price,” says Jacqueline Andriakos, &lt;em&gt;WH&lt;/em&gt; executive health and fitness director.

(However, a 28-week group-walking program helped people with dementia maintain a steady quality of life over the testing period, and the intervention was well-liked by both participants and their caregivers.) There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29084328/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; to support the benefits of group exercise, particularly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10464750/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:outdoor group exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;outdoor group exercise&lt;/a&gt;, especially when it comes to lowering stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that exercising is good and that socializing in groups is beneficial,” Dr. Kaiser says. “Theoretically, the benefits for brain health could be greater when you do them together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Often To Walk With Your Loved Ones For Optimal Brain Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to put a specific number on this, given that research hasn't extended into this territory just yet. If you want to set a lofty goal, Dr. Howard suggests trying to walk for 30 minutes at a time on most days of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it can be tricky to consistently block out that time with family and friends, Dr. Kaiser just recommends doing what you can. “Most evidence suggests that inactivity is bad and any amount of activity is a good amount,” he says. “But, in general, more is better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If going for longer walks with loved ones is hard to pull off, Dr. Kaiser recommends trying to squeeze in “&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64479203/can-walking-keep-you-in-shape/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:exercise snacks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;exercise snacks&lt;/a&gt;,” like walking out of the office at the end of the night with your work buddy or taking a lap around the neighborhood with your mom during a visit instead of catching up on the couch. You can also try taking up your own &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64516114/benefits-of-walking-for-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking habit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking habit&lt;/a&gt; and socializing by chatting on the phone with loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, you can take up this new habit any time. “I can’t think of any age group that won’t benefit from this,” Dr. Kaiser says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot that goes into &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62854242/how-to-improve-brain-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supporting good brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;supporting good brain health&lt;/a&gt;, but walking with a loved one checks off a lot of boxes and gets in some quality social time, too. “It makes sense to kill two birds with one stone,” Dr. Howard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 17:19:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1GWWFFSUNIcjg0Qk5aS3NFalN1Sl9WRi1BRlQyYk1sak5JOEJQU3praDl2M2dBWGVZLVBZTE9IWmlrdkVXamxiLVlXaGVKYzNSRVJTcVI0bWZuVlgtLWFUX0d2X3dybkg3Y1h4Q0hyNTUzeFVGeGd5RA</guid></item><item><title>我参观了被世界上最具传染性的疾病袭击的美国小镇……零地带的可怕现实--《每日邮报》 | I visited American town being hit by world's most infectious disease... the terrifying reality in ground zero - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPRVVqSGNRX0hfRy03ZzlvRDBkQTBlZS1MWDEzcDlybHBTQlJiQmhrdVFORElsc0pGN1JJRXIzU0JTZWU0Q0JTQWNORXE3dWo2YUptRzNhVUJfQWdPRklMWGxZcHRuUmRwTG5nOVJTeC1wckt1Q3l2V3pvWTlEXzNadEJZeU5IU3BGX0didWVCc2pDQWNmX3dQdUg3Rnhad1ZCX2ZhONIBqgFBVV95cUxPRmZWS0ZZNVYzcTItODVwc05DMEw5MUtMTFFHTGtIc0lWNWt1bVdGM0tmd1hTNDl1TXRhempYYno3MlpmcjZoZHBuQmRxWXRKXzVkZ1NmRk5JX1JyVzE4T25EM1QtSGZnNEV2R0VEZ01TaGJFd3YwbWhBdDNzM0ZYR2Q4LS02M1A5aldJNjhCenpNaElyQ29fcHVpTDZ4blJuMlMtM2FqWThHZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I'm in a busy supplements store in West &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-46506d40-1c76-11f0-805a-97be76b02f96"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; when a woman walks in coughing as she weaves through the shelves of vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A store clerk approached, and the two spoke in hushed, urgent tones about a 'very sick' child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was then quietly directed to a display of cod liver oil bottles labeled 'for kids' at the front of the store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her cough — &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14618263/Michigan-state-measles-Ingham-County-baby-girl.html"&gt;a potential telltale sign of measles&lt;/a&gt; — no one batted an eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Customers kept browsing, seemingly unaware they may have just been exposed to the most infectious disease on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I'm in the rural town of Seminole — the epicenter of America's deadliest measles outbreak in a decade, one that has already claimed the lives of two young girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This town of 7,000 people, located in Gaines County near the New Mexico border, is a breeding ground for anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, reflected in the fact it has one of the lowest measles vaccination rates in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only around 82 percent of residents are immunized, well below the 95 percent needed to stop measles from spreading. Many here choose to rely instead on 'natural remedies' like those sold in this busy store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cod liver oil contains vitamin A, which some evidence suggests may help support the immune system as it fights a measles infection. The &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14559743/children-texas-poisoned-rfk-jr-measles-cases.html"&gt;supplements have been promoted&lt;/a&gt; by vaccine skeptic and HHS Secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;EPICENTER: A sign at the measles testing center in Seminole. The center is quietly getting busier as the reality of the outbreak sets in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;BEHIND THE HEADLINES: I'm in the epicenter of America's deadliest measles outbreak in a decade, one that has already claimed the lives of two young girls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Official figures suggest 62 patients have been hospitalized with measles in West Texas and nearly 600 people have been sickened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But having been here, on the ground, that number feels like a massive understatement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's nearly impossible to go anywhere in Seminole without meeting someone who personally knows someone affected by measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over coffee in a local cafe, I met a woman who described how her neighbors — an entire family — had all come down with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Later, in a nearby parking lot, another woman told me how three different families she knew had all been sickened.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials continue to stress that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles, but the message appears to be falling on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seminole is home to a tight-knit community of Mennonites — a reserved and generally well-off Christian sect that often favors natural remedies over modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is nothing in Mennonite scripture that explicitly forbids vaccines, many in the community choose to avoid them, swayed by local rumors of dangerous side effects and the belief that vaccines simply don't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, public health officials have urged those who are unvaccinated and exposed — or showing symptoms — to isolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in practice, there's little evidence that this guidance is being widely followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;ANTIVAX LOCALS: Judy (left) said her family hasn't got the MMR vaccine because they don't like the things in it. Joselyn doesn't want to get her children vaccinated despite the outbreak because she claims to know people who've had adverse reactions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One Mennonite woman in a blue-and-white dress, holding a bag of groceries, told me she believed measles was actually 'good for the immune system,' and that children could benefit from catching it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Outside a gym, another woman said she preferred not to vaccinate her children because of 'all the potential side effects.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her fears about side effects are, of course, overblown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93 percent effective against measles; two doses offer 97 percent protection — and drastically reduce the risk of serious complications or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yes, there are side effects from the MMR vaccine — the most common being a sore arm, mild fever, or a light rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, more serious reactions have been reported, including seizures in children under 23 months. But these occur in fewer than one in 10,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles itself is far more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to CDC data, about one in five unvaccinated children infected with measles requires hospitalization. One in 20 develops pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around one in 1,000 suffers encephalitis — swelling of the brain that can lead to permanent damage and, sadly, often death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Seminole, that grim statistic has become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;TRAGIC: Eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand is the second child to die in the escalating measles outbreak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14597353/measles-outbreak-west-texas-daisy-hildebrand-pictured.html"&gt;Eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand &lt;/a&gt;and six-year-old Kayley Fehr both lost their lives to measles complications &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They mark not only a local tragedy, but also the first confirmed measles-related deaths in the US since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I met with Daisy's father outside a gas station, his eyes rimmed red and voice cracking with grief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was adamant she wasn't killed by measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She did not die of the measles,' he said.

'The [MMR] vaccine ain't worth a damn,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My brother's family got it and they all still got sick — worse than my unvaccinated kids. This isn't about the vaccine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daisy and Kayley are buried both buried the Reinlander cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their graves are modest, marked only with simple plaques — quiet reminders of the tragedy that has rocked this small town. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But even in mourning, misinformation is taking root. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Religion clearly plays a role in the opposition to vaccination in Seminole, but something dangerous is also happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group co-founded by RFK Jr, has been in contact with the families of the deceased and is now actively pushing the narrative that measles wasn't to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That message is reverberating through the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local rumor mills are spinning a different story — one where measles isn't nearly as dangerous as health officials claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I got measles when I was young,' said Jake, a farmhand standing outside the Southern Rose cafe in the town's center, chewing on a toothpick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Business as usual: Guests in Perikas, the main restaurant in Seminole. It was packed when I visited, and there wasn't a single sign warning about measles in sight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It wasn't that bad, I remember I had to be at home for a bit, but I got lots of ice cream'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To combat the outbreak, local health officials have opened a measles testing and vaccination center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What began as a small operation in a parking lot has since expanded into a large, drive-thru facility — a sign perhaps that people are beginning to take the crisis seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Workers at the drive-thru clinic told me that, in the early days of the outbreak, Seminole felt like a ghost town. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People were afraid — not of the virus, but of being seen at the testing site and judged by neighbors for engaging with public health services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like a lot of towns across the US, there has been an erosion of trust in public institutions which stem from lockdowns and vaccine mandates during Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now that the clinic has been moved to a shed, attendance has crept up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;STATE VISIT: Peter Hildebrand with his wife Eva and two of his children. They met with anti-vaccine crusader RFK Jr, health secretary, after the death of their daughter Daisy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite cooperation from the public slowly starting to creep up, not everyone is on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Those two deaths, now they were tragic,' a farmer told me, before adding, 'but most of the time, measles really is a mild illness'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only about 82 percent of children entering kindergarten in Gaines County, where Seminole is located, are vaccinated against measles — well below the 95 percent threshold experts say is needed for herd immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also below the national average of 91.6 percent coverage by 24 months of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local officials have attempted to stem the spread by putting up posters warning of the outbreak and directing people to the testing center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the flyers are mostly confined to government buildings like the courthouse and county office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I didn't see them in places that actually draw people in: restaurants, local stores, or even Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;GROUND ZERO: The above map shows Gaines County (in dark orange) and the surrounding counties where measles cases have been diagnosed. It appears that this outbreak is very much just at the beginning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the supplement store — a known hotspot for anti-vaccine sentiment and where symptomatic people continue to gather — staff told me they've had no visit from any public health department representatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While anti-vaccine rhetoric echoes loudly across Seminole, it's not the only voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Outside the Walmart, I met a Mennonite woman who told me she'd chosen to vaccinate all of her children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's the right thing to do,' she said. 'To protect their health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, the mesles crisis is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of mid-April, there have been almost 800 confirmed measles cases across 24 states — the highest number since 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if the current pace continues, 2025 could surpass that year’s total of 1,274 cases — making it the worst outbreak in the US since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two deaths in Seminole are the only confirmed measles fatalities so far this year, but many fear there could be more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Widespread federal health cuts — including about $12 billion slashed from health services under the Trump administration — have local health officials in Texas concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the vaccination site here remains open, for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 16:32:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPRVVqSGNRX0hfRy03ZzlvRDBkQTBlZS1MWDEzcDlybHBTQlJiQmhrdVFORElsc0pGN1JJRXIzU0JTZWU0Q0JTQWNORXE3dWo2YUptRzNhVUJfQWdPRklMWGxZcHRuUmRwTG5nOVJTeC1wckt1Q3l2V3pvWTlEXzNadEJZeU5IU3BGX0didWVCc2pDQWNmX3dQdUg3Rnhad1ZCX2ZhONIBqgFBVV95cUxPRmZWS0ZZNVYzcTItODVwc05DMEw5MUtMTFFHTGtIc0lWNWt1bVdGM0tmd1hTNDl1TXRhempYYno3MlpmcjZoZHBuQmRxWXRKXzVkZ1NmRk5JX1JyVzE4T25EM1QtSGZnNEV2R0VEZ01TaGJFd3YwbWhBdDNzM0ZYR2Q4LS02M1A5aldJNjhCenpNaElyQ29fcHVpTDZ4blJuMlMtM2FqWThHZw</guid></item><item><title>新研究发现，夜间锻炼可能会扰乱您的睡眠-解密 | Evening Workouts Could Be Disrupting Your Sleep, New Study Finds - Decrypt</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE5nY1AtUmlpeGt0MnVBVG9wUFBjekFOM2F2RDQ3MzQtS0dPcXAzdXl5MGZxN05oUkp0TVJaY3FCRy1JWjcyVWpNV1U0ZHd2akVfTG15WmoyWmNrSjZSci1Uc2d5WEJHbU42YkRr0gFzQVVfeXFMTUwxQThHMzQ3VTFWNzRldGdmcWV5Q0hfQm1ZTWFEaW52WFBPaVdzc1d6SEV4MFpTd3VzQnhNNnhTMlpfd29KcVptdGNiMU9DSmNZLXhpVWFaWUI1ZlZCRUpTbUJ1c0p0T1lKaGdGYkt6NXdQRQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-8 unreset post-content md:pb-20"&gt;&lt;p id="myriad-pm-widget-content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pt-8 pb-10 border-t border-b border-decryptGridline "&gt;&lt;h4 class="sc-b2a202e4-4 bNRGqr gg-dark:text-white"&gt;In brief&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class="font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;According to a new study, high-intensity exercise performed close to bedtime can significantly disrupt sleep quality and slow overnight recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;The study analyzed data from nearly 15,000 physically active adults over a year and measured the impact of various levels of workouts close to bedtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Researchers recommend completing high-intensity exercise at least four hours before sleep onset to optimize sleep quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Night owls who hit the gym hard might be losing more than just sweat—your sleep could be taking a hit, too, according to a new international &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58271-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="sc-adb616fe-0 bJsyml"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Researchers from the United States, Australia, and Switzerland found that high-intensity exercise performed close to bedtime can significantly disrupt sleep quality, and slow overnight recovery. The findings, published Tuesday in &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that people seeking better sleep health should avoid strenuous workouts within four hours of going to bed, or opt for lighter exercise during that window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Scientists and health advocates have long emphasized that &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/214485/power-naps-can-keep-your-brain-from-shrinking-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="sc-adb616fe-0 bJsyml"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; is essential for cognitive function, immune system health, emotional well-being, and physical recovery, making it a vital component of overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“Nothing is more important to me than sleep,” biohacker &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/205729/bryan-johnson-longevity-blueprint-sleep-gene-therapy-kate-tolo" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="sc-adb616fe-0 bJsyml"&gt;Bryan Johnson&lt;/a&gt; previously told &lt;i&gt;Decrypt&lt;/i&gt;. “I plan when I eat, my social events, my work schedule, everything around sleep, which is exactly the exact opposite of what society does right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;To explore the effects of exercise timing and intensity, researchers analyzed sleep and exercise data from 14,689 physically active adults over the course of a year, using wearable biometric devices developed by the performance tracking company Whoop. The study focused on how the timing and intensity, referred to in the study as "exercise strain"—a measure of total physical exertion during a workout—affected the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“Public health guidelines recommend exercise as a key lifestyle intervention for promoting and maintaining healthy sleep function and reducing disease risk,” the study said. “However, strenuous evening exercise may disrupt sleep due to heightened sympathetic arousal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Sympathetic arousal is the state in which the body remains alert and physiologically activated, making it harder to wind down for rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“To optimize sleep, individuals should aim to complete bouts of exercise four or more hours before their sleep onset to minimize potential adverse consequences to their sleep,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Will Ahmed, the CEO of Whoop, emphasized the importance of timing in training on X (formerly Twitter). “If you're training hard but not sleeping well, when you work out may matter just as much as how you work out,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="relative w-full"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;When exercise ended two hours before habitual sleep time, participants who engaged in maximal strain workouts fell asleep an average of 36 minutes later, and slept 22 minutes less than those who performed light exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;According to the study, the disruptions were even more pronounced when exercise extended past a person’s usual bedtime, with sleep duration cut by up to 43 minutes​. The study also challenged traditional sleep health guidelines, which have typically discouraged exercising in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“Contrary to previous sleep health guidelines that discourage exercise at night, recent guidelines are less conservative, suggesting, for example, that moderate-intensity exercise ending at least 90 minutes before bedtime will not delay or disrupt sleep,” the researchers wrote. “However, these guidelines do not mention the duration of permissible moderate-intensity evening exercise; a critical consideration when quantifying exercise strain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="my-4 border-b border-decryptGridline"&gt;&lt;div class="text-start p-8 md:py-12 md:px-12 max-w-prose relative"&gt;&lt;span class="border-t-4 border-l-4 w-4 h-4 md:border-t-[6px] md:border-l-[6px] md:w-6 md:h-6 border-decryptPurple dark:border-decryptNeon gg-dark:border-cc-pink-2 absolute top-4 left-4 md:top-6 md:left-6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="border-t-4 border-l-4 w-4 h-4 md:border-t-[6px] md:border-l-[6px] md:w-6 md:h-6 border-decryptPurple dark:border-decryptNeon gg-dark:border-cc-pink-2 absolute rotate-180 bottom-4 right-4 md:bottom-6 md:right-6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="font-akzidenz-grotesk font-bold text-xl md:text-3xl md:text-center gg-dark:text-white"&gt;Generally Intelligent Newsletter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="font-akzidenz-grotesk text-base md:text-xl mt-2 mb-6 md:text-center gg-dark:text-white"&gt;A weekly AI journey narrated by Gen, a generative AI model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mb-8 mt-6 flex items-center gap-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="money-made-embed" data-embed-widget="horizontalOffers" data-params="profile=decryptco1" data-utm-medium="https://decrypt.co/315506/evening-workouts-disrupting-sleep" data-utm-source="decryptco" data-utm-campaign="horizontalOffers" data-url="https://decrypt.co/315506/evening-workouts-disrupting-sleep"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Decrypt</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 16:00:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE5nY1AtUmlpeGt0MnVBVG9wUFBjekFOM2F2RDQ3MzQtS0dPcXAzdXl5MGZxN05oUkp0TVJaY3FCRy1JWjcyVWpNV1U0ZHd2akVfTG15WmoyWmNrSjZSci1Uc2d5WEJHbU42YkRr0gFzQVVfeXFMTUwxQThHMzQ3VTFWNzRldGdmcWV5Q0hfQm1ZTWFEaW52WFBPaVdzc1d6SEV4MFpTd3VzQnhNNnhTMlpfd29KcVptdGNiMU9DSmNZLXhpVWFaWUI1ZlZCRUpTbUJ1c0p0T1lKaGdGYkt6NXdQRQ</guid></item><item><title>VDH确认该州2025年首例麻疹病例- WWBT | VDH confirms state’s first measles case of 2025 - WWBT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxOcTBMd2VVVTZaRk44MHFKRDltSnM0N0drRTIzbUR0YTFRX3lZZl8xUnltVkgtUHFwN2ZpVlNUVnJFRWpIRkYta056bzNsaVhlYm5QM3BKZFN4Y09lOFpZQnR0SFpjbndCa3hWWnpmWTM4QzFtZlpLdXlncmc2UFpsZnVkb1hZZmhfOU1iMdIBoAFBVV95cUxNQUJ1Q1hYV1BwVktDSUkwdHQyejVvRDlSTm9aeUdvY2ZSZjBURFM0QnFWelN6NTBnOXhBVUxQZTRJdTV2M0FJWXlxZV9BRGhKck1zMkhBTnpRbGx6TjViQVNsS3VZYWFBMFNTNk5uMHUzTi1lMHF6dHhtbHBvZTFsVEozNC1mWnQ5QUlqNWpIcHEtdDdnM3N6T1RRamtQdTlw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;RICHMOND, Va.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virginia Health Officials Confirm First 2025 Measles Case in the State&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Virginia Department of Health is Working to Identify People Who Are at Risk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RICHMOND, Va. – The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) is reporting the state’s first measles case of the year. The patient is a child (0-4 years) in the Northwest Region who recently traveled internationally. To protect the family’s privacy, VDH will not provide any additional information about the patient. Health officials are coordinating efforts to identify anyone who might have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This first case of measles in Virginia this year is a reminder of how easily this highly contagious disease can spread, particularly with international travel,” said &lt;strong&gt;VDH State Epidemiologist Laurie Forlano, D.O., M.P.H.&lt;/strong&gt; “Vaccination remains our best defense against measles and is safe and highly effective at protecting people and preventing outbreaks. We urge Virginians, especially those planning to travel, to check their vaccination status, talk to their health care provider, and get the MMR vaccine if needed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listed below are the dates, times, and locations of potential exposure sites in Virginia:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiser Permanente Caton Hill Medical Center, Advanced Urgent Care, located at 13285 Minnieville Road in Woodbridge on Tuesday, April 15 from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaiser Permanente Fredericksburg Medical Center, Pediatrics Department, located at 1201 Hospital Drive in Fredericksburg on Wednesday, April 16 from noon to 5 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you do if you were at the above locations on the day and time specified?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have never received a measles containing vaccine (either the measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine or a measles-only vaccine which is available in other countries), you may be at risk of developing measles.&lt;strong&gt; Anyone who might have been exposed and is considered to be at risk of developing measles should contact their healthcare provider immediately. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch for symptoms for 21 days after the date of your potential exposure.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you notice symptoms of measles, immediately isolate yourself by staying home.&lt;/strong&gt; Contact your healthcare provider right away.&lt;strong&gt; If you need to seek healthcare, call ahead before going to your healthcare provider’s office or the emergency room &lt;/strong&gt;to notify them that you may have been exposed to measles and ask them to call the local health department. This call will help protect other patients and staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone with an immunocompromising condition should consult with their healthcare provider if they have questions or develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have received two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have received only one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, you are very likely to be protected and your risk of being infected with measles from any of these exposures is very low. However, to achieve the highest level of protection, contact your healthcare provider about getting a second vaccine dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/"&gt;Measles&lt;/a&gt; is a highly contagious illness that can spread easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Measles symptoms usually appear in two stages. In the first stage, most people have a fever of greater than 101 degrees, runny nose, watery red eyes, and a cough. These symptoms usually start seven to fourteen days after being exposed. The second stage starts three to five days after symptoms start, when a rash begins to appear on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. People with measles are contagious from four days before the rash appears through four days after the rash appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is preventable through a safe and effective MMR vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are given to provide lifetime protection. Virginia has high measles vaccination rates, with approximately 95% of kindergarteners fully vaccinated against measles. However, infants who are too young to be vaccinated, and others who are not vaccinated, are very susceptible to infection if they are exposed to measles. Infants six months through 11 months of age who will be traveling internationally, or to an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/"&gt;outbreak setting&lt;/a&gt;, should receive one dose of MMR vaccine prior to travel. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions about the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check your immunization status, call your healthcare provider or request your vaccination records using the &lt;a href="https://redcap.vdh.virginia.gov/redcap/surveys/?s=NCMHWL3HK8"&gt;VDH Immunization Record Request Form&lt;/a&gt;. Virginia residents with additional questions about their potential exposure can email &lt;a href="mailto:epi_response@vdh.virginia.gov"&gt;epi_response@vdh.virginia.gov&lt;/a&gt; or contact your &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/local-health-districts/"&gt;local health department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There's now lots of evidence which &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-a-daily-glass-of-milk-really-could-reduce-bowel-cancer-risk-an-oncologist-explains-247301"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942"&gt;our&lt;/a&gt; own &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;diets&lt;/a&gt; and the foods we eat can influence the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/king-charles-is-changing-his-diet-to-keep-his-cancer-at-bay-heres-what-the-evidence-says-245582"&gt;outcome&lt;/a&gt; if we are unlucky enough to suffer from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="158410" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are especially interested in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24861-8"&gt;how this happens&lt;/a&gt;, in particular the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind these associations. This would better inform &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24861-8"&gt;nutritional recommendations&lt;/a&gt; and help us understand how cancer forms so we can prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm9805"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; has identified a molecular link between linoleic acid, a common fat contained in cooking oils, and aggressive breast cancer, renewing the discussion about dietary choices and cancer risk. The findings, while significant, require careful interpretation to avoid unnecessary alarm and give useful guidance to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Common fatty acid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleic_acid"&gt;Linoleic acid&lt;/a&gt; is an omega-6 fatty acid which is found in abundant quantities in soybean, sunflower and corn oils. Researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York showed it can directly activate a growth pathway in triple-negative breast cancer cells – a type of breast cancer especially known for its &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32125284/"&gt;aggressiveness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31927455/"&gt;limited treatment options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triple negative breast cancer makes up about 15% of all breast cancer cases, but because breast cancer is so common, this affects a lot of people. The researchers found that linoleic acid binds to a protein called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FABP5"&gt;FABP5&lt;/a&gt; (fatty acid-binding protein 5), which is at high levels in these cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This binding triggers the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-019-0199-y"&gt;mTORC1 pathway&lt;/a&gt; – a critical regulator of cell growth and metabolism – fuelling tumour progression in preclinical research, including animal studies. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37596643/"&gt;My current research&lt;/a&gt; focuses on this pathway in a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.1387/v2"&gt;normal and cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm9805"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, mice fed a high linoleic-acid diet developed larger tumours, suggesting dietary intake may exacerbate this cancer's growth. There was a link to people too: elevated FABP5 and linoleic acid levels were detected in blood samples from triple-negative breast cancer patients, strengthening the biological plausibility of this link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr John Blenis, the senior author of the paper, said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery helps clarify the relationship between dietary fats and cancer, and sheds light on how to define which patients might benefit the most from specific nutritional recommendations in a personalised manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also possible that the implications extend beyond triple negative breast cancer to other tumours such as prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linoleic acid is an &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37513547/"&gt;essential fatty acid&lt;/a&gt; so it must be obtained from food. It plays a role in skin health, cell membrane structure and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31785494/"&gt;inflammation regulation&lt;/a&gt;. However, modern diets, which are rich in processed foods, ultraprocessed foods and seed oils, often provide excessive omega-6 fats, including linoleic acid, while lacking omega-3s, which are found in fish, flaxseeds and walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wIhbYA5QLEw?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This imbalance could promote &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00658-5"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which is a well known &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6831096/"&gt;contributor to cancer&lt;/a&gt; and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study therefore suggests that linoleic acid may directly drive cancer growth in specific contexts. This challenges earlier observational studies that found no clear association between dietary linoleic acid and overall breast cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a 2023  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="158410" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 14 studies in over 350,000 women concluded that linoleic acid intake had &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10271020/"&gt;no significant effect&lt;/a&gt; on breast cancer risk in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discrepancy highlights the importance of researchers looking specifically at cancer subtypes and also individual factors, such as FABP5 levels in cancers themselves. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10558966/"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; showed that linoleic acid was protective against breast cancer, which demonstrates why it's important to consider everything in context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't panic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media headlines can often oversimplify complex research. While this new study highlights a plausible mechanism linking linoleic acid to cancer growth, it does not prove that cooking oils cause breast cancer – far from it. Other factors, such as genetics, overall diet and environmental exposures, play significant roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings do not warrant blanket avoidance of seed oils but suggest moderation and selectivity, especially for high-risk individuals. Many oils such as olive oil contain less linoleic acid and higher monounsaturated or saturated fats, which are more stable at high heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do also consider &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00879-6"&gt;eating more fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; as part of a healthy, balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GMZ1NVSPh6I?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03570-5"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; that comprehensively analysed eating habits over 30 years showed that diets that are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and low-fat dairy products were linked to healthy ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that study, the Harvard team followed more than 100,000 people between 1986 and 2016. Fewer than 10% of respondents achieved healthy ageing, defined by a lack of 11 major chronic diseases and no impairment in cognitive, physical or mental function by the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisations like the World Cancer Research Fund emphasise that moderate use of vegetable oils is safe and that &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/action-on-obesity"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, not specific fats, is the primary dietary driver of cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study, then, underscores the importance of contextualising dietary fats in cancer research. While linoleic acid's role in triple-negative breast cancer is a critical discovery, it's one piece of a vast puzzle. A balanced, wholefood diet remains an important cornerstone of cancer prevention, and a strategy everyone can adopt.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254255/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;F. A. Hayek, 1974 Nobel Prize lecture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forgive me for how precious-sounding this is, but: If you really want to understand COVID politics in the United States, you have to unwind American political history all the way back to 1776—and a bit before, getting to know that character who shouldn’t exist but somehow does: the conservative revolutionary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID unleashed a lot of different kinds of crazy in the United States, and, on the right, it broke the dam for a special kind of crazy, the kind that leads to the embrace of crackpots such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Of course, the political group that we now call, broadly speaking, the American right has always been convulsed by irreconcilable contradictions because the American project itself is founded in a paradox: There is, strictly speaking, no such thing as a conservative revolution, but that is approximately what the Founding Fathers carried out. And from the New Deal through to the present, the right has been torn between its conservative tendencies and its revolutionary tendencies. Dwight Eisenhower called himself a “progressive conservative”; William F. Buckley Jr. called himself a ”radical conservative” and insisted that whatever it was his new movement was going to stand for, it was against Eisenhower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the founders, there were plenty of wild-eyed utopians and radicals, but the revolution ended up being led by relatively conservative figures such as George Washington and John Adams (who had originally opposed separating from England) and others of similar temperament, who made the case that they were not so much overturning a legitimate political order as restoring and securing their ancient rights as Englishmen. The American project is a marriage between the forces of conservatism (property and religion) and the forces of radicalism (majoritarianism, disestablishmentarianism, etc.), and, to the extent that the American right acts as a conservator of the American tradition, it feels those contradictions deeply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few decades, we have seen a collection of episodes—9/11 and its global aftermath, the 2008 financial crisis and the Tea Party movement that grew out of it, the COVID controversies, January 6—that could be understood either as a series of progressively radicalizing events for the Right or, conversely, as an endless and repetitious acting out of that great American contradiction, politically of a piece with everything from the Jacksonian opposition to the central bank to southern secession to George Wallace and enraged populist opposition to the Civil Rights Movement (the right should not in this sense be thought of as synonymous with the Republican Party) to the Ross Perot phenomenon in the 1990s to the rise of Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an identifiable and discrete political phenomenon, the American conservative movement might locate its beginning to the publication of Buckley’s &lt;em&gt;God and Man at Yale&lt;/em&gt;, a populist attack on the Ivy League written by a moneyed aristocrat from Connecticut, young and Yale-educated and not at all uninterested in making a name for himself. Buckley in the volume heaped scorn on elite institutions, argued that those at the top of such institutions were abusing their positions for self-interested reasons, rejected “the superstitions of ‘academic freedom’” as his subtitle had it, and was deeply skeptical of claims of expertise when those claims came from quarters unaligned with his values and interests: From the beginning, the right was ready for COVID. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so was the left, in its way, and the journalist David Zweig documents that in his new book, &lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262549158/an-abundance-of-caution/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Abundance of Caution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While the right descended from the realms of propriety—mainline Protestantism, the Chamber of Commerce, the country clubs—into 1968-style paranoia and nihilism, progressives passed them on the opposite side of the road, having completed that “long march through the institutions” and installed progressive allies at the commanding heights of culture, media, business, education—&lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;. The left’s irreconcilable contradiction, which you can see personified in the vicious young Hamas champions at Columbia University, comes from the marriage of adversarial protest culture to the facts of life at the top of the org chart: When Ivy League students denounce Ivy League administrators, that is a left-on-left struggle session, with conservatives on the sidelines. But the Trump administration’s bungled response to COVID gave progressives a way to keep all of those feet, in Birkenstocks and in sensible managers’ brogues, marching in the same direction: The hysterical progressive overreaction to COVID served the left’s vestigial need to denounce and to protest, while also serving the progressive desire to submit themselves to the management of empowered experts and to require the submission of others to that expert management. “Liberals, who had long been disgusted by the president, now found their disgust metastasized into fear- and indignation-driven rage,” Zweig writes. “A new, contagious virus was circulating in the country and the guy in charge, a paragon of wishful thinking and unseriousness, was going to cause unnecessary mayhem and harm and deaths. As in any classic story, an antipode to the villain was needed.” He identifies that heroic as being filled initially by former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, “projecting a paternalistic, calming authority,” but the hero ended up being a collective one: paternalistic, calming authority itself, along with all of its most telegenic vessels and sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zweig intelligently catalogues a number of underlying factors that positioned the American expert class to make all the wrong decisions while trying to make the most of the crisis, putting it to the service of their political and social agendas and, not incidentally, their careers. Those problems include: overreliance on mathematical models that can be tweaked for ideological ends where empirical observation and measurement provide insufficient support for the preferred policy—or would militate against it if taken into account; the fetishization of technology in education, very nicely illustrated by Bill Clinton, ensorcelled by the apparent early promise of the classroom internet, repeating almost verbatim identical claims that had been made about radio in its infancy—and that were made about film and television as well; the moronizing effects of reflexive political tribalism—there was a time when the Trump campaign could complain, with some reason, that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were working to “undermine the public’s confidence in the coming coronavirus vaccine,” ironic as that complaint is to read today with Marjorie Taylor Greene in the House and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Cabinet; the related self-censorship of the media in the service of narrow partisan interests and dogmatic progressivism; and misalignment of incentives, with policymakers (disproportionately progressive-leaning) captured by special interests (notably Randi Weingarten and the teachers’ unions) and thence producing policy agendas that did not serve the public interest, a situation that would be familiar enough to anybody who had ever read a few pages of F. A. Hayek or James Buchanan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt; (I mean the &lt;a href="https://www.mercatus.org/people/james-m-buchanan-jr"&gt;public-choice economist&lt;/a&gt;, not the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; president.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About that final point: Reading &lt;em&gt;An Abundance of Caution&lt;/em&gt; is a little bit like reading Ezra Klein in the past few years, as ladies and gentlemen of the sort who write for the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;seem to discover phenomena that have been at the center of the liberal-libertarian critique of progressivism for a century or so. When it comes to housing supply, for example, Klein and Matt Yglesias have even discovered that &lt;em&gt;regulation has unintended consequences!&lt;/em&gt; You won’t find Hayek’s essays or &lt;em&gt;The Calculus of Consent&lt;/em&gt; in Zweig’s index, and, what’s worse, you won’t find very much evidence that the author has read such works—which he should have, given the light a century’s accumulation of economic and political literature might have shed on his subject. (Also: He’s very soft on progressive education reformer John Dewey, so he’s lucky I’m reviewing the book and not Jonah Goldberg, who &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gSsrwZDA3Q"&gt;reacts strongly&lt;/a&gt; to the name.) The 2020s have been, for libertarians, a time of watching the unseemly spectacle of our friends on the left learning the most elementary things in public and the somewhat sorrier spectacle of our friends on the right forgetting what little they had learned, or had pretended to learn, about the epistemic problems of central planning and—most directly relevant to Zweig’s work—“the pretense of knowledge,” as Hayek famously put it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it is, of course, the pretense of knowledge that Zweig really is writing about, particularly when it comes to such considerations as mathematical modeling. As Hayek remarked in his Nobel Prize lecture, economists and other social scientists suffer from envy of the physical sciences. They attempt to imitate the methods of the physical sciences, but there is a problem with their doing so: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the position that exists in the physical sciences, in economics and other disciplines that deal with essentially complex phenomena, the aspects of the events to be accounted for about which we can get quantitative data are necessarily limited and may not include the important ones. While in the physical sciences it is generally assumed, probably with good reason, that any important factor which determines the observed events will itself be directly observable and measurable, in the study of such complex phenomena as the market, which depend on the actions of many individuals, all the circumstances which will determine the outcome of a process, for reasons which I shall explain later, will hardly ever be fully known or measurable. And while in the physical sciences the investigator will be able to measure what, on the basis of a prima facie theory, he thinks important, in the social sciences often that is treated as important which happens to be accessible to measurement. This is sometimes carried to the point where it is demanded that our theories must be formulated in such terms that they refer only to measurable magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can hardly be denied that such a demand quite arbitrarily limits the facts which are to be admitted as possible causes of the events which occur in the real world. This view, which is often quite naively accepted as required by scientific procedure, has some rather paradoxical consequences. We know: of course, with regard to the market and similar social structures, a great many facts which we cannot measure and on which indeed we have only some very imprecise and general information. And because the effects of these facts in any particular instance cannot be confirmed by quantitative evidence, they are simply disregarded by those sworn to admit only what they regard as scientific evidence: they thereupon happily proceed on the fiction that the factors which they can measure are the only ones that are relevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, of course, the ladies and gentlemen managing the COVID response would have done well to consider Hayek’s great maxim: “The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which might help the author understand how, for example, Imperial College London’s influential epidemic model, produced by Prof. Neil Ferguson, loomed so large while being so thin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferguson’s model assumed that 37 percent of transmission occurs in schools and workplaces, with schools having twice the transmission rate as workplaces. These figures are very important—they are the basis of the model, and the foundation of its projections about the effect of school closures. So, where did Ferguson get these figures? The answer is not in the main paper. To find the source of the figure one has to spelunk deep into the paper’s supplement, where you would discover the following text: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is necessary to make assumptions about the proportion of transmission which occurs in schools and workplaces, as data do not exist. … Our assumption is that 37% of transmission occurs in these contexts, with the within-school transmission coefficient being twice that of the within-workplace coefficient. However, this choice is arbitrary.” If you need to take a moment to let the previous sentences sink in, I understand. When I first found this passage I felt like a cartoon character rubbing his eyes at seeing a mirage. I had to read it three times before I believed it was real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of our progressive friends have figured out that the “expertise” put into force during the pandemic was in fact fallible. But when it comes to federally directed green-energy boondoggles or Washington-based management of the housing market—or similar intrusions in education, or health care, or much else—they do not seem quite prepared to apply the lessons they have learned more generally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathematical modeling led the public health authorities and self-interested politicians to support suboptimal and, at times, even idiotic COVID mitigation policies. But that is hardly the end of the story. Consider the prominence of mathematical modeling in the climate debate. There are real questions (far beyond my competence to work through) about climate models themselves, but climate policy involves modeling more than the climate itself. For example, many claims about reduced energy use in supposedly “green” buildings are based on mathematical models that have &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-05/reconsidering-leed-buildings-in-the-era-of-climate-change"&gt;no direct observable relationship to the real-world energy use&lt;/a&gt; in those buildings. Models of “embodied carbon” in building materials (and other consumer goods) are by nature &lt;a href="https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/confronting-embodied-carbons-data-problem-how-do-we-know-where-we-stand/#"&gt;arbitrary and incomplete&lt;/a&gt;, and reliably fail to take account of second-order market effects. (E.g.: Preventing U.S.-based power plants from burning coal could easily turn out to be bad for greenhouse-gas emissions globally, because lower demand from relatively clean U.S. plants reduces price pressure on coal, encouraging consumption by operators of relatively dirty plants in China, India, etc.) And a great deal of our economic policy debate (as about minimum-wage laws) is shaped by mathematical modeling that cannot be empirically evaluated, because doing so would require a comparison between measurable outcomes and non-measurable counterfactuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I write this not because I’m interested in side cases, but because I believe the overall context—the habits of American thinking about public affairs—is necessary for understanding what went wrong with COVID and why it is likely, if not inevitable, that we will repeat the mistakes every time we are faced with a similar episode of social stress. Zweig writes: “One thing is clear: the school closures and broader harms unnecessarily and unfairly inflicted upon America’s children were overdetermined.” An &lt;em&gt;overdetermined&lt;/em&gt; effect is one that has more than one cause. The COVID mess is largely behind us—but the mess behind the mess, the &lt;em&gt;ur&lt;/em&gt;-mess, remains. Those overdetermining factors are likely to create similar pathways to error in very different kinds of policy contexts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book is published by the MIT Press, a major academic publisher, so it is of course incompetently edited, and the prose is dreadful in places—i.e., about average for a book of this type in our time. (Cuomo “wore a dark navy suit with a crimson tie and crisp white shirt. He sat erect. His tie had a perfect knot, and hung perfectly centered. The lines of his jacket’s lapels formed a tight V down his torso and angled at the top to shoulder pads that jutted stiffly outward like the wing serifs in the Van Halen logo.” Ye gods.) The subtitle is &lt;em&gt;American Schools, the Virus, and a Story of Bad Decisions&lt;/em&gt;, and while there were a lot of destructive and costly policies imposed in response to COVID, this book is, as advertised, almost exclusively about school closures. The author is a father and plainly was annoyed—and pained, and worried—by what his own children went through. The damage done will probably last a long time, if not a lifetime, for children whose lives were disrupted by an extraordinary degree of isolation and inactivity during the COVID shutdowns, and it is natural that the situation of children should rise to the top of our concerns. But other changes—including the further aggrandizement of federal executive power, the precedent of extraordinary economic interventions, massive government spending and a large increase in public debt, inflation, etc.—may in the end prove more destructive. And all of those factors will interact in complex ways with the radicalization of the right noted in the opening section of this review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From time to time, I will speak to someone who has undergone a midlife political transformation and ask him about what happened to make that come to pass. I am surprised by how many times I have heard conservative men say that they were radicalized—some even use the word &lt;em&gt;radicalized&lt;/em&gt;—by the Brett Kavanaugh affair, in which Democrats attempted to personally ruin a Supreme Court nominee by means of bizarre and outlandish claims of sexual misdeeds he supposedly engaged in, some of them as a minor, depravities that were almost certainly wholly invented and unquestionably invented in part. It was a gross and contemptible affair, but if you have made it to 40 or 50 and have been paying attention to American politics, even casually, you’ve seen a lot of that sort of thing. Some people are just walking around in the world—or scrolling through Facebook—looking for a reason to get radicalized. They already have attained the necessary emotional state, and what remains is to fixate on a defensible pretext. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But 9/11 wasn’t like that. The financial crisis wasn’t like that. January 6 wasn’t like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And COVID wasn’t like that, either, though it is easy to get carried away with criticisms that are generally well-founded. At one point in his book, Zweig marvels and despairs that certain public health authorities are staffed disproportionately by people who describe themselves as risk-averse, as though this disproportionality were somehow self-evidently a problem in and of itself. I have written a good deal about variation in personal and group risk aversion as a factor in our public life, and I believe it is an underappreciated motive factor in our politics. But it will not do to treat attitudes toward risk at variance with one’s own as obviously mistaken—or, really, even as mistaken at all: People are allowed to decide for themselves how they &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; about risk, whether the subject is a potentially (if rarely) dangerous infectious disease such as COVID or investing in securities when saving for retirement or taking out a variable-rate mortgage. Better public policies would allow more people to organize their lives in ways that reflect their own risk tolerance—except for the niggling fact that this also requires a community with the discipline to allow those who would enjoy the rewards of high risk tolerance to also bear its costs, which we Americans have been patently unwilling to do for a generation. People who find it difficult to be libertarians when it comes to the health insurance market are unlikely to take a libertarian approach to an epidemic. The results of the 2024 election very strongly suggest that Americans want to be micromanaged, that they desire to have an all-powerful leader who will tell them from whom they may buy a pair of flip-flops and whose flip-flops are &lt;em&gt;verboten&lt;/em&gt;, or at least taxed to bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mass democracy is a petri dish, and what grows in it is stupidity, a virus far more dangerous than SARS-CoV-2. We have the means to contain it—and to let democracy play its natural and necessary role as part of a healthy political ecosystem—but we are facing an epidemic, and our defenses are being overrun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;

	A new &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5199076" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; models the impact of the implosion of U.S.-funded &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/disease/" id="auto-tag_disease" data-tag="disease"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; treatment and prevention in the developing world — and suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/elon-musk/" id="auto-tag_elon-musk" data-tag="elon-musk"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/marco-rubio/" id="auto-tag_marco-rubio" data-tag="marco-rubio"&gt;Marco Rubio&lt;/a&gt; will go down as among history’s greatest monsters if funding and effective administration are not restored.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In short: Tens of millions will die, millions of them children. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The second Trump administration began by &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/u-s-foreign-aid-freeze-dissolution-of-usaid-timeline-of-events/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;driving a stake&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-musk-interview-usaid-humanitarian-collapse-1235259251/"&gt;the heart&lt;/a&gt; of America’s foreign aid programs. Led by Musk, and enabled by Secretary of State Rubio, the U.S. Agency for International Development (&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/usaid/" id="auto-tag_usaid" data-tag="usaid"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt;) has been shuttered, and its life-saving programs in global health either defunded or thrown into disarray.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The new paper is not yet finalized or peer-reviewed; it was published as part of a project called &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5199076" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preprints with The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But it offers a first glimpse of the potential impact of the Trump administration’s cut-and-run approach to foreign aid — fueled by lies and red-pill conspiracy theories promoted by Musk about USAID being a “&lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1896930796310806835" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;radical left&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886102414194835755?lang=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;criminal&lt;/a&gt;” organization that deserved to be sent through the “&lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886307316804263979?lang=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wood chipper&lt;/a&gt;.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The study models the collapse of nearly $13 billion in U.S. funding for health programs in developing countries, including for the treatment and prevention of &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/hiv/" id="auto-tag_hiv" data-tag="hiv"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and tuberculosis; family planning; and maternal and child health. It forecasts the increase in global death and suffering through 2040 if this funding — which accounts for nearly a quarter of global donor investment — is zeroed out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The findings shock the conscience. Cessation of U.S. aid will lead to people in poor countries dying, in genocidal proportions, of preventable and treatable diseases. That includes more than 15 million additional deaths from HIV/&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/aids/" id="auto-tag_aids" data-tag="aids"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;, more than 2 million additional casualties from tuberculosis, and nearly 8 million additional children dead of other maladies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The impact on family planning is similarly stark — with tens of millions of new unplanned pregnancies (ranging between 40-55 million). Counter to the administration’s stated “pro-life” agenda, the collapse of American aid is projected to lead to as many as 16 million “unsafe abortions.”



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	According to the study, this mass suffering would be avoided by continuing U.S. funding on a “status quo” level from 2024 commitments. (Current funding for these programs represents about 0.2 percent of America’s &lt;a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;$6.75 trillion&lt;/a&gt; in annual federal spending.)

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The deadliest projected impact comes from the hobbling of PEPFAR, or the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — an enormous humanitarian accomplishment of the George W. Bush presidency that has made anti-retroviral medication widely available in the developing world, particularly in African countries hardest hit by HIV. The program has been credited with &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar-latest-global-results-factsheet-dec-2024/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;saving tens of millions of lives&lt;/a&gt; and preventing HIV transmission to nearly 8 million children since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The GOP-led Congress shares blame here, too. PEPFAR’s authorization &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/pepfar-misses-reauthorization-deadline-whats-next-global-hiv-fight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;expired&lt;/a&gt; in March, and the current Congress has &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/pepfar-misses-reauthorization-deadline-whats-next-global-hiv-fight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;provided funding&lt;/a&gt; only through September — throwing the entire program’s future into doubt. Regardless of appropriated funds, however, the chaotic governance of Trump, Musk, and Rubio has monkey-wrenched the program on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	PEPFAR was supposed to be exempt from a 90-day funding “pause” the administration imposed on most foreign aid, but USAID administered a majority of PEPFAR aid and the agency now no longer exists, with its chipped remains being swept into the &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/state-department/" id="auto-tag_state-department" data-tag="state-department"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt;. International partners on the ground in places like South Africa have likened the Trump-Musk era to being &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77887npl2mo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;“pushed off a cliff.”&lt;/a&gt; The George W. Bush Presidential Center has blasted the new administration for having “&lt;a href="https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/two-minute-take-pepfar-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;gravely undermined PEPFAR&lt;/a&gt;.”



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The future of U.S. funding to prevent and treat tuberculosis, as well child and maternal health programs, is similarly uncertain. (By one estimate, a Trump freeze on TB funding has already killed &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/30/health/tuberculosis-impact-usaid-funding-intl-scli/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;11,000 people&lt;/a&gt;.) This gutting of medical aid comes atop the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/usaid-doge-children-starvation/682484/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;deadly havoc&lt;/a&gt; caused by the suspension of food aid to relieve famine in the world’s poorest countries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The authors of the preprint paper are stark in their warning about the impact of continued cuts, insisting that a U.S. withdrawal from its 2024 commitments “would reverse decades of progress in global health” and send levels of deaths and disease soaring to levels not seen since the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to ending a marriage, women are often the ones who make the first move.

Men report more desire for marriage than women and it’s been known to boost their health, career prospects and even life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For women, however, the trade-offs are murkier. Unmarried women often thrive more emotionally and physically than their married peers, while unmarried men face higher risks of loneliness, poor health and early death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/19485506241287960" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.1177/19485506241287960" aria-label="research"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.1177/19485506241287960"&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that women fare far better at being single than men do, with higher levels of satisfaction with their relationship status, life satisfaction, sexual satisfaction and a lower level of desire to have a partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, men’s reliance on marriage often runs so deep that they are less likely to initiate divorce, even when they’re unhappy with their partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are four reasons why men may find it difficult to leave a marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. They Feel Tied To Their Children&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many men, the choice to stay is not necessarily about their love for their partner, but rather a strong sense of responsibility towards their children. They may feel that leaving would mean failing their family, especially their children, even if the relationship itself no longer feels fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09649069.2021.1953857" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09649069.2021.1953857" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09649069.2021.1953857"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Social Welfare and Family Law&lt;/em&gt; exploring separated fathers’ understanding of “home,” many men described it not just as a physical space, but as a combination of emotions, relationships, routines and surroundings. Despite their efforts to engage in meaningful activities and create emotionally supportive environments, these fathers often experienced a sense of loss or insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their children didn’t always view their homes as their “main” home and often identified with their mother’s home as their “real home.” This perception made some fathers feel that their parenting efforts might not be fully recognized or valued. When their children weren’t present, the house often felt empty, which made them feel like home only truly existed when the children were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This emotional reality of feeling invisible or &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/07/3-reasons-behind-maternal-gatekeeping-according-to-a-psychologist/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/07/3-reasons-behind-maternal-gatekeeping-according-to-a-psychologist/" target="_self" aria-label="secondary"&gt;secondary&lt;/a&gt; is one many married men quietly contend with. So, even in the face of an unhappy relationship, they may choose to stay, driven more by duty, guilt or cultural expectations than by emotional connection or personal satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;2. They Fear The Loss Of Stability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many men, divorce brings not just emotional upheaval but also profound uncertainty about the future. Financial instability, loneliness and the disruption of familiar routines fuel a fear of the unknown. The prospect of starting over can feel overwhelming, compounded by the &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/14/3-reasons-the-sunk-cost-fallacy-keep-us-stuck-in-bad-relationships/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/14/3-reasons-the-sunk-cost-fallacy-keep-us-stuck-in-bad-relationships/" target="_self" aria-label="sunk-cost fallacy"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/14/3-reasons-the-sunk-cost-fallacy-keep-us-stuck-in-bad-relationships/"&gt;sunk-cost fallacy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of abandoning a long-term investment in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research highlights this tension. A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13607863.2024.2377264#abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13607863.2024.2377264#abstract" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13607863.2024.2377264#abstract"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Aging &amp;amp; Mental Health&lt;/em&gt; found that older divorcees often experience freedom and loneliness simultaneously. While some described liberation from unhappy marriages and the chance to pursue suppressed desires, others grappled with isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, men’s post-divorce trajectories differ from that of women’s. A 2018 &lt;em&gt;Sociological Inquiry &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soin.12253" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soin.12253" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soin.12253"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; revealed that men are more likely to seek remarriage, reflecting a persistent reliance on marriage for care and companionship. Women, by contrast, are more reluctant to marry, fearing more caregiving burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings underscore a paradox: men may stay in unfulfilling marriages due to fear of instability, yet they also depend on the institution emotionally. Even when divorce offers relief, the desire to rebuild marital bonds persists. This suggests that marriage remains a primary anchor for emotional security for many men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They’re Conditioned To Suppress Emotions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many men are not taught how to express vulnerability or even recognize emotional dissatisfaction, leading them to normalize their discontent. Over time, emotional suppression can cause men to accept unhappiness as “just a part of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2015 &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407515574466" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407515574466" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407515574466"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Social and Personal Relationships &lt;/em&gt;suggests that when husbands suppress emotions, it harms relationship satisfaction, particularly early in marriage. As dissatisfaction grows, it alters how spouses manage emotions — often leaving both husbands and wives emotionally disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, this dynamic can create a sense of entrapment. Some men, despite feeling deeply unhappy, struggle to leave, either because they refuse to voice their needs or because they fear the consequences. For those from traditional backgrounds, divorce may be seen as failure or weakness, further locking them into unfulfilling marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They Lack Support Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While men tend to report having more same-sex friendships than women, these relationships &lt;a href="https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1978.tb02543.x?saml_referrer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1978.tb02543.x?saml_referrer" aria-label="are often not very close"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1978.tb02543.x?saml_referrer"&gt;are often not very close&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, intimate or emotionally open. Researchers suggest that several factors prevent emotional closeness between men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be due to societal expectations tied to traditional male roles — such as the pressure to compete, a fear of being perceived as weak, discomfort with vulnerability and homophobia — as well as a lack of positive role models for male emotional connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, they often do not find the tools or safe spaces to open up. This may make them feel like being in a dysfunctional relationship is better than separating from their partner and facing isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men’s reluctance to leave unhappy marriages is rarely about one factor. It’s an entanglement of emotional suppression, fear of loneliness, cultural expectations and the absence of strong support systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many stay out of habit or the hope that things will return to how they once were. But holding on to memories or enduring emotional strain in silence only deepens the wound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What men need is understanding and encouragement to redefine masculinity so that they feel safe enough to open up to others. They need to believe that taking care of others doesn’t mean neglecting themselves and that choosing emotional honesty is not a sign of weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Stimulating either of a pair of crucial nerves that carry messages from the brain to several major organs could be an effective way to treat people with severe  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="158509" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers conducted a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="158509" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; on 493 adults whose major depression hadn't previously &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/treatment-for-depression-changes-the-very-structure-of-the-brain-scientists-find"&gt;responded to treatment&lt;/a&gt;. Participants were fitted with a device capable of stimulating one of their vagus nerves, which was then activated in half the group to transmit signals to areas of their brain that regulate moods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessments were carried out for roughly ten months, after which participants who received the stimulation treatment showed improvements in their &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007"&gt;depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, in their quality of life, and in their ability to carry out the daily tasks of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147563" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147563" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/VagusNerve.jpg" alt="Vagus nerves" class="wp-image-147563 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/VagusNerve.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/VagusNerve-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147563" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;There are left and right vagus nerves in our bodies. (Benote/iStock/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On average, each patient had already tried 13 treatments that failed to help them before they enrolled in the trial, and they had spent more than half of their lives sick with depression," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/vagus-nerve-stimulation-relieves-severe-depression/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Charles Conway, a professor of psychiatry at Washington University in St Louis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But despite that super-high level of sustained illness, we still see  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="158509" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt;, measurable improvements in depressive symptoms, quality of life and functional outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While VNS &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/vagus-nerve-stimulation-relieves-severe-depression/"&gt;has shown&lt;/a&gt; promise for treating depression before, evidence of its success &lt;a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(05)00620-7/abstract"&gt;hasn't always&lt;/a&gt; been clear cut, leaving treatment difficult to afford for many in the US on insurance cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some reasons to be cautious. Based on the study's primary measure of depressive symptoms, the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), there were no differences between the treatment and non-treatment groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few participants from either group reported a full remission in their depression, and it's also worth noting the study was partly funded and supported by LivaNova USA, which manufactures a VNS therapy system for patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with those caveats in mind though, the study's results are promising, particularly when it comes to helping people escape the mental paralysis that can come along with major depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158511" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158511" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DepressedManLyingDown.jpg" alt="Vagus Nerve Stimulation Shows Lasting Effects in People With Severe Depression" class="size-full wp-image-158511" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DepressedManLyingDown.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DepressedManLyingDown-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DepressedManLyingDown-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158511" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mental paralysis can occur with major depression.

&lt;p&gt;"The nice thing about vagus nerve stimulation, we know from other studies, is that when the patient responds, the effects usually stick," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/vagus-nerve-stimulation-relieves-severe-depression/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Conway.&lt;/p&gt;

												&lt;p&gt;Ryo Tatsuki, a Japanese manga artist known as “Japan’s Baba Vanga,” gained attention for predicting the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in her 1999 comic The Future As I See It.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wrote about an unknown virus emerging around 2020, reaching its peak in April. This prediction closely matched the real outbreak that began in late 2019 and peaked with deadly waves in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same comic, Tatsuki warned that the virus would disappear but return about ten years later, suggesting a possible comeback around 2030. As this year approaches, her forecast is being discussed again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not confirmed by science, the comic has stirred curiosity, especially as experts remain alert to new health threats around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Tatsuki receives her visions through dreams, health experts are focused on real risks like “Disease X,” H5N1 bird flu, and other global viruses. Preparations for future pandemics are already underway.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When speech pathologist Vanessa Abraham began to feel ill in 2019, she thought she had a bad case of the flu. She was exhausted and her body ached. Her voice was raspy. She was prescribed antibiotics, but they didn't help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week later, Abraham woke up in the middle of the night and tried to stand. She collapsed to the floor, struggling to breathe. Her husband took her to an area hospital, where Abraham was taken to the ICU and intubated. The ventilator helped her breathe but left her unable to speak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors didn't know what was causing her symptoms. Two days after being admitted, she was transferred to UC San Diego Health, a larger hospital. That's where she met Dr. Jared Rosen, then a medical student on an ICU rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Abraham was in the ICU, doctors suggested multiple diagnoses, but none fit. Even scarier than the lack of answers was her continued intubation. She was unable to speak or eat. She was fighting paralysis that left her unable to move much of her body. Her neck was so weak that she couldn't raise her head without it flopping like a newborn baby's, Rosen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I was very aware of what was going on," Abraham told CBS News. "It was beyond the worst experience I could have ever imagined myself being in."&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham said the only thing that helped relieve her anxiety during this time was the long hours Rosen would spend at her bedside, doing his best to keep her spirits up. As a medical student, he had fewer responsibilities than other members of her care team and was able to spend more time with Abraham. They also worked to develop communication methods Abraham could use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After several weeks, Abraham's symptoms began to improve. She was taken off the ventilator. After a month, she was released from the ICU. But doctors were still no closer to understanding what had caused her paralysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no official label or term for what I was having. The fear of not knowing was terrifying," Abraham said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diagnosing a rare form of an unusual condition &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being discharged from the ICU, Abraham still had weakness that left her unable to lift her right arm and made eating difficult, so she spent time in inpatient physical therapy. Even after that, she needed outpatient follow-up, as well as more specialized care like swallowing and voice therapy. She battled severe anxiety and depression. At times, she felt so overwhelmed that she considered taking her own life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;
    
                                    
      &lt;span class="img embed__content"&gt;&lt;img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/04/18/8df396ab-07d5-4bb3-a59f-bd82e7288719/thumbnail/1240x930/b7de61408d0c723b1095ddba34d777b4/vanessa-rehab-2.png?v=04a4ba26f526ed8207f014fe1018c4aa#" alt="vanessa-rehab-2.png " loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night, she searched for Rosen online and found his email address. Abraham wrote and asked if he remembered her. When he responded and said that he did, it "brought tears" to her eyes and "sparked some level of joy" that helped her have hope. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That hope carried her through the next several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, four months after her symptoms began, Abraham was diagnosed with a form of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological disorder where the fibers around the nerves deteriorate and cause paralysis. In most cases, the paralysis starts in the legs and works its way upwards, according to Dr. Kiril Kiprovski, a neurologist and director of the Division of Neuromuscular Medicine at NYU Langone. Abraham had contracted the condition's even rarer pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant, which attacks the muscles in the diaphragm and throat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The variant is "very difficult to diagnose," Kiprovski said. There's no one test to determine if a person has Guillain-Barré syndrome or any of its variants, so doctors rely on clinical presentations. But they may not be familiar with the condition, Kiprovski said, because of its rarity. One person per 78,000 is diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome annually, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15838-guillain-barre-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Only about 3% of those patients are diagnosed with the pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant, researchers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6472218/#ref2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome or a variant of it tend to improve on their own, as Abraham did, Kiprovski said. Once Abraham was diagnosed, she was able to start receiving intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, where donor antibodies are given to a patient to strengthen their immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"It takes time"  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abraham continued her slow recovery. Having a name for what was happening to her helped her accept the laborious process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had to accept in my own head that this is going to be something that's just going to take time," Abraham said. "And that's how neuro diseases work. It takes time for your body to regenerate and heal." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years later, Abraham still has neuromuscular weakness, but can go about much more of her daily routine. She is back at work, where her voiceless experience in the ICU informs her interactions with patients whose speech has been compromised. She spends as much time as possible in the gym, working to strengthen her body. She also stayed in touch with Rosen, who is now finishing a fellowship in critical care medicine at the University of California's Davis Medical Center. He told CBS News that Abraham's case inspired him to study that area of medicine. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham's recovery hasn't just been physical. She started attending a support group for people who have trauma after time in the ICU. The experience has helped her recover from the fear of those weeks on a ventilator. She has worked to raise awareness for the benefits of such groups. She also wrote a memoir detailing her experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's so much more to recovery than just getting strong again," Abraham said. &lt;/p&gt;

She did. “It just came out of nowhere,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3QYDKWNEQZGYVL6QAUUSXKHDKA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rhoton, now 43, a software marketer in Boston, went to an ear, nose and throat specialist who told him he had a deviated septum, a common condition when the cartilage and the septum — the bone partition separating the nostrils — is “off center.” He recommended corrective surgery, and Rhoton agreed. The doctor also suggested a second procedure at the same time, a near-total removal of a turbinate in each nostril. Turbinates are small structures — three on each side — that cleanse, warm and humidify the air when it is drawn into the nose. But they can become inflamed and enlarged — the case with Rhoton — and doctors sometimes reduce or remove them to improve breathing when sprays and other measures are ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NAV4NPTVJZE23KLQP35J4AUV2U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The doctor told Rhoton that the surgery was routine and low-risk. He had no idea that instead of breathing better, the opposite would occur, prompting life-altering symptoms — constant nasal congestion, sleep disturbances, crushing fatigue and brain fog, anxiety, and weight gain. It took nearly six years and visits to 17 doctors, some of whom told him he was imagining things, before one of them finally identified the problem and offered a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5C4PJF3JP5GKHLC2ARV73SD4LE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“My symptoms made daily life a struggle simply to function,” he says. “It’s hard to believe that it took so many doctors and so much time to figure this out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="DF5Z5VPWEZCZ5BKWHNKEHDLBOY" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="DF5Z5VPWEZCZ5BKWHNKEHDLBOY"&gt;Congestion, burning and no sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WQBSSZVQDFAL3PMTIRR4TLPTAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rhoton’s initial surgery took place in April 2018. The doctor corrected the septum and removed most of the “inferior” turbinate — the largest of the three — from each nostril. &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-treatments/n/nasal-surgery/types/turbinate-reduction.html#:~:text=Turbinates%20are%20small%20structures%20inside%20the%20nose,passes%20through%20the%20nostrils%20into%20the%20lungs."&gt;Turbinate reduction&lt;/a&gt; is a common  procedure used to improve airflow, with a success rate of 82 percent, according to the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3XSBUENOKVDSJHRMYBIQ2NA6YY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Over the course of three months, Rhoton developed a worsening cascade of symptoms. He felt like he could no longer breathe through his nose. His nasal passages became congested and crusted, with a nagging burning sensation. “I felt like I was suffocating,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M6Y4AEQDLNAI7PNBUKHYF7KW3E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He had to breathe through his mouth, almost like he had a persistent cold that wouldn’t go away. He couldn’t sleep and became extremely sleepy during the day. The constant fatigue left him with no energy or motivation. He became anxious and started eating junk food. He gained weight. And, to his frustration, the whistling resumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-testid="quote" class="wpds-c-hqmxme wpds-c-hqmxme-fDUVQq-showBorder-true wpds-c-hqmxme-iPJLV-css article-quote relative border-box font-light black font--headline mr-lg-mod-ns"&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="TGXPV5MW2NBIFOCIIWH3VRPM5Y" data-apitype="text" data-qa="article-quote" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;“I felt like I was suffocating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="wpds-c-jFMeKj"&gt;— Bradley Rhoton&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="62Y3FZ4H55BLVKMURBTY22WWX4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most distressingly, he felt too tired to play with his sons, now 5 and 2. “It was like I was on a two-hour battery,” he says. “I wanted to do fun things with my kids, but I was so diminished that I couldn’t care for them. I’d fall asleep in the lawn chair while I was supposed to be watching them play outside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WM5OYPVNYVAPVMFEVGCUYFGV44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He’d never had sleeping problems, but now he’d nod off during work because he couldn’t sleep at night. “I’d be on a call and fall asleep,” he says. “The person on the other end of the phone would ask: ‘Bradley, are you there?’ and I played it like it was a poor connection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HQXOWRJAOFGV5P6JVLPMLCMOW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He tried nasal sprays and other decongestants, saline irrigation, allergy medications, and antihistamines. None worked. He returned to the ENT doctor in October, who found a small hole in his septum, which he repaired, but Rhoton’s symptoms did not improve. In May, he had a small benign growth removed from one of his nostrils. That didn’t help, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q45PVMGNQRCTBJGCO6NKK623OM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Frustrated, over the next 18 months he sought help from other doctors, including his primary care physician and two new ENT specialists. “They told me my nose looked fine,” he says. “They said: ‘Your nose is wide open. Straight. Healed. There’s nothing wrong with you.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="FVN2G7PTNNCMPBVP5YSEEK3IRI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="FVN2G7PTNNCMPBVP5YSEEK3IRI"&gt;All in his head, sleep apnea?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TSR3KPXMRBCH5GASXUQF2RQIJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He began to wonder if some of the specialists he’d seen were right that “it was all in my head,” even though he’d expected the original surgery to go well and was surprised by the ensuing symptoms. He found it vexing that no one took his symptoms seriously. “It was an upsetting journey that raised questions about how the health-care system responds and the often overlooked psychological toll of being medically misunderstood,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3A7YAE6MIJG4DOVRK6ER6QCUQY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rhoton considered the possibility that his breathing problems — which at times were so bad that he couldn’t go out with friends, exercise or engage in his favorite hobbies, such as photography or playing hockey — actually might be unrelated to his nose and the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WGDPQGC7DFD3BGTXQLHR2TZ6IE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He saw a sleep specialist, thinking perhaps a sleep disorder was causing his disrupted sleep. The doctor diagnosed him with mild &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; and recommended  a &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/cpap#What-is-CPAP?"&gt;CPAP machine&lt;/a&gt;, which helps keep a person’s airways open, at night. He tried  but couldn’t stick with it because wearing a mask over his nose and mouth exacerbated his symptoms, and he felt like he was gasping for air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-testid="quote" class="wpds-c-hqmxme wpds-c-hqmxme-fDUVQq-showBorder-true wpds-c-hqmxme-iPJLV-css article-quote relative border-box font-light black font--headline mr-lg-mod-ns"&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="F2ULMDD7ZBG63HOHZ3GMNUMOHY" data-apitype="text" data-qa="article-quote" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;“It can be incredibly impactful to their well-being, their quality of life, including to their mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="wpds-c-jFMeKj"&gt;— Pryor Brenner, Washington, D.C., otolaryngologist &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="23NCTBQCPBHLLOXGMGIPEHFGNI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He then went to a cardiologist, who gave him a stress test and drew blood for lab work.

Das said he could not diagnose  Rhoton from afar, but the two discussed several possibilities, including a rare and debilitating disorder that sometimes occurs after turbinate surgery: “&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23170-empty-nose-syndrome"&gt;empty nose syndrome&lt;/a&gt;,” in which patients develop relentless and severe nasal congestion and significantly restricted breathing through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H34RV7CSVFBLPNBUAG6HFLLB2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;ENS is not a well-understood disorder and is a somewhat controversial diagnosis because of its counterintuitive nature, since turbinate surgery is meant to improve breathing, not make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AHM2EVSUTNF57MNCLPXZEAWCWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s unclear why some patients experience breathing problems following turbinate surgery, while most do not. Some experts think that anatomical differences among patients may play a role. Regardless, “it’s real,” says Pryor Brenner, a D.C. otolaryngologist who has seen only two ENS cases in 24 years among the more than 2,000 nasal surgeries he’s performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3HJSVVEC55EDPPI4WVZZ2ZZ7ZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I discuss the possibility of ENS with all my patients because it’s a major medical problem when it does occur,” he adds. “It can be incredibly impactful to their well-being, their quality of life, including to their mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SCRPLMLXTZE5RMOPMGUDGPIMQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some experts believe that ENS results from the loss during surgery of important turbinate tissue receptors that signal normal airflow. With key receptors gone, some “patients feel like they can’t breathe,” says Eugene Kern, clinical professor in the department of otolaryngology, head and neck surgery at the State University of New York at Buffalo. “They have to breathe through the mouth. You no longer get the feeling of normal breathing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BXJ34UFKKJCXBEU36YRTZOR2JM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kern identified the syndrome with a colleague in 1994 while working at the Mayo Clinic  and coined the name. He believes ENS occurs more frequently than known, although there are no reliable estimates available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3HH4Z6IOA5FRFN54GXD3KIPSSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While at Mayo, Kern treated nearly 250 ENS patients, all of whom had undergone turbinate surgery elsewhere. “I was seeing four or five patients a week,” Kern says, adding that it goes undiagnosed because many doctors “don’t understand the mechanism. It’s easy to diagnose when you know what you are looking for.

Das suggested Rhoton contact Jayakar Nayak, an ENT surgeon at Stanford University, who was using several effective novel treatment approaches and was also in Rhoton’s health insurance network. Nayak had published research articles on the condition and had a podcast about ENS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BQ7WPQDGJFBSRCNJOGPG55RVFU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This provided me with something I hadn’t felt in years,” Rhoton says. “Hope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y4FHQZRF65F4LFVQJDW7CJMWHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nayak, an expert in nasal and sinus disorders, says he has performed thousands of inferior turbinate reduction surgeries for nasal congestion over the years with no ill aftereffects, but acknowledges that problems can occur sporadically, making a diagnosis perplexing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4LAM6QVT4FFWBIXUZFQSFUFBDY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Inferior turbinate reduction for abnormally enlarged and obstructing turbinate tissue is a remarkably safe and effective procedure to help patients to breathe and sleep better,” he says, and unfortunately “we don’t know why ENS happens in a small group of people and not in others. I’ve seen similar levels of tissue loss in other patients who don’t have any ENS symptoms and are so happy with their breathing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SBMBWS3TKJHMVB7A4MXBI4L4CU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He also has received hundreds of referrals over the years to evaluate symptomatic patients for ENS, but only a fraction turn out to have the disorder, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="66UMDVMDMBCZDLG52A2JBFRKVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In Rhoton’s case, because his symptoms occurred right after the surgery, ENS was a likely diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R5NKNXWTXJFORGLJMSW6UKDGDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To confirm this, Nayak ran a series of tests when Rhoton came to see him last June. “We have a scoring system that lists the common symptoms of ENS with a maximum score of 30, with 30 being the worst,” Nayak recalls. “Bradley’s score was 26.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BF3OAWVVIJADVHGN2HF2HYVWYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The doctor performed a second diagnostic test by inserting cotton into various areas of Rhoton’s nose. When the cotton was placed in nostril areas where tissue was missing, “he was breathing like a normal person. He went from 26 to 2 on the scoring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YOIO77FWC5FLPL4IOJJP4FM6BY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nayak recalls that Rhoton “was so pleased, he was almost crying.

I finally can breathe through my nose again.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A752FGIYLRBBNFQJL3A7KVRU6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The next step was a series of injections — four or five in each nostril — with a gel made of carboxymethyl cellulose, a filler used in many pharmaceutical products. Although the temporary filler does not restore lost nerves and receptors or last forever, it improves airflow. A permanent solution for those who appear to be good candidates is surgery to implant rib cartilage (sanitized and irradiated material taken from cadaver sources) into nasal passages to replace missing turbinate tissue. While not a complete cure, it significantly reduces symptoms, Nayak’s research found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QC66HHKPKZE3TMISHD2X6NYMYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last September, Rhoton got the injections and improved substantially in the month that followed. “I could breathe through my nose. I could sleep. My mood improved. I felt motivated,” he says. “The difference was amazing.” He has had a follow-up series of injections when his breathing worsened again and is now leaning toward having the surgery, probably in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="73JESQUQGRBF7PYALGQGV7UHNU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And, he says, “I’m hopeful for the first time in nearly six years.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;If you feel like your seasonal allergies are getting worse every year, it's not just you. Warming from climate change is making the pollen season longer, and more people are going to the doctor each year looking for relief, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/lary.32124" target="_blank"&gt;research review&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;The Laryngoscope. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One study the reviewers looked at found the pollen season had already gotten 20 days longer in North America between 1990 and 2018, and several studies found an increase in average daily pollen concentrations. &lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are ways to keep the pollen from taking over your life. NPR asked doctors for tips to help you manage your spring allergies before they manage you.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story comes from NPR's &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Want more stories on the science of healthy living? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Keep the outside outside &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pollen can be carried in on just about any surface, warns Dr. Zachary Rubin a pediatric allergist and clinical immunologist who &lt;a href="https://drrubin.substack.com/" target="_blank"&gt;blogs about allergies&lt;/a&gt; and shares &lt;a href="https://linktr.ee/rubin_allergy?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAadZB16VfI48t4rNxPpq8LGfLlXSPCFs_gMO_ZloFK_Ods47Z08uMw6zELxkSw_aem_BhmrDvthdrUr_RrI6aDFBA" target="_blank"&gt;allergy-related tips on social media&lt;/a&gt;. Taking your shoes off and storing them in a closet or foyer is a good start, but there's more.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When you come home, "before you sit down on furniture or in your bed, you ideally should take off any clothes that would have been touching the outside world," Rubin says. Socks, pants, shirts all go directly in your laundry. Rubin also recommends taking a shower or a bath before bed to rinse pollen from your skin and hair.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When indoors, Rubin recommends keeping your windows and doors closed as much as possible. That may be a bummer if you love a spring breeze, but you're inviting pollen and mold into your house whenever you open the windows, says Rubin.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;If you're allergic to pollen, the stuff is more likely to float through windows on a dry and windy day. Rubin says rainy days are good for flushing pollen out of the air. But if you're allergic to mold, it's better to keep windows shut on rainy days too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you've just got to open those windows, Rubin says an indoor air purifier can provide some relief.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. Wipe down or bathe your pets&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you have a dog, cat or any pet who spends time outside, wipe the animal off whenever they come inside, says Rubin. You can pick up allergy-friendly wipes at pet stores. It's also worth giving pets more frequent baths to remove pollen, says Dr. Neelima Tummala, an ENT physician and clinical assistant professor in otolaryngology at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Keep your nose clean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First, look at when pollen counts are really high and try to avoid being outdoors during those times of day, advises Tummala. Right now we're in tree pollen season … and tree pollen tends to be highest in the mornings, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; Want to enjoy nature with fewer sneezes? It turns out the masks we got used to wearing to prevent COVID transmission "can be very helpful actually," says Rubin, when it comes to keeping out pollen and mold. He points to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7467086/" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; where health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic reported reduced allergy symptoms when they were wearing masks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's also a good idea to rinse out your nose when you get home, says Rubin. You can do that with a neti pot or a saline spray. If you go the neti pot route, be sure to use distilled water, or tap water that's been boiled and cooled down, Rubin cautions. (Water straight from the tap comes with a small risk of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/03/1160980794/neti-pot-safety-brain-eating-amoeba" target="_blank"&gt;sending an amoeba to eat your brain&lt;/a&gt; – eek!)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Know your meds and when to use what&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Different allergy medications treat different symptoms. Here are a few common ones, and what to know about how to use them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral and nasal antihistamines&lt;/strong&gt;. If you're experiencing itchy eyes, a runny nose, or sneezing, an oral antihistamine like Zyrtec, Claritin, or Allegra should help, Rubin says. Astepro is a nasal spray with antihistamine, which Rubin usually recommends pairing with a steroid spray. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steroid nasal sprays. &lt;/strong&gt;If you've got congestion or postnasal drip, that's where nasal sprays come in. Examples of common steroid sprays are Flonase, Nasacort and Nasonex.  However, "We don't always tell people to take [steroid sprays] year-round," says Rubin. So check with your physician about how long you should be using it. Nasal steroid sprays take a few weeks to kick in, notes Tummala. With pollen season starting earlier, "you may need to start your intranasal steroid spray earlier than you used to," so they'll be optimally effective, she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nasal decongestants&lt;/strong&gt;. If you're really stuffed up and need instant relief,  you may want to try  a nasal decongestant spray like Afrin or Vicks Sinex, Rubin says.  These sprays shrink the blood vessels in your nasal passages. But Rubin cautions against using them for more than 3 to 5 days at a time, because after you stop, you can develop a rebound nasal congestion that gets progressively worse. "You almost become dependent upon it and it's hard to get rid of," he warns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Nasal spray the right way &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;You're probably doing it wrong. I know I was. "A lot of people just naturally go&lt;em&gt;, snort, spray, snort&lt;/em&gt;. What that does is it just shoots the medicine to the back of your throat where you taste it. And if you taste it, you waste it," Rubin says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rubin_allergy/video/7219482513071148331" target="_blank"&gt;demonstrated how to use nasal spray properly&lt;/a&gt; in a TikTok that went viral. Here's his secret to getting it right:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;I tell people 'nose to toes.' So you look down and then you place the nozzle up, but then you tilt it slightly towards the ear on the same side as your nostril. And after you spray on each side, you look forward and breathe through your mouth. Breathe normally, maybe a slight inhalation through your nose, but you never snort it," Rubin advises.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Why aim towards the ear? The ear is connected to the back of the throat and nasal cavity through the eustachian tube, so decreasing inflammation in that area will lower the risk of getting fluid behind your ear. Pointing the spray bottle towards the ear also targets openings between your nasal passages and your sinuses, lowering your risk of developing a sinus infection, says Rubin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Be aware of factors that can worsen your allergic reaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rubin uses a concept called &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHjNoY8RLE0/" target="_blank"&gt;the allergy symptom threshold&lt;/a&gt; to explain how exposure to multiple allergens, along with other factors, can trigger symptoms.  "You could be exposed to one pollen grain and not sneeze, but if you're exposed to a thousand, you're going to sneeze because there's enough there that will activate the immune system," he explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That goes for different kinds of allergens too. For instance, last week I was in Washington D.C., contending with pollen from the lovely cherry blossoms outside, and my sister's cat Felicia indoors. My sinuses were not pleased.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It's like you have a cup and you're filling it with different allergens and exposures, says Rubin." (He &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHjNoY8RLE0/" target="_blank"&gt;illustrates the concept&lt;/a&gt; in another video.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other factors can also increase your likelihood of having an allergic reaction. For some people Rubin says, drinking alcohol lowers the threshold, and some are more vulnerable when they exercise, particularly outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you happen to be sick, "your immune system is aggravated and hyperactive," Rubin says, and more likely to respond to allergens. (It can also work the other way around – if mucus builds up in your sinuses because of allergies and you're less able to fend off a respiratory infection that comes your way, he says.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It goes back to reducing exposure, says Rubin: The more you can cut back your exposures to all kinds of allergens and irritants, the more successful you'll be at preventing an allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR's Maria Godoy contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Young adults who scored higher on right-wing authoritarianism had less gray matter volume in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in social reasoning. Meanwhile, those who endorsed more extreme forms of left-wing authoritarianism showed reduced cortical thickness in the right anterior insula, a brain area tied to empathy and emotion regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research aimed to better understand the brain-based traits that might underlie authoritarian thinking. Previous studies have documented the psychological characteristics associated with authoritarianism—such as impulsivity, dogmatism, and heightened sensitivity to threat—but few have examined whether these traits are reflected in brain structure. The authors were particularly interested in both left- and right-wing authoritarianism, as research has increasingly recognized that rigid, anti-democratic attitudes can be found at both ends of the political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research on ideological authoritarianism and other forms of radical political attitudes has been attracting growing attention,” said study author Jesús Adrián-Ventura, a professor at University of Zaragoza and member of &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pseudo-lab/home?authuser=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Pseudo-Lab Research Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, despite increasing reports on its psychological correlates, its integration with neurobiological data remains very limited, in particular regarding left-wing authoritarianism, which remains poorly represented in the current psychological literature. This led us to undertake a study on authoritarianism from a neuroscientific perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these questions, the researchers recruited 100 young adults in Spain, mostly university students between the ages of 18 and 30. Each participant completed a series of psychological questionnaires that measured political orientation, authoritarian beliefs, impulsivity, anxiety, and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers used updated scales that assess both &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_authoritarianism"&gt;traditional right-wing authoritarianism&lt;/a&gt; and a recently developed &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/large-study-indicates-left-wing-authoritarianism-exists-and-is-a-key-predictor-of-psychological-and-behavioral-outcomes/"&gt;measure of left-wing authoritarianism&lt;/a&gt;, which includes dimensions like anti-hierarchical aggression and top-down censorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using a high-resolution 3T scanner. The researchers focused on two structural features of the brain: gray matter volume, which reflects the density of neurons and connections in different brain regions, and cortical thickness, a measure of the depth of the brain’s outer layer. They used whole-brain statistical analyses to identify whether either of these features was associated with authoritarian beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, the results supported previous findings that people with authoritarian attitudes, regardless of political orientation, tend to act impulsively in emotionally charged situations. Both left-wing and right-wing authoritarians scored higher on “negative urgency,” a trait linked to impulsive actions under distress. However, left-wing authoritarianism—especially the tendency toward aggressive anti-establishment views—was also linked to higher levels of trait anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both left-wing and right-wing authoritarians act impulsively in emotionally negative situations, while the former tend to be more anxious,” Adrián-Ventura told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the neural level, the researchers found two key structural associations. First, higher scores on right-wing authoritarianism were related to smaller gray matter volume in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. This region is known to be involved in understanding others’ perspectives, making moral judgments, and navigating complex social situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right-wing authoritarianism is associated with a lower dorsomedial prefrontal cortex gray matter volume, a region involved in understanding others’ thoughts and perspectives,” Adrián-Ventura said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked activity in this region to political decision-making and reactions to conflicting information. The authors suggest that reduced volume in this area might reflect more rigid thinking styles or difficulties with cognitive flexibility among right-wing authoritarians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, individuals who scored high on the anti-hierarchical aggression component of left-wing authoritarianism showed lower cortical thickness in the right anterior insula. Interestingly, the same region has been implicated in studies examining reactions to political disagreement and emotional responses to moral violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reduced cortical thickness in the right anterior insula—a region associated with emotional empathy and behavioral inhibition—is linked to increased anti-hierarchical aggressive attitudes (i.e., the preference for violent actions and punishment against perceived authority structures) in the context of left-wing authoritarianism,” Adrián-Ventura explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These neurobiological results were very surprising. Due to the lack of prior studies, our approach was mainly exploratory and data-driven. Still, it is quite difficult to obtain significant results in MR studies when strict statistical thresholds are applied. The obtained medium-to-large effect sizes are therefore striking and demand further scrutiny.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further validate their findings, the researchers examined whether these brain differences were also associated with related political ideologies. The gray matter reductions in the prefrontal cortex correlated with higher scores on social dominance orientation, a belief system often linked to right-wing authoritarianism. Likewise, the thinning in the anterior insula was related to endorsement of radical feminist views, which share ideological ground with the anti-authority stance of left-wing authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study breaks new ground by identifying distinct neural correlates for both left-wing and right-wing authoritarianism, it is not without limitations. The sample was relatively homogenous, consisting mainly of young, educated individuals from a single European country. The findings may not generalize to older populations or to people in different cultural and political environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, new research would be needed to confirm and expand our results in different populations,” Adrián-Ventura noted. “This is particularly relevant in the domain of authoritarianism as this construct tends to manifest within a range of context-dependent determinants (i.e., salient forms of authoritarian attitudes in post-communist or Hispanic American countries, among others, often exhibit specific traits).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, because the study was cross-sectional, it cannot determine whether the brain differences cause authoritarian attitudes or result from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that authoritarian beliefs are not solely determined by brain anatomy. Instead, the structural differences may reflect long-standing cognitive and emotional patterns that interact with social and cultural influences. For example, people with a tendency to experience anxiety or act rashly under stress may be more drawn to authoritarian ideologies when they perceive the world as threatening or unstable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on these findings by examining how these brain structures function during political decision-making or when people are confronted with opposing views. Longitudinal studies may also help clarify whether changes in political ideology are associated with structural or functional shifts in the brain over time. Experimental studies could test whether interventions targeting emotion regulation or perspective-taking influence authoritarian attitudes and their neural underpinnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are dedicated to the scientific study of radical beliefs (e.g., authoritarianism, pseudoscientific doctrines, conspiracy theories, and interventions such as empathetic refutation),” Adrián-Ventura told PsyPost. “In the context of authoritarianism, our goal is to delineate a precise network of psychological associations and its neurocognitive profile. To this end, we will integrate novel behavioral and neuroimaging data—by means of structural and functional MRI—together with new experimental designs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.04.027"&gt;Authoritarianism and the brain: Structural MR correlates associated with polarized left- and right-wing ideology traits&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jesús Adrián-Ventura, Diego Avendaño, Anna Miró-Padilla, Anastasia Cherednichenko, César Ávila, Angelo Fasce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 10:00:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQYlVJUXpaMk1qM0V6ZEtNbU43ZTdEa1NrS2hvUG5YTEp1X0xscF9lOXNndEpRQTlOZGUzYjJWbDZZM24zR1dKWmJCOTlTTUJwcUI1UlZxOElYN0FzOFEzalJoNkg1NFR4ZGV0ajc2ZXJCREFsV0FWQjRmWWJ3d2xVYmlIaENjV2RGNHhXRER4WkthNWJnbFhUU1hBaWZkcXlNUHZoVFBB</guid></item><item><title>世界血液供应是否会成为气候变化的下一个受害者？ - Euronews.com | Will the world's blood supply be the next casualty of climate change? - Euronews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxOemZaWHpmZHdhQzRnV1lDWlBwckdaTHl6RmlnQmJpaUtHVVV4SVl6VjJOYWtYaHJTNGUxcUJPYkl0eU93NjRjY3E5ZEoteHhvOEFUVURGeFg3ZkVqZnRPeHdaVWg1S213QkpvZDdiUHdMRWJjRnVKSFl1TkJROWdiLW9kQ2ZldlJ4VFJ3WmwwQk43M2o1T3F0dG0yNGcyWFE5c1ptbDZWeE5PNXgxM3otY3dXRS1VMy05aldfbVhmWndya0s1MTVZU0djVHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-content c-article-content--health js-article-content poool-content"&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad-halfpage u-show-for-mobile-only"&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-halfpage_1" data-ad-type="halfpage" data-ad-position="1" class="c-ad__adzone advertising js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-ad__placeholder"&gt;&lt;img class="c-ad__placeholder__logo" src="https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-grey-6-180x22.svg" alt="" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climate change might impact the supply and demand chain when it comes to blood transfusions, a new study has found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Red Cross Lifeblood and the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) in Australia believe that blood-borne diseases as well as natural disasters are likely to disturb current patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As well as limiting the mobility of large numbers of people, these events disrupt the storage, safety, and transportation of blood which has a short shelf life," Dr Elvina Viennet, one of the researchers behind the study, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, 25 million blood units are transfused in Europe. They are needed for treatments of patients undergoing surgery, premature babies, victims of accidents, and patients living with chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Climate change may impact some infectious diseases that can be transmitted via blood and can prevent people from donating,” Viennet added, mentioning the potential intensification of mosquito-borne diseases such as Dengue Fever, West Nile Virus, and Malaria due to increased rainfall and warmer temperatures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warming temperatures are making cases of these diseases &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2024/05/15/heat-related-deaths-are-on-the-rise-in-europe-as-the-effects-of-climate-crisis-take-hold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;more common in Europe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, most notably dengue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Impact of extreme weather&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other conditions linked to climate change, such as "extreme weather, including high temperatures, cold exposure, and other climate fluctuations," could also narrow the pool of potential blood donors, according to the study published in &lt;a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flanplh%2Farticle%2FPIIS2542-5196(25)00051-8%2Ffulltext&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Coceane.duboust%40ext.euronews.com%7Cb813482294914b9ccbb408dd7cebfa85%7Ce59fa28a32ed49aca5a09c46118cfecf%7C0%7C0%7C638804075479126123%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=J4vQqEiDQF13tyQbJiaJFgFQTuUO1R0f5E2a0Fm7YrQ%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lancet Planetary Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-outstream_1" data-ad-type="outstream" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label js-adzone outstream"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These climatic changes can impact haemoglobin concentration, red blood cell counts, and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We could see new diseases emerge, and other health issues such as blood pressure and hydration, exacerbated by heat, as well as psychological distress and ‘climate anxiety’ impact donors," said Helen Faddy, an associate professor at UniSC and the study’s lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the same time, shifts in disease prevalence and natural disaster frequency could increase the demand for blood transfusions due to conditions such as pregnancy complications, cardiovascular disease, and sickle cell disease," she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers suggested potential mitigation strategies such as flexible and mobile blood centres, cell salvage - a form of autotransfusion - and international collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-id="adzone-native_1" data-ad-type="native" data-ad-position="1" class="advertising advertising--no-label advertising--native js-adzone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With rising sea levels increasing migration rates, it’s essential to have more blood donors from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, and to increase the number of people who give blood," Faddy said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Euronews.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 09:17:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizAFBVV95cUxOemZaWHpmZHdhQzRnV1lDWlBwckdaTHl6RmlnQmJpaUtHVVV4SVl6VjJOYWtYaHJTNGUxcUJPYkl0eU93NjRjY3E5ZEoteHhvOEFUVURGeFg3ZkVqZnRPeHdaVWg1S213QkpvZDdiUHdMRWJjRnVKSFl1TkJROWdiLW9kQ2ZldlJ4VFJ3WmwwQk43M2o1T3F0dG0yNGcyWFE5c1ptbDZWeE5PNXgxM3otY3dXRS1VMy05aldfbVhmWndya0s1MTVZU0djVHc</guid></item><item><title>根据胃肠病学家的说法，上午9点前要做6件事来帮助你排便- EatingWell | 6 Things to Do Before 9 A.M. to Help You Poop, According to Gastroenterologists - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxQTGY1aDhKTmllckd6UU84X1pFT3hoTHhDUU5zS1NzdjNPUDBkZHlzLU0zMllrTU1FTndLUnNzVFhKYlp6c2ZRdVRRY1gwODl3ZWxGRHNSQnZEZEVXdTZ2VEhaQ1pRYlJERFNPNUo1MVBCdG9DcUpzQmQxWE9rb2U0TFlhSVptX3I1NTlWdEpfNEs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Constipation is one of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms that people have. Many people have constipation and don’t complain because they think it is normal,” says &lt;a href="http://drashkanfarhadi.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ashkan Farhadi, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., board-certified gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The good news? You don’t have to wait until later in the day to go. If you struggle with irregularity or just want to get into a smoother routine, there are changes you can make to your morning routine to help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regular bowel movements are important for gut health—they’re how the body eliminates waste and toxins. And when your gut is healthy, your whole body benefits. Research shows that gut health is closely tied to metabolic, brain, lung and heart function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;We talked with three gastroenterologists who shared 6 things you can do before 9 a.m. to help get your bowels moving. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-drink-a-warm-beverage"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Drink a Warm Beverage &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hydration makes stools easier to pass.&lt;a href="https://www.integratedgic.com/blog/supriya-rao" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;“You can try drinking a glass of warm water to hydrate and soften your stools or a cup of coffee to help stimulate your digestive tract,” says &lt;a href="https://www.integratedgic.com/blog/supriya-rao" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Supriya Rao, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, board-certified gastroenterologist. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Farhadi agrees, “Coffee is very effective for initiating that gastrocolic reflex which stimulates the bowel movement.” While you’re waiting for your coffee to brew, drink a glass of warm water. Try this combination for a few days to see if it helps. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-go-for-a-walk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Go for a Walk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walking in the morning not only helps reduce stress levels, but it can also get things moving in your digestive tract. “Drink a hot beverage and go for a good walk. This stimulates the gastrocolic reflex, which sends a neurological signal from your stomach to your enteric nervous system and back to your colon, helping to stimulate a bowel movement,” says DaVee. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it’s tempting to check emails or scroll on social media during your walk, DaVee recommends keeping your phone at home—or at least tucked away in your pocket.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When you are walking, do something to relax, such as listening to the birds or looking at the sunrise. . .This [may] help activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which signals to your body it's time to stimulate gastrointestinal smooth muscle activity, relax sphincter muscles (which hold back digestive contents in the stomach and small intestine) and move food out from your stomach and stool from your colon,” he explains.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-massage-your-tummy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Massage Your Tummy &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Massages are another strategy for relaxing your body and your mind. “Tummy massage can massage your intestines and promote peristalsis,” says Roa. In one study, abdominal massages increased the frequency of bowel movements, reduced symptoms of difficulty, improved stool properties and had a positive impact on quality of life in people with constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are several techniques you can try, but a good way to start is by lying flat on your back with your knees up. From there, apply gentle pressure with your hands on your belly in a circular clockwise motion for about 10–15 minutes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As with any massage, stop if you feel sharp pains and make an appointment with a healthcare provider to rule out an underlying medical reason for your discomfort.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-establish-a-schedule"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Establish a Schedule &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Especially in the morning, it’s easy to rush around, ignoring the urge to go to the bathroom—you’ll go once you get to work, right? While easier said than done, try not to hold off on your morning bathroom visit. Not pooping when your body is signaling that it needs to go can disrupt your body’s natural rhythm, potentially leading to constipation. Instead, work towards establishing and maintaining a regular morning bathroom schedule.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Farhadi describes it as a “meeting with the bathroom.” He says, “The bowel needs preparation, and the body likes order and timing. If we can prove to the gut that we are there for it at a certain time, it will be ready.” He suggests setting a certain time that works for you and staying consistent with it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; He describes a sample schedule, “Let’s say you go to work at 8:00 am and from 8–8:30 you answer emails. After that, you have your bathroom meeting. At 8:30 am, sit on the toilet and do nothing for 15 minutes. After 10–15 days, the body gets the understanding that you are there for it, and things will [hopefully] start moving without effort.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-find-ways-to-relax"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Find Ways to Relax &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stress is part of life, but chronic stress can negatively affect your health. “Your gut is often referred to as your second brain. There is a bidirectional communication between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. Stress can play a big role in your bowel habits. Finding ways to relax, like deep breathing, yoga or mindfulness, can make a big difference,” says Rao. Take a few minutes shortly after you wake up to engage in a mindfulness routine. This can be as simple as taking a few rounds of deep breaths or practicing a short yoga flow. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-eat-a-high-fiber-breakfast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Eat a High Fiber Breakfast &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Breakfast isn’t just important for fueling your morning—it can also help keep your bathroom visits regular. “Putting food in the stomach gets the colon moving,” says Farhadi. While any food will stimulate the digestive tract, a high-fiber breakfast has particular advantages for staying regular. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt;—the indigestible part of carbohydrate found in plant-based foods—helps soften and adds bulk to stool, helping it move through the intestinal tract. Eating a high-fiber diet is a key component of the protocol that DaVee recommends to his patients. “[Fiber] primes your system so that complete spontaneous bowel movements are possible. I recommend a high-fiber diet that contains foods such as brown rice, quinoa, greens, beans and mushrooms,” he says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-a-normal-bowel-movement-and-why-is-it-important"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What is a Normal Bowel Movement and Why is It Important? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to bowel movements, “normal” looks different for everyone. “Everything from a few bowel movements a day to one bowel movement every few days is within the range of normal,” says &lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/igut/2022/12/06/r-tomas-davee-md-msci-fasge/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;R. Tomás DaVee, M.D, MSCI, FASGE&lt;/a&gt;, chief for gastroenterology at Memorial Hermann Greater Heights Hospital and director for the Heartburn and Reflux Program (HARP). Instead of focusing on frequency, many doctors focus on ease. He adds, “Constipation-type bowel movements are associated with stools that look like pellets or dry, very hard, compacted stools. Ideally, stools should be soft.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not moving your bowels as frequently as you’re used to can lead to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating, straining and rectal or abdominal pain, says DaVee. While anyone can experience constipation, people with proctitis, irritable bowel syndrome or scar tissue in the intestinal tract may be particularly prone to harder-to-pass stools. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking a warm beverage, going for a short walk, eating a high-fiber breakfast or simply making a date with the bathroom are easy strategies you can do before 9 a.m. to help you poop. “[Regular bowel movements] show us that your digestive system is working well and that you are likely eating a well-balanced diet with enough fiber and hydration,” says Rao. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just remember: &lt;em&gt;your &lt;/em&gt;normal is unique. If you’re frequently constipated or find yourself straining, don’t ignore it. A healthcare provider can help uncover the cause and create a personalized plan to make things smoother—literally. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
