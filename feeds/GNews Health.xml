            A deadly measles outbreak in Texas &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak-declared-over"&gt;ended in August&lt;/a&gt;, but outbreaks in other parts of the United States continue to add hundreds of new measles cases to this year’s record national total.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00043b6nnvd0clai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been an average of 27 new measles cases reported each week since the end of August, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The annual total – now up to 1,563 cases since January – is the highest by a significant margin since measles was declared eliminated in the US a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk2wqse00003b6qwyafchyu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s a &lt;a href="https://newalbanyohio.org/news/2025/10/confirmed-case-of-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;new outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Ohio, a recent &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles100125.html" target="_blank"&gt;surge&lt;/a&gt; in cases in Minnesota and more than 150 unvaccinated schoolchildren in South Carolina are in quarantine because of an ongoing outbreak there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00053b6nah7gqtko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before this year, the US had recorded only 10 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coca/media/pdfs/2025/COCA-Call-Slides_09.11.25_Combined-FINALV2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;large measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; – defined by the CDC as more than 50 related cases – since reaching elimination status in 2000. But an ongoing outbreak along the border between Arizona and Utah is already the third large outbreak this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00063b6nj94nfg7j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been more than 90 confirmed cases related to the outbreak – at least 59 in Arizona and 36 in Utah, according to state health departments – and case counts continue to grow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00073b6n46rmcqik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist in Utah, said there is still a lot of opportunity for measles to continue to spread in the area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00083b6ncg2sv3sz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, I think we still have quite a while to go with infections. We know that most of our infections have been localized down towards the southern end of our state, but I think we are starting to see now people get infected even at the very north end of our state,” she said. “So I do think that this is going to continue to bop around and spread in different communities. I suspect we’re in the middle of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00093b6n10jfaug5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say that any amount of measles spread is cause for concern, and large outbreaks highlight the dangers of declining vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000a3b6nlu1h1mqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you have multiple cases happening, particularly with those numbers, it’s only possible because you have susceptible individuals,” said Dr. Scott Harris, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000b3b6n688f1ofb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are measles cases in the US every year, often introduced via international travel, Harris said. But those cases can really multiply only if they’re happening among other people who are unvaccinated – and can multiply at large scale only if large parts of a community are unvaccinated. The Texas outbreak is evidence of this, he said, with state health department &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; showing that 97% of its cases were among people who had not gotten one or both of the recommended two vaccine doses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000c3b6njfq9do4u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The story here is: Parents of young children are skeptical about vaccination,” Harris said. “There are lots of reasons why, but if that weren’t the case, this wouldn’t be a story, because we wouldn’t have these outbreaks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000d3b6nqo077tda@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A record share of US kindergartners had an exemption for a required vaccination in the last school year, and coverage for all reported vaccines – including the measles vaccine – continued on a downward trend, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk0lj6q00073b6qkahyoz2b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coverage with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine dropped to 92.5%, the latest data shows. Because measles is such a highly contagious disease, public health experts say that at least 95% MMR coverage is needed to prevent spread. Last year marks the fifth year in a row that coverage has been below that target.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgkqhkbe00003b6niazx1wvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Utah, Nolen says that public health officials have a good grasp on where measles is spreading thanks to wastewater monitoring that can capture virus levels beyond official case counts, and where the risk is elevated due to low vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgkqowk600063b6n86q7r31d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In those areas, we try to work with the local health department and the community to get the word out that we know that there is measles in their area and that we really encourage families to consider getting vaccines,” she said. Misinformation has created some vaccine hesitancy, she said, but vaccination rates have ticked up as awareness about the current outbreak has grown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000e3b6nfk2w2ta5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A separate ongoing outbreak in South Carolina also threatens to grow quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000f3b6nfvnzppuo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 150 unvaccinated children are in quarantine after measles exposures at two schools in the northern part of the state, one public elementary school and one public charter school in Spartanburg County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000g3b6n9gi39iyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those schools are following the protocols to exclude these students until the period of potential disease transmission has safely ended,” Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist, said Thursday. “Those students are identified as having been exposed and not having been vaccinated, and that’s the reason for the exclusion.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000h3b6n7tgrk0ld@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 90% of people who have been exposed to measles and do not have immune protection from vaccination could get infected, Bell said, and “worst-case scenario” would be that rate of infection among the at-risk students who are being closely monitored for symptoms while in quarantine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000i3b6nm2ilcov6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been 11 confirmed measles cases in South Carolina this year, including seven associated with the Spartanburg County outbreak since September 25, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdph.sc.gov%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Finfectious-diseases%2Fviruses-parasites-bacterial-infections%2Fmeasles-rubeola%2F2025&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeidre.McPhillips%40cnn.com%7Ccf54477b5bb445823b7108de076c3305%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638956358682558291%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=SKMKDLZxmtHJsEinaRbgQpFMfnUegLGeorSRI9Uvpgk%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;according to the state health department&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000j3b6nt177sdu0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spartanburg County has one of the lowest school vaccination rates in the state, according to &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdph.sc.gov%2Fhealth-wellness%2Fchild-teen-health%2Fschool-vaccination-coverage-data%2Fschool-vaccination-coverage-and&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeidre.McPhillips%40cnn.com%7Ccf54477b5bb445823b7108de076c3305%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638956358682582140%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=qgZ8%2FHacZhsiUkvcIbGmx2FOA4QM%2FSkkgllcqI%2B7dlw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department. Last school year, less than 90% of school students there received their required immunizations, which includes two doses of the MMR vaccine. School vaccination coverage has been falling in Spartanburg County for years, as it has across the state and nationwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000k3b6nuyecv3fk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A measles case reported Thursday in Greenville County, South Carolina’s most populous county, is being investigated for a possible link to the Spartanburg outbreak. But the state health department is not aware of any other potentially related cases in other states or jurisdictions, Bell said Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000l3b6nb43ydux3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s “incredibly expensive and demanding” for local health departments to respond to measles threats, said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The organization has worked with health departments from across the country to help them learn from their experiences responding to measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000m3b6n8jblw2io@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Health departments are already stretched thin by budget constraints and staff attrition. Adding measles outbreaks to their workload is draining the reserves of even the best-resourced departments,” Rivers said. “It’s been hard to understand from the outside what supports the federal government is offering to local responders.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000n3b6n0l3t04qp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC has continued to update its measles tracker during the federal government shutdown, even as other surveillance data systems have come to a halt. And local health leaders say they have continued to stay in contact with CDC experts, although they have been warned that response times may be a bit slower.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000o3b6nf75iv9yj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Due to a lapse in federal funding, CDC has developed an orderly shutdown plan, ensuring critical public health and safety functions continue without interruption. As found in the plan, CDC and [the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry] would collect data being reported by states, hospitals, and others, and report out critical information needed for state and local health authorities and providers to track, prevent and treat diseases,” according to a statement from the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000p3b6nzvf2h6s5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But federal surveillance systems are far from perfect, and experts say that formally reported measles cases in the US are probably a significant undercount, with some estimating that this year’s total could be closer to 5,000 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000q3b6ndkruzg2t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Current measles outbreak trends are “consistent with an undervaccinated population,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has exacerbated problems with both disease surveillance and vaccination rates, he said, by cutting federal health agency workers and failing to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment"&gt;fully endorse&lt;/a&gt; the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000r3b6nvloqs722@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re in the midst of a measles epidemic,” Offit said. “We should have an administration that stands up clearly and definitively and holds press conferences saying, ‘Vaccinate your children. These are preventable illnesses.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk0uubm00003b6qhkfvzpga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000t3b6njojkbq7c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trust in federal health leadership has suffered under Kennedy, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/rfk-approval-cdc-trust-vaccines-kff"&gt;a new poll shows&lt;/a&gt;, with most US adults saying they disapprove of the way he’s handled vaccine policy and his role as health secretary overall.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I was diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9357-crohns-disease" target="_blank"&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 after over a year of significant pain and major GI problems. I was hospitalized more than once during this year and was referred to a GI doctor in my area. He gave me several reasons for the immense pain I was in: First was that my seat belt probably flung back and hit me, causing a bruise (I didn’t have any bruising). When I told him it was not just pain but that I was also physically sick after eating, he said, 'Well, eat less pizza and drink less beer, and you'll be fine.' It was almost every meal, but sure."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"He referred me for an endoscopy, told me that nothing was wrong, and that sometimes people just have abdominal pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many months of trying to be taken seriously, I switched doctors. With only one test, the new doctor diagnosed me with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease and began a treatment plan that had me in remission within a year. I still manage my Crohn’s with the treatment plan he started a decade ago. When I left that area, I wish I could’ve brought him with me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That first doctor, though, fully dismissed my pain as the naive ranting of a 'girl' in her 20s. I’ve never felt so belittled by someone who was supposed to be a caregiver."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous, 38, Buffalo, NY&lt;/p&gt;

It can be so hard to get your head around the fact that biological pregnancy is not going to work. But as someone going through IVF myself, let me say: the LW has not been paying attention to the details if she thinks having sex with Manny one time is going to solve her problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32k002n3b6imtpfpy0k@published"&gt;Did the doctor definitively say that the reason conception has failed is her husband’s sperm? Does she know with certainty that she has numerous viable eggs that can fertilize unassisted? Does she know that her ovulation cycle is predictable and healthy?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32l002o3b6iavnh5p9c@published"&gt;The LW was likely told that the probability of natural pregnancy per menstrual cycle is around&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11585-conception"&gt; 25 percent&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s if she’s in her 20s and there are no other health impediments for her or her husband. This probability&lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/having-a-baby-after-age-35-how-aging-affects-fertility-and-pregnancy"&gt; drops precipitously&lt;/a&gt; with age.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32l002p3b6iio2t5ufx@published"&gt;This is not to discourage people who are &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/09/rapamycin-fertility-ovarian-reserve-menopause-antiaging-skepticism.html"&gt;trying to conceive&lt;/a&gt;—I’m in that precipitously dropping probability group, and &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/08/fertility-cliff-advanced-maternal-age-outdated.html"&gt;thank goodness for modern medicine&lt;/a&gt;! But it is noticeable to me that she has gone through IVF and not had a successful pregnancy, so she has been educated on the small probabilities we’re dealing with, and the likelihood that even with the best medicine has to offer, it’s not going to happen. And she and her husband are still thinking there might be a good reason to try this plan, which has seemingly &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/01/mychart-patient-portal-fertility-journey-pregnancy-anxiety.html"&gt;infinite ways&lt;/a&gt; it can go wrong … and only one minuscule way it can go right?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32l002q3b6idqprkep7@published"&gt;That either means there’s more going on here—as you suggested, maybe she or her husband is looking for an excuse for her to have sex with Manny. In that case, DO NOT get a child involved. But more worrying to me is the likelihood that she, her husband, or both have not really understood and processed the IVF failure. There is almost no reason to think she will get pregnant naturally from sleeping with Manny once. The fact that she or her husband think it’s that easy, despite everything they have already learned and experienced, means they need to spend time working through the disappointment and grief that come with accepting that biological children are not in their future. The effort to process, grieve, heal, and move forward as a family should be the focus—not cockamamie schemes that may only damage the marriage more and simply delay the pain of infertility.&lt;/p&gt;

And you make a good point about the fact that they’ve already tried IVF. Sperm quality is definitely something they check out during that process, so the couple should really know definitively, beyond “it looks as though the doctors [who predicted that he wouldn’t be able to conceive when he was a child] were correct.” We have updated information! Anyway, I don’t want to get too far into the medical details, even though those of us who’ve been throughIVF should really have some kind of honorary degree in fertility medicine. Suffice it to say, the answer to “Could this really be the solution we’ve been looking for?” is “probably not.”&lt;/p&gt;

I wonder if seeking out a chosen family might help fill this void. Perhaps you could start with fellow adoptees. There’s a lot of discussion about adopted children who went through exactly what you’ve experienced and I bet you would vibe with some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

No detail is too small. Take your time—spend a week or more on it. When you can’t think of one more thing, go through the list and pick out the 10 or 12 most important items. Again, take your time and consider carefully. Once you have locked that down, order the list. Put the most important first, and write them out from first to last. Read it often. If you go out to a bar, read the list before you go. If you go on a weekend singles adventure, make it your purpose to open your heart and get to know everyone.

But perhaps you could also remind the LW that her mother is a fully formed adult who still has desires and needs. No one wants to think of their parents as sexual beings (eww), but the LW seemed to give her dad a pass for his behavior while sort of condemning her mom for her new boobs. There is nothing wrong with wanting to feel attractive at any age, and it’s not necessarily a sign of dementia. The LW should give some grace to her mom—and stay out of it with her sisters.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s making me more and more annoyed as time goes on and I notice it more. Of course, I also worry that she will direct that at me and I don’t need that in my life.

While topical minoxidil is an approved therapy, its limited ability to dissolve in water and penetrate the skin reduces its effectiveness. Researchers reporting in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/em&gt; have found that stevioside, a natural sweetener extracted from the Stevia plant, can help improve how well the drug is absorbed through the skin.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;&lt;p data-start="510" data-end="730"&gt;In tests using a mouse model of alopecia, a dissolvable patch containing both stevioside and minoxidil successfully stimulated hair follicles to re-enter the growth phase, which resulted in the development of new hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using stevioside to enhance minoxidil delivery represents a promising step toward more effective and natural treatments for hair loss, potentially benefiting millions worldwide," said co-corresponding author Lifeng Kang, PhD, of the University of Sydney, in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Androgenetic alopecia develops gradually over time and is influenced by both genetic and hormonal factors. The condition occurs when hair follicles become increasingly sensitive to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone derived from testosterone. This sensitivity causes the follicles to shrink, leading to shorter and finer strands of hair until growth eventually stops. Although the pattern and progression differ between men and women, the biological mechanism is similar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Currently, treatment options are limited, with minoxidil being one of the few widely approved topical therapies. Minoxidil works by widening blood vessels and increasing blood flow around hair follicles, which can extend the growth phase of the hair cycle and stimulate new strands to develop. However, because the drug does not easily pass through the outer layer of skin and dissolves poorly in water, its full potential is often not realized. Patients must apply it consistently for several months before seeing results, and even then, the response varies from person to person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This challenge has driven researchers to explore new ways of improving how minoxidil is delivered to the scalp. Enhancing the drug’s skin permeability could make treatments more efficient, reduce application frequency, and possibly lower side effects related to overuse. The discovery that stevioside can act as a natural absorption enhancer offers a new direction for scientists seeking to improve both the safety and effectiveness of hair loss therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

Your hair keeps growing just fine, but the color fades thanks to the cells in the hair follicles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That switch doesn’t happen because your whole body suddenly “gets old.” It starts inside each follicle, where pigment stem cells are supposed to leave their safe zone, catch a cue, and become the color-making melanocytes that dye each new strand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When those cells, known as melanocyte stem cells (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193459091000651X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McSCs&lt;/a&gt;) stop moving on schedule, the color step gets skipped – even though the hair still grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study adds to our basic understanding of how melanocyte stem cells work to color hair,” said study lead investigator Qi Sun, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NYU Langone Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The newfound mechanisms raise the possibility that the same fixed positioning of melanocyte stem cells may exist in humans. If so, it presents a potential pathway for reversing or preventing the graying of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-natural-cure-male-baldness-highly-effective-sugar-2-deoxy-d-ribose/"&gt;human hair&lt;/a&gt; by helping jammed cells to move again between developing hair follicle compartments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-follicle-cells-and-gray-hair"&gt;Follicle cells and gray hair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside a follicle, two neighborhoods matter most for color. The hair germ sends out strong chemical messages that tell pigment stem cells to mature into melanocytes. The bulge is a safer hangout with no “make color now” message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a healthy cycle, stem cells travel from the bulge into the hair germ right as a new hair begins. Next, they hear the signals from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/wnt-protein" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WNT proteins&lt;/a&gt;, then shift into McSCs, and load pigment into the growing shaft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later on, some of the cells that produce gray hairs will reset to a stem-like state for the next round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers watched this in action rather than guessing from snapshots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using long-term live imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing across multiple growth cycles in mouse follicles, they tracked where individual cells were and what instructions they were reading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When regrowth was repeatedly forced, more pigment &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blood-stem-cells-grown-in-the-lab-for-first-time-ever-leukemia-treatment/"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; lingered in the bulge, missed the WNT-rich zone, matured less often, and gray hairs increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The location of the gray hair follicle cells led to a signal, the signal led to a decision, and that decision led to the hair’s color – or to gray when that chain broke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-location-movement-and-timing"&gt;Location, movement, and timing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That process completely reframes how we think about follicle cells and graying hair. Time matters, but not like a countdown clock that drains color. Movement and timing matter more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigment stem cells have to make the trip at the right moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is the loss of chameleon-like function in melanocyte stem cells that may be responsible for graying and loss of hair color,” said study senior investigator &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/mayumi-ito-suzuki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mayumi Ito, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/dermatology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/cell-biology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Department of Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt; at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lose that chameleon behavior – arriving in the right neighborhood when the cue is loud – and you can still grow healthy hair shafts that emerge silver because the dye step never happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations-on-gray-hair-cell-study"&gt;Limitations on gray hair cell study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists are careful to point out that there were limitations to what could be proven in this study. Stress isn’t a single switch that turns hair gray for good, and simply flipping stem cells “on” won’t fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gray hair follicle cells can be present and still fail if they never reach the signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any future approach would need to help them move on time or make the hair germ more inviting, not just blast the whole follicle with a random growth command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might ask how this maps to people, since the experiments used mice. Human follicles share the same architecture and cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this fact, two separate paths make sense to explore in greater detail: restore the commute so pigment stem cells reach the hair germ right when a new hair starts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, tune the local cues so that, once there, cells clearly hear the message to become McSCs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing and restraint would be critical. Push too many cells to mature at once and you could drain the reserve; push too few and nothing changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fixing-gray-hair-cells-in-the-real-world"&gt;Fixing gray hair cells in the real world&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal isn’t a permanent “color” switch – it’s to keep the rhythm going so some cells color the hair now while others reset for later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this fits a simple idea: cells read their surroundings before they act. DNA provides options; the neighborhood tells them which option to pick today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In gray hair follicles, neighborhoods shift across time and space. When pigment &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stem-cells-can-shift-from-hair-growth-to-skin-healing/"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; reach the right spot at the right moment, they catch the message, become melanocytes, and color the strand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When movement or timing fail, the message is lost and the hair grows in gray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no treatment yet – this is just a map, not a medicine. However, scientists do believe they’re getting very close to a real-world solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-for-scientists"&gt;Next steps for scientists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future studies in people confirm the same pattern, scientists can test gentle ways to ease the traffic – nudging cells out of the bulge or strengthening the hair germ’s signals – without derailing the rest of the system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to protect flexibility. They must mature enough cells to color the hair you’re growing now, and keep enough in reserve so the system still works years from now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the next time you spot a gray strand, remember that your hair didn’t forget how to grow. The factory is fine; it’s the commute inside the follicle that jammed. Fix the traffic and, in theory, color could return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, gray doesn’t have to mean weak or unhealthy hair. It can mean the pigment team missed its cue – and that turns gray from a mystery into a timing problem science is learning how to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05960-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 01:42:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQTmRaUy1qS2RHTjZjbTRQNl9yRko0TU9MOEhVNldKS1ZOekhINjZfdkswUzBLdVVlZWg2empDSi1IUF9HLXRvQXN3aERVVFZORkR2bHoya1d2NWdfajJHYXZWN05HNDFHZnlhZWs3OGxoZGtMYTVMNEo5RzRLY0JlelRqM3NwaW03UjFidjlKN3BtQmJISWFPWmFvbDAzbFBjaXVTN1ltN0Y</guid></item><item><title>专家说，治疗关节疼痛的最佳药物不是你想的那样- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/the-best-medicine-for-joint-pain-isnt-what-you-think-expert-says</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Stiff knees, aching hips and the slow grind of chronic joint pain are often accepted as an unavoidable part of getting older. But while osteoarthritis is the world's most common joint disease, experts say the way we treat and prevent it is badly out of step with the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best medicine isn't found in a pill bottle or an operating theatre – it's movement. Yet across countries and health systems, too few patients are being guided toward the one therapy proven to protect their joints and ease their pain: &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/exercise-670"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is one of the most effective treatments for chronic, disabling joint conditions &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-are-the-key-risk-factors-for-developing-knee-osteoarthritis-we-reviewed-the-evidence-253722"&gt;such as osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. Yet very few patients actually receive it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/do-your-knees-click-heres-what-it-means-and-when-to-see-a-doctor"&gt;Do Your Knees 'Click'? Here's What It Means, And When to See a Doctor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research across health systems in &lt;a href="http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11227783/"&gt;Ireland, the UK, Norway&lt;/a&gt; and the United States shows the same pattern: fewer than half of people with osteoarthritis are referred to exercise or physiotherapy by their primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 60 percent are given treatments that guidelines do not recommend, and around 40 percent are sent to a surgeon before &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/do-you-have-knee-pain-from-osteoarthritis-you-might-not-need-surgery-heres-what-to-try-instead-236779"&gt;non-surgical options&lt;/a&gt; have even been tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why those figures are so troubling, it helps to understand what exercise does for joints. Osteoarthritis is by far the most common form of arthritis, already affecting more than 595 million people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00163-7/fulltext"&gt;global study in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, that number could approach one billion by 2050. Longer life expectancy, increasingly sedentary lifestyles and rising numbers of overweight or obese people are driving the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet people who exercise regularly are physically and biologically protecting themselves from developing the disease and from suffering its worst effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cartilage that covers the ends of our bones is a tough, protective layer with no blood supply of its own. It relies on movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a sponge, cartilage is compressed when we walk or load a joint, squeezing fluid out and then drawing fresh nutrients back in. Each step allows nutrients and natural lubricants to circulate and maintain joint health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why the old idea of osteoarthritis as simple "wear and tear" is misleading. Joints are not car tires that inevitably grind down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis is better understood as a long process of wear and repair in which regular movement and exercise are critical to healing and to the health of the entire joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177108" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/WomenHoldingOntoHandLikeItsInPain-e1760056845637.jpg" alt="women holding onto her other hand like she's in pain" class="wp-image-177108 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177108" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Osteoarthritis impacts the whole joint region. (SimpleImages/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A disease of the whole joint&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now know osteoarthritis is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3295952/"&gt;whole-joint disease&lt;/a&gt;. It affects the joint fluid, the underlying bone, the ligaments, the surrounding muscles and even the nerves that support movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic exercise targets all these elements. Muscle weakness, for instance, is one of the earliest signs of osteoarthritis and can be improved with resistance training. There is strong &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889857X12001299?via%3Dihub"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that muscle weakness increases the risk of both developing the disease and seeing it progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nerve and muscle control can also be trained through &lt;a href="https://www.jospt.org/doi/full/10.2519/jospt.2025.13041"&gt;neuromuscular exercise&lt;/a&gt; programs &lt;a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-017-1439-y"&gt;such as GLA:D®&lt;/a&gt; (Good Life with osteoArthritis: Denmark) for hip and knee osteoarthritis. Usually delivered in supervised group sessions by physiotherapists, these programs focus on movement quality, balance and strength to improve joint stability and rebuild confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant improvements in pain, joint function and quality of life &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1063458421000339"&gt;have been recorded&lt;/a&gt; for up to 12 months after completing the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is good medicine for the whole body: it has documented benefits across more than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26606383/"&gt;26 chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;. In osteoarthritis, it helps not only by strengthening cartilage and muscle but also by tackling the inflammation, metabolic changes and hormonal shifts that drive the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2596954/"&gt;major risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for osteoarthritis, and not merely because of the extra mechanical load on joints. High levels of inflammatory molecules in the blood and in joint tissues can degrade cartilage and accelerate disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For osteoarthritis, regular activity can counter this at a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9110817/#S1"&gt;molecular level&lt;/a&gt;, lowering inflammatory markers, limiting cell damage and even altering gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise first, surgery later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently there are no drugs that modify the course of osteoarthritis. Joint replacement surgery can be life-changing for some people, but it is major surgery and does not succeed for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise should be tried first and continued throughout every stage of the disease. It carries far fewer side effects and brings many additional health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osteoarthritis is not simply a matter of "worn out" joints. It is shaped by muscle strength, inflammation, metabolism and lifestyle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular, targeted exercise addresses many of these factors at once – helping to protect cartilage, strengthen the whole joint and improve overall health. Before considering surgery, movement itself remains one of the most powerful treatments we have.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260638/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

They tracked 54 women aged 18 to 40 not using hormone-based contraception and grouped them according to how much exercise they took: inactive (reported not taking part in any form of structured exercise), recreationally active (taking part in at least two hours of structured exercise a week), competing in any sport at club level, and elite (competing in any sport at national or international level).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They then completed cognitive tests and reported their mood and symptoms on the first day of menstruation, two days after the end of menstruation (late follicular phase), the first day ovulation was detected, and between ovulation and menstruation (mid-luteal phase).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study, published in Sports Medicine – Open, found that women perform best on cognitive tests when they ovulate, with on average participants reacting about 30 milliseconds faster compared with later in their cycle and making fewer mistakes. But for elite athletes, the difference in performance was much more pronounced. On average, their attention and inhibition scores were more than 120 milliseconds faster, and their simple reaction time was 80 milliseconds faster at ovulation than the luteal phase of their cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Flaminia Ronca, the lead author of the study from UCL Surgery and Interventional Science and the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, said: “At an elite level, 80 milliseconds slower reaction times makes a big difference and in a fast-paced sport like rugby, it could put you at greater risk of concussion or serious musculoskeletal injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the other end of the exercise spectrum, the authors also found that compared with active participants (at whatever level), inactive participants had reaction times on average about 70 milliseconds slower and made about three times as many impulsive errors, regardless of cycle phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This difference could determine whether we regain balance after tripping over an obstacle or not, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This shows the importance of incorporating some form of recreational physical activity into our lives,” Ronca said. “It doesn’t have to be that intense or competitive to make a difference – and crucially, it’s something that we can control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Responding to the findings, Stephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/women" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Women&lt;/a&gt; in Sport said: “While it is fascinating to understand the tiny cognitive supercharging that happens the day of ovulation, the most interesting conclusion is around the cognitive benefits of being active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Having the time to register and respond to a risk is the difference between having a fall or righting yourself. For women in wiser life, avoiding falls is especially vital given the huge gendered health inequality around osteoporosis with one in two women over 50 suffering from this, compared to one in nine men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We already knew being active can build bone strength and now we know being active can increase our response times. This report adds a second layer of urgency to get women active and address the tragedy and cost of fragility fractures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxORVdKS09Xem83V0lES2x6X0pZNTdMWktNaEtacFpUT1FmZ21HM2NMRF9idXUtQ2ZRbUJSUkZocnRUSXpqWWZMWHNJN3pBcXhMV2t0bVd3WHdFa2tCbWY5TWFKZ3VCdzVOZUpKaEtXUlRaTGRIWUV3ZGh1bVgxOVg4UGNGMURTbWJZWFQ0SXB5SXJObmpUVVhvcmRoM2Q2Q1VhS1RqdzRn</guid></item><item><title>大自然的狂野：户外的四大健康益处- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg0yvdjgn5o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 jRDKjj"&gt;How 20 minutes of nature can boost your health&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kSquvq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dfa1/live/aaf4fca0-a387-11f0-a56f-0b1b78ebdf89.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A wide, front view angle shot of a family and their dog walking through a woodland forest in Northumberland, Northeastern England during the Covid-19 pandemic." class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Spending just 20 minutes in nature can trigger measurable changes inside your body&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;If you've ever felt calmer after a walk in the park or a stroll through the woods, it's not your imagination - it's biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Being outdoors can trigger measurable changes inside your body from lowering stress hormones, easing blood pressure and even improving your gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;You don't have to hike for hours to feel these benefits as maximum impact happens after just 20 minutes, so even a lunchtime walk to the park and a sandwich on a bench a few times a week can benefit your body and mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Here are four ways that being among nature can help improve your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;1.

Your hormones reboot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Your body's hormonal system also joins in the relaxation act. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Willis says that spending time outdoors lowers levels of cortisol and adrenaline - the hormones that surge when you're stressed or anxious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"A study found that people in a hotel room for three days who were breathing in Hinoki (Japanese cypress) oil saw a big drop in the adrenaline hormone and a big increase in natural killer cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Natural killer cells are cells that tackle viruses in the body. The participants in the study still had elevated natural killer cells in their body two weeks after inhaling the smell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Essentially nature "calms what needs calming and strengthens what needs strengthening," is how Prof Ming Kuo from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000vy1l" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;summed it up to the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"A three-day weekend in nature has a huge impact on our virus fighting apparatus and even a month later it can be 24% above baseline." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Studies also show smaller but still persistent effects from shorter periods spent in nature, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;3.

A recent report from the British Heart Foundation found that coronary heart disease, which occurs when the arteries become narrowed, is the leading cause of premature death, responsible for killing around 66,000 people each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 22:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOTERna2dLNGtaaXFXc3JOaFN5Q1VHa2hGcFFZZTBaQjN6QURJM1BmbDNHMnBvRVFDZGt5aUVZdXVzaGlpa1ZTSUxqZEo5bXZtLTA1VllnOGVmeUI4RlNFTmE0M2NIdHlCbUJtSXdmUVhvX1RRLTFwekx3RTJsOWVZXzdmZXlpS2YtX1hpS19uVWhFZzlyRUxMTFZEbmVKT21tZ09Lcg</guid></item><item><title>由于疾病预防控制中心取消咨询会议，儿童疫苗可以安全接种一段时间- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/childhood-vaccines-safe-for-a-little-longer-as-cdc-cancels-advisory-meeting/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;An October meeting of a key federal vaccine advisory committee has been canceled without explanation, sparing the evidence-based childhood vaccination schedule from more erosion—at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was planning to meet on &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251003112109/cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html"&gt;October 22 and 23&lt;/a&gt;, which would have been the committee's fourth meeting this year. But the meeting schedule was updated in the past week to remove those dates and replace them with "2025 meeting, TBD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars Technica contacted the Department of Health and Human Services to ask why the meeting was canceled. HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard offered no explanation, only saying that the "official meeting dates and agenda items will be posted on the website once finalized."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACIP is tasked with publicly reviewing and evaluating the wealth of safety and efficacy data on vaccines and then offering evidence-based recommendations for their use. Once the committee's recommendations are adopted by the CDC, they set national vaccination standards for children and establish which shots federal programs and private insurance companies are required to fully cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the committee has been stacked with highly esteemed, thoroughly vetted medical experts, who diligently conducted their somewhat esoteric work on immunization policy with little fanfare. That changed when ardent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. became health secretary. In June, Kennedy abruptly and unilaterally fired all 17 ACIP members, falsely accusing them of being riddled with conflicts of interest. He then installed his own hand-selected members. With the exception of one advisor—pediatrician and veteran ACIP member Cody Meissner—the members are poorly qualified, have gone through little vetting, and embrace the same anti-vaccine and dangerous fringe ideas as Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corrupted committee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, Kennedy's advisors have met twice, producing chaotic meetings during which members revealed a clear lack of understanding of the data at hand and the process of setting vaccine recommendations, all while setting policy decisions long sought by anti-vaccine activists. The first meeting, in June, included seven members selected by Kennedy. In that meeting, the committee rescinded the recommendation for &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/rfk-jr-s-cdc-panel-ditches-some-flu-shots-based-on-anti-vaccine-junk-data/"&gt;flu vaccines containing a preservative called thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; based on false claims from anti-vaccine groups that it causes autism. The panel also ominously said it would re-evaluate the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/06/all-childhood-vaccines-in-question-after-first-meeting-of-rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel/"&gt;entire childhood vaccination schedule&lt;/a&gt;, putting life-saving shots at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We're constantly told to "eat healthy" – but what does that actually mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even doctors sometimes struggle to offer clear, practical advice on which specific foods support health, why they work and what real benefits people can expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research is starting to offer some answers. Along with colleagues, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40126033/"&gt;I have researched&lt;/a&gt; whether a group of plant compounds called flavan-3-ols could help lower blood pressure and improve blood vessel function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/new-study-finds-tea-and-chocolate-may-help-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;The results suggest&lt;/a&gt; these everyday compounds may have real potential for protecting heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-better-sleep-could-be-as-simple-as-eating-more-fruit-and-veggies?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;The Secret to Better Sleep Could Be As Simple As Eating More Fruit And Veggies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavan-3-ols – sometimes called flavanols or catechins – are natural plant compounds that belong to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5465813/"&gt;flavonoid family&lt;/a&gt;. They're part of what gives plants their colour and helps protect them from sunlight and pests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us, they show up in some of our most familiar foods: cocoa, green and black tea, grapes, apples and even some berries. That slightly tart or bitter note you taste in dark chocolate or strong tea? That's flavan-3-ols at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long been interested in their health effects. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294962/"&gt;In 2022, the Cosmos trial&lt;/a&gt; (Cocoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study), which followed over 21,000 people, found that cocoa flavanols, but not multivitamin supplements, reduced deaths from cardiovascular disease by 27%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study set out to dig even deeper, focusing specifically on their effects on blood pressure and endothelial function (how well blood vessels dilate and respond to blood flow).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analysed data from 145 randomised controlled trials involving more than 5,200 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies tested a range of flavan-3-ol-rich foods and supplements, including cocoa, tea, grapes, apples and isolated compounds like epicatechin, and measured their effects on two key cardiovascular markers: blood pressure and flow-mediated dilation (FMD): a measure of how well the inner lining of blood vessels functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies ranged from short-term (a single dose) to longer-term interventions lasting weeks or months. On average, participants consumed about 586 mg of flavan-3-ols daily; roughly the amount found in two to three cups of tea, one to two servings of dark chocolate, two tablespoons of cocoa powder, or a couple of apples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular consumption of flavan-3-ols led to an average drop in office blood pressure of 2.8 mmHg systolic (the top number) and 2.0 mmHg diastolic (the bottom number).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for people who started with elevated blood pressure or diagnosed hypertension, the benefits were even greater with reductions of up to 6–7 mmHg systolic and 4 mmHg diastolic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's comparable to the effects of some prescription blood pressure medications and could significantly lower the risk of heart attacks &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/eight-ways-to-reduce-your-stroke-risk-no-matter-what-age-you-are-251524"&gt;and strokes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that flavan-3-ols improved endothelial function, with an average 1.7% increase in FMD after sustained intake. This benefit appeared even in participants whose blood pressure was already normal, suggesting these compounds may help protect blood vessels through multiple pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects were uncommon and typically mild, usually limited to minor digestive issues, suggesting that adding flavan-3-ol-rich foods to your diet is generally safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Supporting cardiovascular health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the benefits were most pronounced in those with high blood pressure, even people with normal readings saw improvements in vascular function. This suggests flavan-3-ols may help prevent cardiovascular problems before they begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure is one of the major drivers of heart disease worldwide, even at levels that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10243231/"&gt;don't qualify as full-blown hypertension&lt;/a&gt; (140/90 mmHg or higher). &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072696#:%7E:text=The%202024%20European%20Society%20of,treat%20depends%20on%20the%20underlying"&gt;Recent guidelines&lt;/a&gt; from the European Society of Cardiology now recognise that even "elevated" blood pressure (120–139 systolic and 70–89 diastolic) carries increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes, particularly diet and exercise, are recommended by doctors as first-line strategies. But patients and even healthcare providers often lack clear, specific guidance on which foods truly make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings help fill this gap by showing that boosting flavan-3-ol intake through everyday foods may offer a simple, evidence-based way to support cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167409" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate.png" alt="Tea in a cup next to berries and chocolate" class="size-full wp-image-167409" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate-415x415.png 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167409" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating certain foods could help support your heart health. &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/elegant-tea-setting-with-strawberries-and-chocolates-31583807/"&gt;İclâl Ağlamaz/Pexels&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies tested supplements or isolated flavan-3-ol compounds, but these generally showed smaller effects than whole foods like tea or cocoa. This may be because other beneficial compounds in whole foods work together, enhancing absorption and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, it appears both safer and more effective to focus on getting flavan-3-ols from foods rather than high-dose supplements, especially for people taking medications, since interactions are not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies we reviewed suggest that 500–600 mg of flavan-3-ols daily may be enough to see benefits. You could reach this by combining two to three cups of green or black tea, one to two servings (about 56g) of dark chocolate or two to three tablespoons of cocoa powder, two to three apples, plus other flavan-3-ol-rich fruits like grapes, pears and berries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small daily swaps, then, like trading a sugary snack for an apple and a piece of dark chocolate or adding an extra cup of tea, could gradually improve your heart health over time. Because flavan-3-ol content can vary between foods, monitoring your blood pressure at home may help you see if it's making a difference for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed, particularly in people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="177076" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, where the results were less consistent. We also need to better understand how flavan-3-ols interact with medications and whether even greater benefits can be achieved when combined with other healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the evidence is now strong enough to recommend flavan-3-ol-rich foods as part of a heart-healthy diet. As clinicians seek practical, affordable lifestyle strategies for patients, these findings bring us closer to the idea of using food as medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, flavan-3-ols aren't a magic fix. They won't replace medication for everyone. But combined with other healthy habits, they may offer a meaningful – and delicious – boost to cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And unlike many health fads, this isn't about exotic superfoods or expensive powders. It's about foods many of us already enjoy, used a little more intentionally.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256631/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

            He revived his usual lie that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 election he legitimately lost to Joe Biden. And he declared once more that the big domestic policy bill he signed earlier this year includes “no tax on Social Security,” though that’s not what the bill says.

In fact, babies do not receive anywhere close to 82 vaccines in &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt;, as the &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fhcp%2Fimz-schedules%2Fchild-adolescent-age.html&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDaniel.Dale%40cnn.com%7C1cf371ce9f6a45c7049a08de0761317e%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638956311208945787%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=HvuJ2UjEaqDoWL5QZOGXofX4dIAZWng0eDPOXyH3NCI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommended childhood vaccination schedule&lt;/a&gt; shows; US babies generally get well under 20 different vaccines (and roughly 20 to 30 shots) by the age of 15 months.

            &lt;strong&gt;The size of vaccine doses&lt;/strong&gt;: Trump, referring to a glass of water on the table in front of him, speculated that autism could possibly be linked to “these massive vaccines that are twice the size of a jar like that, a glass of water like that - into a baby’s body.” The notion of a link between vaccines and autism has been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/autism.html" target="_blank"&gt;debunked&lt;/a&gt;, and no vaccine given to babies is even close to the size of a glass of water, let alone two glasses. The MMR vaccine, to cite a &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/catg.d/p3085.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;typical example&lt;/a&gt;, has a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/administering-mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;dosage of 0.5 milliliters&lt;/a&gt;, roughly a tenth of a teaspoon.

            &lt;strong&gt;The Amish, vaccines and autism&lt;/strong&gt;: Trump, referring to the Amish community in Pennsylvania, said “they don’t take any of this stuff and they have virtually none, right, they have no autism.” It wasn’t clear whether he was referring to vaccines specifically or both vaccines and modern medications when he said “don’t take any of this stuff,” but the claim is false regardless; &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medschool.umaryland.edu%2Fprofiles%2Fmitchell-braxton%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDaniel.Dale%40cnn.com%7C1cf371ce9f6a45c7049a08de0761317e%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638956311208964439%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=P18PICi1jjeHx1xRTjjVlQMas1JUlJ%2BeNzHnb057uIY%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Braxton Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who has worked with Amish communities for more than 30 years and is co-director of the Amish Research Clinic in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said it’s not true that the Amish categorically reject vaccines and pills, and &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimfar.confex.com%2Fimfar%2F2010%2Fwebprogram%2FPaper7336.html&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDaniel.Dale%40cnn.com%7C1cf371ce9f6a45c7049a08de0761317e%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638956311208981603%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=djYzaREOGZkZfsKovZsl08gvsTYex4fJypC%2BvjEFQNE%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not true&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that they have no autism at all.

            “Regarding vaccines: some Amish choose to vaccinate their kids and some do not. So it is incorrect to say that Amish do not vaccinate,” Mitchell told CNN when Trump made similar claims in late September.  “A claim was also made about use of Tylenol. I can tell you that Tylenol is used by many Lancaster Amish.”

Mitchell noted it’s not clear what the prevalence of autism is in Amish communities, since there has been “very little systematic data” collected on the subject, but: “Bottom line: yes, autism does exist in the Amish. We do not know how its frequency compares to non-Amish.”

&lt;p&gt;"Change matters: Improvements in heart health can decrease future risk, and the earlier it is attained and maintained, the better, " senior researcher &lt;a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/profile/donald-lloyd-jones/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

These include metals such as iron, zinc, manganese, cobalt and copper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For most of these trace elements, decades of research have shown they are genuinely essential for health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron is essential for carrying oxygen in your blood, and many proteins – complex molecules that carry out all of the functions necessary for life – require iron to function properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A deficiency of iron leads to anemia, a condition that results in fatigue, weakness, headaches and brittle nails, among other symptoms. Iron supplements can help reverse these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A panel of experts had previously recommended adults get about 30 micrograms per day of chromium in their diet (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Importantly, biochemists have pinpointed exactly how iron helps proteins perform essential chemical reactions, not just for humans but all living organisms. Researchers know not only that iron is essential but also why it is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the same cannot be said for chromium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chromium deficiency – having little to no chromium in your body – is extremely rare, and researchers have not identified any clearly defined disease caused by low chromium levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like all food, essential metals must be absorbed by your digestive system. However, the gut absorbs only about 1 percent of ingested chromium. Other essential metals are absorbed more efficiently – for example, the average person absorbs around 25 percent of certain forms of ingested iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite many studies, scientists have yet to find any protein that requires chromium to carry out its biological function. Only one protein is known to bind to chromium, and this protein most likely helps your kidneys remove the metal from your blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some studies in people suggest chromium might be involved to some degree in regulating blood glucose levels, research on whether adding extra chromium to your body through supplements can substantially improve your body's ability to break down and use sugar has been inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thus, based on biochemistry, there is currently no evidence that humans, or other animals, actually require chromium for any particular function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The idea that chromium might be essential for health stems from studies in the 1950s, a time when nutritionists knew very little about what trace metals are required to maintain good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One influential study involved feeding lab rats a diet that induced symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Supplementing their diet with chromium seemed to cure the rats of Type 2 diabetes, and medical researchers were enticed by the suggestion that chromium might provide a treatment for this disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today's widespread claims that chromium is important for regulating blood sugar can be traced to these experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unfortunately, these early experiments were very flawed by today's standards. They lacked the statistical analyses needed to show that their results were not due to random chance. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, they lacked important controls, including measuring how much chromium was in the rats' diet to start with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Later studies that were more rigorously designed provided ambiguous results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some found that rats fed chromium supplements controlled their blood sugar slightly better than rats raised on a chromium-free diet, others found no significant differences. But what was clear was that rats raised on diets that excluded chromium were perfectly healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experiments on people are much harder to control for than experiments on rats, and there are few well-designed clinical trials investigating the effects of chromium on patients with diabetes. Just as with the rat studies, the results are ambiguous. If there is an effect, it is very small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, there has been a recommended dietary intake for chromium despite its lack of documented health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The idea that chromium is needed for health persists due in large part to a 2001 report from the National Institute of Medicine's Panel on Micronutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This panel of nutritional researchers and clinicians was formed to evaluate available research on human nutrition and set 'adequate intake' levels of vitamins and minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their recommendations form the basis of the recommended daily intake labels found on food and vitamin packaging and the NIH guidelines for clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite acknowledging the lack of research demonstrating clear-cut health benefits for chromium, the panel still recommended adults get about 30 micrograms per day of chromium in their diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This recommendation was not based on science but rather on previous estimates of how much chromium adult Americans already ingest each day.

The lead compound, K102, not only promotes remyelination but also balances immune function—key for long-term neurological recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animal and cell studies, it restored myelin-producing cells and showed strong potential for translation to human therapies. Now being developed by Cadenza Bio, this discovery could lead to the first therapy that helps regenerate, not just protect, nerve fibers in MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restoring Myelin:&lt;/strong&gt; K102 and K110 both promote myelin repair, with K102 emerging as the strongest candidate for treating MS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Action:&lt;/strong&gt; K102 restores damaged axons while also modulating immune function, a balance crucial for MS management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward Clinical Trials:&lt;/strong&gt; The compounds are now moving toward human testing as part of a biotech-led translational program.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting more than 2.9 million people worldwide. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath, the protective insulation around nerve fibers, causing disruption of nerve signals between the brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can include numbness, tingling, vision loss, and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While current treatments can reduce inflammation, no therapies yet exist to protect neurons or restore the damaged myelin sheath. Researchers have now taken a major step forward in the development of such a therapy, supported by funding from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. They have identified two compounds that could remyelinate damaged axons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, the research, led by Seema Tiwari-Woodruff, a professor of biomedical sciences at the University of California, Riverside, School of Medicine, and John Katzenellenbogen, a professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, or UIUC, was made possible through two National MS Society funding programs: a traditional investigator-initiated grant and the Society’s Fast Forward commercial accelerator program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work represents more than a decade of collaboration, with the last four years focused on identifying and optimizing new drug candidates that show strong potential to treat MS and possibly other neurological diseases involving demyelination,” Tiwari-Woodruff said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the funding, the researchers were able to launch a program that was licensed by Cadenza Bio, Inc. With subsequent investor financing, Cadenza Bio has supported continued development of the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is now advancing toward clinical evaluation as a potential first-in-class therapy for people living with MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From discovery to development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project builds on earlier research involving a compound called indazole chloride, known for promoting remyelination and modulating the immune system in mouse models of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While effective, indazole chloride lacked the pharmacological properties and patentability needed for clinical development and commercial investment, Tiwari-Woodruff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with UIUC chemists Katzenellenbogen and Sung Hoon Kim, who synthesized the compounds, Tiwari-Woodruff’s research group, led by recent UCR graduate Micah Feri, screened more than 60 indazole chloride analogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collaboration identified two lead candidates, K102 and K110, which exhibited improved safety, efficacy, and drug-like properties in both mouse models and human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the two, K102 emerged as the lead compound. The researchers found it not only promotes remyelination but also modulates immune function, an important balance for MS therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also showed promising results in human oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, suggesting the potential for translatability between the animal models and human disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under normal conditions, oligodendrocyte precursor cells mature into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes to repair damaged myelin. In MS, however, this natural repair process often fails, leading to permanent nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful remyelination through a compound like K102 could restore faster nerve conduction and may help reduce long-term disability associated with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“K110 is also a strong candidate,” Tiwari-Woodruff said. “It has slightly different central nervous system effects and may be better suited for other conditions like spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury, so we’re keeping it in the pipeline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From bench to biotech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiwari-Woodruff and Katzenellenbogen credit the National MS Society’s Fast Forward program as a turning point. Fast Forward accelerates the commercialization of promising therapies by promoting academic-industry partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highly competitive grant enabled Tiwari-Woodruff and Katzenellenbogen to generate sufficient data to license the rights to Cadenza Bio to develop K102 and K110.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patents are jointly held by UCR and UIUC, with an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement in place between the universities and Cadenza Bio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This project has been a good example of how long-standing academic collaborations can lead to real-world applications,” Katzenellenbogen said. “Our shared goal was always to take a promising idea and develop it into a therapy that could help people with MS. We’re finally getting close to that reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, UCR’s Office of Technology Partnerships collaborated with UIUC to seek patent protection. Grace Yee, assistant director of technology commercialization at UCR, said the joint efforts of UCR, UIUC, and the National MS Society advocated for and promoted the technology to investors and industry for commercial development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our entrepreneurs-in-residence also helped advise the project, so the team was able to develop materials and messaging to highlight the project’s commercial value,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When investors expressed interest in the technology, UCR and UIUC helped them understand how the technology addresses an unmet need in treating MS. These efforts led to the licensing agreement with Cadenza Bio.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elaine Hamm, chief operating officer at Cadenza Bio, said she and Carol Curtis, cofounder of Cadenza Bio, were impressed by the possibility of moving from slowing axon damage to repairing axon damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the future we want to build,” Hamm said. “It is why we licensed the technology, and why we are excited to move it forward to patients in need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than a decade in the making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiwari-Woodruff and Katzenellenbogen have worked together for more than 12 years. Tiwari-Woodruff’s move from UCLA to UCR in 2014, she said, turned out to be a pivotal decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The support from UCR — from leadership to infrastructure — has been extraordinary,” Tiwari-Woodruff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of this would’ve been possible without that backing. Funding for academic labs like mine and John’s is crucial. This is selfless work, driven by a deep love of science and commitment to human health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the initial focus is MS, the team believes K102 and K110 could eventually be applied to other diseases involving neuronal damage, including stroke and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cadenza Bio is now advancing K102 through the necessary non-clinical studies required to support first-in-human clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re hopeful that clinical trials can begin soon,” said Tiwari-Woodruff. “It’s been a long journey — but this is what translational science is all about: turning discovery into real-world impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was also supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health and Cadenza Bio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiwari-Woodruff, Katzenellenbogen, Kim, and Feri were joined in the research by Flavio D. Cardenas, Alyssa M. Anderson, Brandon T. Poole, Devang Deshpande, Shane Desfor, Kelley C. Atkinson, Stephanie R. Peterson, Moyinoluwa T. Ajayi, Fernando Beltran, Julio Tapia, and Martin I.

ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR: You showed courage and you’ve shown leadership and I can’t thank you enough for letting me do this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So, think of that one in 20,000, and now it’s one in 12 for boys, one in 18, 19 for girls. So obviously, there’s something that’s artificially, I think, induced, something, whether it’s the vaccines in terms of these massive vaccines that are twice the size of a jar like that, of a glass of water like that into a baby’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And I’ve… suggested, get them in doses, get him in, you know, maybe 20 percent, 30 percent, but smaller, not such a big. I think, you know, that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And we had certain recommendations, the MMR, take them separately. The measles is already separate now and it works out much better, but there doesn’t seem to be any impact if you take it separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you take as a combination, it’s not so great. And some other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But I would say don’t take Tylenol. If you’re pregnant, and when you’re — when the baby is born, don’t give it Tylenol. You can avoid it at all, just don’t give it to Tylenol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Really, what do you have to lose? You really don’t have much to lose. Here, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;SEC. ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR: There’s also just, there’s many, many other confirmation studies. There’s two studies that show children who are circumcised early have double the rate of autism. It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol. So none of this is dispositive, but all of it is stuff that we should be paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But, you know, there’s a tremendous amount of proof or evidence, I would say, as a non-doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But I’ve studied this a long time ago. You know, I met Bobby in my office 20 years ago. We were talking about the same thing 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And I was a real estate developer, but it bothered me that it seemed to be getting worse. But it’s so bad now when you hear these numbers. It’s not even really sustainable. I don’t know how people do it, but…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is some very strong evidence on Tylenol. In fact, at one point, I guess the company gave a warning. They gave the…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;SEC. ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR: They still don’t recommend it during pregnancy. That’s the weird thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They’re not recommending it, and that’s the company itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, just don’t take it. Don’t take if you’re a woman, don’t take it and don’t give it to the baby when the baby’s born. And I think that’s going to have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But I’d also get the shots in smaller doses. There are a few things we give, a few things that just seem to be. And I’d think you’d get that number way back up. Think of it. You have One in 20,000 and now it’s just it’s not it’s not even believable when you when you think the 20, 000 drops to 12? 12 12 children?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So that’s that’s induced by something that’s given or taken and it should be able to be stopped and you’re talking about the Pennsylvania Dutch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You were talking about the Amish, where… They don’t take any of this stuff, and they have virtually none, right? They have no autism, no autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So we’re doing something very bad. Somebody’s been given some bad things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other countries, by the way, we have, I think, one — we have 82 vaccines that we give simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And I’m a vaccine believer, by way. I believe in the polio vaccine. I believe a lot of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But when you give 82 vaccines in a shot to a little baby that hasn’t even formed yet, it’s a lot of vaccines. And in Japan, they give a much smaller number. In Germany, they gave a much more, like, 28 vaccines. That’s a lots too. But 28 is a lot different than 82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So but I would say on the Tylenol, don’t take it. And And that will be — I think it’s going to be a big factor. I think — I’ll think it’ll be a very good result. And I hope we’re going to able to see that result and then not too distant future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because certainly, people have heard us loud and clear. This is why I bring it up again. That’s why I asked you to talk about it, because this is a horrible thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And if you don’t take it — I mean, you have to tough it through sometimes. There are other things you can do, but you have tough it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s easy for me to say. But I think you’re gonna see numbers that will be so it’ll be so significantly improved and maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Maybe fully improved. I mean this there’s something there. There’s something going on and we have to address it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And so I’m addressing it the best I can as a non-doctor, but I’m a man of common sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 18:37:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxORlBrTlQ2OWZNckNCbzllcklvRXUyeGdnRk9HcTU4NlZJT3FEX2VfUTBTLUtreHgxMnJKcmxqMl9HUlBobWVkYjRCTTByeHAzWmJrbW9fQW9ublF3T0ZNM2xyaU1YYXV6T2hLWk1wb3ZvdFF2cW9lZW9mOWdQQWpKYWNnczhQeUQyZFFFRVJtSQ</guid></item><item><title>ER Docs希望人们停止在车内做这件超常见的事情- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/er-docs-want-people-stop-145000250.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency room doctors see firsthand how everyday actions can turn life-threatening real quick. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/emergency-department.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, there are 155.4 million emergency room visits in the US every year. &lt;a href="https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb286-ED-Frequent-Conditions-2018.jsp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Some of the most common reasons people visit the ER;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Some of the most common reasons people visit the ER&lt;/a&gt; are because of respiratory symptoms, stomach pains or gastrointestinal issues, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1037762/kimberlyzapata/mental-health-quotes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mental health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;-related concerns and pregnancy or childbirth-related issues. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But do you know what tops all of these reasons for an ER visit?

There’s one such habit that ER doctors we talked to say makes them cringe when they see people doing it because it’s so dangerous, even life-threatening. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;🩺&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for Parade’s health newsletter with expert-approved tips, healthy eats, exercises, news &amp;amp; more to help you stay healthy &amp;amp; feel your best self;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for Parade’s health newsletter with expert-approved tips, healthy eats, exercises, news &amp;amp; more to help you stay healthy &amp;amp; feel your best self&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;💊&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Common Habit ER Doctors Are Begging People To Stop Doing In the Car&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re a passenger, you get to settle into your seat without a worry in the world (as long as you trust the person driving, of course). You can relax, listen to music, look out the window and enjoy the ride. But getting too comfortable can be dangerous. ER doctors we talked to say that one common habit they wish everyone would avoid in the car is putting their feet on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do a lot of driving on Los Angeles freeways, and one of the things that makes me cringe is when I pass a passenger who has their feet up on the dashboard,” says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/solomon-m-behar" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Solomon Behar, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Solomon Behar, MD,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a pediatric emergency medicine physicianatMiller Children’s &amp;amp; Women’s Hospital and MemorialCare Long Beach Medical Center in Long Beach, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/kids-activity-to-never-do-according-to-er-doctor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:'I'm an ER Doctor—Here's the One Activity I Would Never, Ever Let My Kids Do';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;'I'm an ER Doctor—Here's the One Activity I Would Never, Ever Let My Kids Do'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Behar explains that putting your feet on the dashboard of the car is dangerous because if there’s a collision, the force of the airbag and the forward momentum of the passenger can force the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1029887/ericasweeney/sudden-knee-pain/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:knees;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;knees&lt;/a&gt; and legs into the dashboard, and you can get really severe, life-threatening injuries such as fractures, dislocations and ligamentous injuries to the pelvis, knees and the hips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pediatrix.com/find-care/doctors/snow-jacob-1730321100" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jacob Snow, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Jacob Snow, MD, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;a pediatric emergency room specialist at Pediatrix Medical Group in Las Vegas, Nevada, also warns against putting your feet on the dashboard in the car. “There is always some risk of being involved in a car accident every time you ride or drive. Riding with your feet on the dash adds unnecessary risk,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Snow points out that if the car you’re in comes to a rapid stop, either from an accident or simply from slamming the brakes to avoid a crash, a passenger can experience significant leg injury if their feet are up on the dashboard. “Your body will move forward with the momentum of the car and that can lead to fractures of the leg bones or dislocated joints,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-never-do-after-taking-a-fall" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:'I'm an ER Doctor—This Is the One Thing You Should Never, Ever Do After a Fall';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;'I'm an ER Doctor—This Is the One Thing You Should Never, Ever Do After a Fall'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of an accident, Dr. Snow reveals that airbags may deploy at a very rapid rate, inflating in a fraction of a second. “These airbags are intended to protect the passenger; however, if your legs are on the dashboard, the force of the airbag can severely injure the legs or push your legs back into your face,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And some injuries, like a fracture or dislocated hip, can cause lasting damage to the hip joint. “If a child sustains a serious hip injury or fracture and damages the growth plate, it can lead to early arthritis and potentially end with the child needing a hip replacement early in adulthood,” Dr. Snow adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/when-to-go-to-er-with-stomach-pain" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:If Your Stomach Pain Feels Like This, Go To the ER;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;If Your Stomach Pain Feels Like This, Go To the ER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips for Avoiding Injuries While Riding in the Car&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both doctors say that the safest way to sit in the car is with your knees bent and feet on the floor, with your seatbelt on. “[Sitting this way is safest because] it allows the seat belt and airbag systems to function as they were supposed to, distributing the forces more evenly and actually reducing the risk of drying your legs and pelvis,” Dr. Behar says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Snow agrees. “Cars are designed to protect passengers seated with their feet on the floor. It prevents the risk of your legs buckling or being pushed back into your face by the dash itself or the airbags. Additionally, many cars have special airbags designed to protect your legs,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides riding in the car with your feet on the dashboard, Dr. Behar explains that it’s also not a good idea to cross your legs, excessively recline the seat, or lie on your side, sharing, “All of those positions can increase the risk of pelvic, spine or head injuries by changing how your body moves in a crash, and reducing the effectiveness of the seat belts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for keeping kids safe in the car, Dr. Snow says that children should always be in a car seat or a booster seat as recommended for their age and weight. “Once a child graduates from their booster, they should stay in the back seat until they are at least 13 years of age,” he stresses. And of course, any passenger in a car, whether child or adult, should always use a properly fitted and positioned seatbelt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you aren’t the one driving in the car, it’s still important to prioritize safety during your ride. That way, you can reach your destination safely—without a detour to the ER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/worst-habit-for-heart-health-over-50-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: This Is the #1 Worst Habit for Heart Health if You’re 50 and Older, According to Cardiologists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: This Is the #1 Worst Habit for Heart Health if You’re 50 and Older, According to Cardiologists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/solomon-m-behar" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Solomon Behar, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Solomon Behar, MD,&lt;/a&gt; pediatric emergency medicine physicianatMiller Children’s &amp;amp; Women’s Hospital and MemorialCare Long Beach Medical Center in Long Beach, California&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pediatrix.com/find-care/doctors/snow-jacob-1730321100" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jacob Snow, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Jacob Snow, MD, &lt;/a&gt;pediatric emergency room specialist at Pediatrix Medical Group in Las Vegas, Nevada&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-to-stop-doing-in-the-car-according-to-er-doctors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Oct 9, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health &amp;amp; Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Health &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt; section.

They pointed to the at least 12 states which have brought back similar COVID-era restrictions during the 2024-2025 respiratory virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the pandemic, these requirements have become common, especially ahead of winter to try and prevent co-occurring outbreaks of the flu, COVID, RSV and norovirus - a combination season doctors have dubbed the 'quad-demic.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Todd Ellerin, an infectious diseases specialist at Harvard University, told the Daily Mail: 'There are many [health care] systems, including around Boston, where when certain metrics are hit - like when the rate of influenza-like illnesses exceeds a certain threshold - then the systems will have the providers within hospitals wear masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Mask mandates will not be unique to California. When you are working in places where there are vulnerable patients, it makes sense to consider mask mandates.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But not everyone thinks it will be as strict everywhere as it is in some counties. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bill Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, told the Daily Mail: 'I would not think we would see widespread face mask mandates. [But] there might be recommendations or encouragements to wear masks...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is such an aversion, generally, across the country to mandates, I would not think there would be very many of those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both experts said it is likely that face masks will return in areas experiencing viral outbreaks that strain hospital systems, adding that residents will probably be urged to wear the coverings in an attempt to drive down cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many pro-maskers argue that face masks help prevent infections by catching virus-laden droplets expelled when people sneeze, cough or talk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11702865/Masks-make-little-no-difference-Covid-infections-massive-cross-country-meta-analysis-finds.html"&gt; major review &lt;/a&gt;by the Cochrane Collaboration - which has been called the 'gold standard' for evidence-based investigations by Alberto Merchante-González, chief of public health for the Spanish Ministry of Health - found that cloth coverings and surgical masks made 'little to no difference' to COVID infection or death rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts have warned that many coverings contain holes that are too large to catch droplets, saying people should instead opt for the medical-grade N95 masks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others have raised concerns that failing to wash reusable masks regularly can turn them into a breeding ground for bacteria, increasing the risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of today, at least six counties in California's Bay Area -&lt;span&gt; Contra Costa, Santa Clara, Sonoma, Napa, San Mateo and Santa Cruz - have reimposed mask mandates in some health care settings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts told the Daily Mail it was likely that face masks would return in areas experiencing viral outbreaks that strain hospital systems (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Starting November 1, each will require health workers and, in some cases, visitors or patients, to wear face coverings in medical settings used by frail, ailing or vulnerable patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karen Smith, Sonoma County's interim health officer, told the Daily Mail: 'The risk to vulnerable patients of COVID, flu and other respiratory viruses in health care remains significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, it continues to be important for face masks to be used in patient care areas when the seasonal risk of exposure to one or more viruses is high.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mandate in Sonoma County has been set to be renewed every year unless it is repealed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are scant reports of other counties considering face mask mandates at present, although experts say this may shift as cooler weather approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;COVID cases have recently dropped in California, CDC wastewater data suggests, falling from 'high' to 'moderate' levels statewide. Both flu and RSV levels are also very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the state does have a higher COVID hospitalization rate than the national average - 4.4 per every 100,000 people were hospitalized with the disease in the week of September 6 - compared to 2.6 per every 100,000 nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During last year's flu season, from October 2024 to May 2025, officials saw COVID-era restrictions return in 12 states, although these were focused on certain settings and were not statewide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, face mask restrictions returned in some health care settings. In &lt;span&gt;Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota and North Carolina, some officials brought back both mask mandates and visitor restrictions for health care facilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Officials in Michigan and South Carolina only brought back visitor restrictions to hospitals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;From 2024 to early 2025, the US experienced a worse respiratory virus season than average, with the CDC classing the season as 'high severity' and the most severe since the 2017-2018 season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, an estimated 47 million people were sick, while 610,000 were hospitalized and 26,000 died from the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tyler Evans, former chief medical officer for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-2f25c290-a453-11f0-8029-1778f75a41bc" class=""&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, told the Daily Mail: 'Broad mandates may not be necessary right now, but we shouldn't shy away from common-sense measures in higher-risk settings, like hospitals, nursing homes and public transit during surges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the most recent COVID levels in wastewater in each state. Wastewater is one way to track the activity of a virus in communities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We know masks work, especially when layered with vaccination. The key is flexibility, clear guidance, and empowering people to make informed choices based on local trends.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, wastewater surveillance suggests COVID levels dropped from 'high' to 'moderate' over the week of September 20. But they were 'very high' in four states: Connecticut, Delaware, Nevada and Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both flu and RSV levels remain 'very low' across the US, although experts say this could be because the nation is at the early stages of the winter virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Norovirus outbreaks also remain low. Only one outbreak of the stomach virus was recorded nationwide in August, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts said levels are likely low because it is still early in the season, and warned cases could soon rise as colder weather forces more people indoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are also&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15159343/Map-new-covid-strain-spread-xfg-usa.html"&gt; concerns over a new COVID variant&lt;/a&gt;, named XFG or 'Stratus,' that has become the dominant strain in the US since first arriving in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials say it is not more likely to cause severe disease than previous strains, but is more transmissible than previous variants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 17:32:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxOaW9CWVVzTnR0MTVwNmZxd0lhZDNONnFMZ0xJdXlvaGNReFUtNnBfX0xnVDlEMkx4bHNIWGd4LW40NXgzeTRKRHVuMVV5aFI1UmJ0ajlwUUhKdzBpd1J4VnpXZnZlMFQ1NlN1WTRTNHN2WVJrc0V2MFZfTk1NWEFxTGZvM3Y0NUxNZF9faQ</guid></item><item><title>降低心脏病发作和癌症风险的新“超级食物” ……只需$ 2 -每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15177451/superfood-prevent-heart-attacks-colon-cancer.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's been a staple in Asian cuisine for thousands of years, but now, kimchi is getting global attention for being the 'next superfood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kimchi is made from fermented cabbage and radish and flavored with spices. While once only common in Korean foods, the sour vegetable dish is now mixed into hundreds of meals and paired with foods like eggs, rice, avocado and even ice cream.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, researchers in the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/connecticut/index.html" id="mol-677f8bf0-a50f-11f0-a8c8-5720553c9d68"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;'s College of Agriculture, Health and Natural Resources (CAHNR) have found that consuming kimchi is associated with improved levels of blood sugar, triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood stream, and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maintaining healthy blood sugar levels is important for warding off &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-1ca13780-a511-11f0-a8c8-5720553c9d68"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and keeping triglyceride levels low is important for preventing heart attacks, strokes and pancreatitis, inflammation of the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, maintaining a healthy blood pressure can also help prevent heart attacks and strokes, as well as heart disease, the world's number one killer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kimchi also provides gut and digestive health benefits due to its fermentation process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fermented foods are full of probiotics, beneficial bacteria that feed the body's natural collection of bacteria, called the microbiome. This collection of bacteria promotes healthy digestion, and, researchers are increasingly positing that an unbalanced microbiome &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13784061/marathon-runner-pancreas-cancer-deadly-symptoms-ignored-harmless.html"&gt;could raise the risk of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kimchi is readily available for a fraction of the price of 'designer' probiotics. The dish is commonly found in refrigerated sections of grocery stores and servings of it cost as little as $2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kimchi is made from fermented cabbage and radish and flavored with spices (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neuroradiologist and longevity expert Dr Kavin Mistry told Daily Mail the preliminary data is 'promising.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Given how central gut health is to systemic inflammation, immune regulation, and metabolic function, I see kimchi as a potentially valuable component of a dietary pattern that supports heart health and reduces cancer risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review from the researchers in Connecticut included nine studies comprising of nearly 43,000 people carried out between 2011 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to people who did not eat fermented kimchi, those who did had a fasting glucose level of 1.93 mg/dL. It is not known what the participants' levels were before the experiment, but lower glucose levels are crucial to reduce the risk of diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, 38 million Americans have either diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes, and the prevalence is rising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is associated with 95,000 deaths annually.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Triglyceride levels decreased by nearly 29 mg/dL. Similarly, baseline levels were not reported, but lower levels are associated with a decreased risk in heart complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High triglycerides are associated with heart disease, heart attacks, strokes and artery disease. High levels are associated with a 25 percent greater likelihood of a heart disease-related death when above 200 mg/dL, according to the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthy levels are below 100 mg/dL.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kimchi provides gut and digestive health benefits due to its fermentation process (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, hypertension, or high blood pressure, was improved. There was a decrease in both blood pressure parameters: 3.48 mm/Hg in systolic and 2.68 mmHg in diastolic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ock Chun, co-author and professor of nutritional sciences, said: 'That’s a really good number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In clinical settings, even a reduction of 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure is considered a meaningful improvement. So, seeing comparable reductions from a dietary intervention, not medication, is a very promising result.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hypertension has a significant effect on overall health, especially heart health. Chronic high blood pressure can cause heart disease and heart failure. It can weaken the heart muscle, damage arteries, impair blood flow and increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure afflicts nearly 50 percent of Americans, 122 million people, according to the American Heart Association and CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And heart disease accounts for one in three deaths in the US each year, about 919,000 in 2023 - the latest data available. It is the leading cause of death nationwide, as well as around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Daniel Atkinson, a general practitioner and clinical lead at telehealth company Treated, told Daily Mail kimchi can be part of a healthy lifestyle that helps prevent a slew of conditions, including obesity, diabetes, cancer and widespread inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Its health benefits are great news for anyone looking to improve their heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Diseases like hypertension and diabetes, as well as an increased risk of colon cancer, often share similar risk factors involving obesity and inflammation. So as well as trying to increase activity levels, doctors will always suggest you look at ways you can improve your health through your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And improving the diversity of your gut microbiome is a great place to start... so eating kimchi fits perfectly with [this].'  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kimchi is full of probiotics thanks to its fermentation process, and probiotics contribute to a healthy microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A preliminary investigation in 2020 by scientists in South Korea found that fermented kimchi intake led to 'significant changes' in people's fecal microbiome and the food showed 'significant' prevention in the development of colitic cancer and the formation of adenomas in the intestines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adenomas are benign tumors but their growth increases the risk of future cancerous tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers involved in a 2022 study on the microbiome and colon cancer said: 'Under normal conditions, the gut microbiome acts as a barrier to other pathogens or infections in the intestine and modulates inflammation by affecting the host immune system.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The collection of bacteria in the gut play a role in modulating the body's anti-cancer immune response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded: 'Various animal and clinical experiments have demonstrated that changes in the composition of the gut microbiota affect the initiation of precancerous cancer lesions and cancer progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because the colorectal region is a site where changes in the gut microbiota can influence the organs directly, [colon cancer] is considered to be affected by the gut microbiome more than other tumors.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This collection of bacteria promotes healthy digestion, and, researchers are increasingly positing that an unbalanced microbiome &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13784061/marathon-runner-pancreas-cancer-deadly-symptoms-ignored-harmless.html"&gt;could raise the risk of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kimchi is made from fermented cabbage and radish and flavored with spices (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kimchi is readily available for a fraction of the price of 'designer' probiotics. The dish is commonly found in refrigerated sections of grocery stores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neuroradiologist and longevity expert Dr Kavin Mistry told the Daily Mail the preliminary data is 'promising.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Given how central gut health is to systemic inflammation, immune regulation, and metabolic function, I see kimchi as a potentially valuable component of a dietary pattern that supports heart health and reduces cancer risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review from the researchers in Connecticut included nine studies comprising of nearly 43,000 people carried out between 2011 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to people who did not eat fermented kimchi, those who did had a fasting glucose level of 1.93 mg/dL.

In a study published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt; on 8 October&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, scientists in the United Kingdom say they have found a way to distinguish epigenetic changes in the cells of people who have the condition, which is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.16905" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.16905" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A debilitating long-term illness, ME/CFS affects between 17 and 24 million people worldwide&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but these numbers are crude estimates because clinicians have long lacked reliable diagnostic tools for this poorly understood condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study show that the epigenetic test could be developed into a clinical biomarker for ME/CFS, said Dmitry Pshezhetskiy, a researcher–clinician at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, and lead author of the study, in a press release that was published alongside the paper. “With no definitive tests, many patients have gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.” He added that the discovery “offers the potential for a simple, accurate blood test to help confirm a diagnosis, which could lead to earlier support and more effective management”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others in the field have cautiously welcomed the findings, but they point out that the study was small and that more work is needed to convert the technique into a clinical tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-08965-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03299-8/d41586-025-03299-8_16164570.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;A reboot for chronic fatigue syndrome research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Epigenetic markers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underlying &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-08965-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-08965-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;mechanisms of ME/CFS remain unclear&lt;/a&gt;, but evidence is building that one of the hallmarks of ME/CFS is immune dysregulation. The authors had already developed an assay that screens for epigenetic changes in immune cells in the blood, which they used to identify epigenetic signatures for a range of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The assay analyses the way DNA is folded inside peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a key part of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested whether the same assay could be used to screen for similar epigenetic changes to immune cells in the blood of 47 individuals with severe ME/CFS, comparing the results with those from 61 healthy participants. The data showed that the assay achieved a 96% accuracy in diagnosing people with ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors found a network of genomic changes that were strongly involved in immune and inflammatory signalling. The authors say that this is consistent with an immune-dysregulation signal in ME/CFS, and underscores the strength of using these changes as biomarkers of the condition. And they say the changes they identified can be connected to specific regions of non-coding DNA, which can help to unpick the role of genetics in the condition and lead to a better mechanistic understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s really cool they brought this method to the field,” says Katie Glass, a molecular biologist who studies ME/CFS at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “As far as it being a biomarker, my enthusiasm would be pretty tempered because the cohort is very small and they looked at only very severe patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/news/biological-underpinnings-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-begin-to-emerge-1.21721" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03299-8/d41586-025-03299-8_15338418.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Biological underpinnings of chronic fatigue syndrome begin to emerge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many studies using various techniques to analyse everything from metabolites to free floating RNA in the blood have identified several apparent signatures of ME/CFS, adds Glass, who previously had the condition but has now recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Uncertainty over federal &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/vaccines/"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; policy had caused a temporary patchwork of access across the country, with shots being offered in some places and not others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This week, the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/cdc/"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; issued &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/cdc-immunization-schedule-individual-decision-covid19-standalone-chickenpox-toddlers.html"&gt;new guidance&lt;/a&gt; around the use of &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/covid-19/"&gt;Covid&lt;/a&gt; vaccines, dropping a broad recommendation for vaccination and instead leaving the choice up to individuals. While it marks a change in official CDC policy, the guidance allows shots to be rolled out to pharmacies, and for states to once again offer them to people of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Prior to this fall, the CDC universally recommended the Covid vaccine for anyone 6 months or older. The agency’s new guidance, drafted by a panel of experts handpicked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., says that individuals should consult with a health care provider before getting the shot, what the agency calls “individual-based decision-making.” The CDC’s definition of providers includes physicians, nurses, and pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Informed consent is back,” said Jim O’Neill, acting CDC director and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) deputy secretary, in an &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/cdc-immunization-schedule-individual-decision-covid19-standalone-chickenpox-toddlers.html"&gt;October 6 statement&lt;/a&gt;. “CDC’s 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual Covid-19 boosters deterred healthcare providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, first moved to restrict Covid vaccines in May, when &lt;a data-offer-url="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138"}' href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;he announced&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC would no longer recommend them to healthy children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Confusion mounted in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated Covid vaccines but only for adults ages 65 and older and younger people with medical conditions that put them at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html"&gt;higher risk of severe disease&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, Covid shots were indicated for anyone 6 months and older. Because of differing state laws that determine the scope of practice for pharmacists, the change triggered pharmacies in some states to require a prescription, while in others pharmacies stopped offering the shots entirely. Several states, however, took swift action to restore access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 14:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQb1loZkJGdU0yd0ZHWFdVcnRqbndkXzFnR1JJa2Y3bkxkS2NCYmNnbEFld2J6MWpudTc4ZlJMTV9KYnRFTElvX3hNODd5RXdrcmcyLVZqQVI2MnU2a0E2dUVTaEdqWGs3M0d0cXFBWTVkLWZPYWNBdXpkbDVRTks4SWlqWjZZMlFoMlFVdFV6X2ctbWVTUE1r</guid></item><item><title>不安腿综合征与帕金森病的关系- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-restless-leg-syndrome-parkinson-disease.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three research hospitals in the Republic of Korea are reporting that restless leg syndrome was associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, with 1.6% of patients with restless leg syndrome developing Parkinson's disease vs. 1.0% in matched controls and a shorter average time to diagnosis at a 15-year horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Restless leg syndrome causes unpleasant sensations in the lower limbs, with symptoms worsening during rest and eased by movement. While pathophysiology remains unclear, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical care&lt;/a&gt; often uses &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dopamine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt; agonists as first-line therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in movement control. Dopamine agonists mimic the effects of dopamine by activating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dopamine+receptors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dopamine receptors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease patients experience reduced dopamine and use dopamine agonists as the primary treatment to help improve movement control. Previous studies have examined links between the two disorders and questioned whether &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/restless+leg+syndrome/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;restless leg syndrome&lt;/a&gt; could be triggered by the same dopaminergic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Risk of Parkinson Disease Among Patients With Restless Leg Syndrome," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2839651" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/retrospective+cohort+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retrospective cohort study&lt;/a&gt; to assess whether restless leg syndrome is a risk factor for Parkinson's disease and whether the dopamine pathway is meaningfully associated with both conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Data came from the Korean National Health Insurance Service Sample Cohort spanning 2002 to 2019, a deidentified database representing a 2% stratified random sample of the Korean population. Final analytic groups comprised 9,919 patients with restless leg syndrome and 9,919 matched controls. Mean age at enrollment measured about 50 years in both groups, with 62.8% women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine agonist exposure was defined as receipt of pramipexole or ropinirole during two or more distinct clinical visits, forming a dopamine treated subgroup, with remaining patients classified as dopamine nontreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall incidence of Parkinson's disease reached 1.6% in the restless leg syndrome cohort, 60% higher than the 1.0% in matched controls. Subgroup analysis showed that those taking a dopamine agonist had only 0.5% Parkinson's incidence compared to 2.1% in the nontreated group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors conclude that restless leg syndrome may be associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease. Patients with restless leg syndrome who were not treated with dopamine agonists tended to have an elevated risk of Parkinson's and a slightly shorter time to diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study does not imply that early use of dopamine agonists prevents or delays Parkinson's disease, as the design was not powered to determine this, but it could hint at a delay in diagnostic symptoms or a potential neuroprotective effect that could be the subject of future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest a connection between the two conditions that may involve mechanisms beyond the dopaminergic pathway. Clarifying this association and the role of the dopamine pathway may improve understanding of the pathophysiology of both diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Few things in this world are more miserable than food poisoning. You go out to eat some delicious foods, or cook at home. You’re happy, full, and then… everything goes south. Sometimes literally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But hark! This torturous fate may soon be vanquished, thanks to some scientists at the University of Maryland who might just have created a vaccine that protects against Salmonella bacteria, one of the most common sources of foodborne illness and potentially life-threatening infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, the researchers have tested out their vaccine in human volunteers in a Phase I clinical trial. Not only did the vaccine appear to be safe and well-tolerated, it also seemed to create a robust immune response to the target bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings provide a strong foundation for future studies,” study co-author Myron Levine, professor emeritus at UM’s School of Medicine, said in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-vaccine-typhoid-invasive-salmonella-human.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. The results were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04003-z"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Nature Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A pervasive threat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When people get Salmonella, it’s typically caused by a specific species of the bacteria, called &lt;em&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/em&gt;. But there are many subtypes, or serovars, of Salmonella within this species. One notorious subtype (&lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; Typhi) causes typhoid fever—an extreme form of food poisoning that causes a high fever (hence the name), a cough, rash, nausea, weakness, and diarrhea, and which can last as long as a month and require special antibiotics to treat. Other, non-typhoidal subtypes cause more typical food poisoning symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The most common sources of Salmonella are undercooked meat, poultry, eggs, or unwashed fruit and vegetables, as well as through contact with infected people. Typhoid spreads similarly, and through water contaminated with the urine or feces of an infected person.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;More than a million Americans are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/food-safety/php/data-research/foodborne-illness-burden/index.html"&gt;sickened&lt;/a&gt; by Salmonella every year, and tens of thousands are hospitalized as a result. Most Salmonella infections don’t last long—just a few days or a week—but they can sometimes lead to severe, even fatal illness. These severe cases tend to happen when the bacteria spreads beyond the digestive tract and invades other parts of the body. They’re also more likely to occur in children under five, the elderly, or people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s vaccine targets three different subtypes of Salmonella: the bacteria that cause typhoid fever and two other subtypes that are a common source of invasive infections in young children, especially in less developed areas of the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s vaccine is a conjugate vaccine, meaning it combines polysaccharide antigens (sugar molecules, to put it plainly) from the outer coating of these bacteria with a carrier protein that boosts the immune system’s ability to recognize the bacteria. The vaccine is currently code-named the trivalent Salmonella conjugate vaccine, or TSCV.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Early promise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers tested TSCV in a small, controlled trial involving 22 healthy adult volunteers from the U.S. Two groups received varying doses of the vaccine, while the third was given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Phase I trials are primarily meant to vet a drug or vaccine’s safety, and TSCV passed with flying colors. The vaccine was found to be safe, with the most common adverse event being pain at the injection site. Importantly, the researchers also detected a immune response to the three subtypes in all the vaccinated volunteers, including the production of antibodies, suggesting that TSCV works as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Importantly, the findings are based on a small sample size. There is still plenty more work needed to affirm the vaccine’s broader safety and effectiveness. But if it keeps hitting its milestones, then TSCV could be a boon to the world, and especially for the people most vulnerable to severe Salmonella infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These results are highly encouraging,” lead researcher Wilbur Chen, a professor of medicine at UM, said in a statement. “They show that TSCV has the potential to protect children in regions where both typhoid and Salmonella are endemic and deadly.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;TSCV’s potential benefits could extend even beyond that. The subtypes it targets don’t just cause invasive infections, the researchers note, they’re also some of the most common strains of Salmonella that cause food poisoning in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, it is always important to practice good food safety and proper hygiene no matter what (wash your hands and don’t undercook your chicken, people), but it’d be incredible to know that in the future, when you are chowing down, Salmonella could be one less thing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a 49-year-old man visited Dr. Danielle Belardo, a cardiologist, with chest pain. For some time, he had been treating his high cholesterol not with the statin suggested by his doctor, but with berberine and red yeast rice supplements. He had heard they were more natural. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supplements hadn’t managed his condition — far from it. Belardo discovered that he not only still had high cholesterol, but also had elevated liver enzymes and coronary artery disease so severe that he needed open-heart surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She referred him for the procedure and started him on two medications to bring down his cholesterol, including a statin. She also told him to quit the supplements. A few weeks later, the liver issues resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time when Americans are buying and taking record amounts of supplements — well over half of adults consume one — some doctors and dietitians are trying to persuade patients to take it easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At her practice in Pasadena, Calif., Belardo often takes a hard line, regularly “de-prescribing” supplements. Last year, she persuaded one patient to stop taking 132 of them, including some to “detox” the kidneys and liver. Marily Oppezzo, an instructor of medicine at Stanford Prevention Research Center and a registered dietitian, said she channels decluttering powerhouse Marie Kondo by asking patients which ones spark “real, evidence-backed joy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wide variety of gummies, pills and powders are categorized as supplements, including vitamins and minerals, compounds like creatine and herbal products such as ashwagandha and kava. Almost all doctors say a few of them have their place; women benefit from taking folic acid, for example, when trying to have a baby. Some people have vitamin or mineral deficiencies that supplements can help address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But supplements can also come with side effects, which patients are sometimes “shocked” to learn about, said Dr. Mitra Rezvani, a hospitalist at Westchester Medical Center in New York. Many are merely uncomfortable — stomach issues, for example. But some are more serious. One paper in The New England Journal of Medicine estimated that supplements are responsible for 23,000 emergency room visits a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ways doctors broach the issue can vary. Rezvani has had patients list everything they’re taking and explain why, which helps start a discussion about what they should reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Dr. Jen Gunter, an OB-GYN in San Francisco, tries to not push too hard. “The worst thing you can do is make a patient feel like they can’t talk to you,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, when she sees yet another patient taking probiotic supplements, “I’m always like, ‘Well, if those worked, you wouldn’t be coming to see me.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt; Nausea and rashes &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration only lightly regulates supplements, monitoring them less rigorously than drugs and not approving them for safety or effectiveness before they reach the public. Supplements have been found to be mislabeled, in terms of both the ingredients and their concentration. And some mix poorly with certain medications or with one another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of what some have called “the wild west” nature of the market, it can be difficult to predict adverse side effects. Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who studies supplements, had one 45-year-old patient who developed rashes on her legs and back after starting on an anti-migraine supplement. Cohen suggested she stop taking the supplement, and the rashes went away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunter worries about Ayurvedic supplements, some of which have been found to include lead, arsenic and mercury. Other doctors watch out for signs of supplement-related liver damage. Last year, researchers at the University of Michigan estimated that 15 million American adults take a supplement that could potentially cause liver toxicity, such as turmeric or red yeast rice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rezvani once treated a 70-year-old woman who had been experiencing nausea, jaundice and dark urine after starting a turmeric supplement, as well as semaglutide, the compound in the medication Ozempic. Rezvani and her team determined the supplement had likely damaged the liver and possibly interacted with the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient stopped taking the supplement. Soon after, her liver function improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Overlooking underlying issues &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belardo said she understands why her patients turn to supplements. Prominent doctors sell and promote them online. The pharmaceutical and health care industries have left many Americans disillusioned. And some patients feel dismissed at the doctor, leading them to seek out alternative treatments for their pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, people may take a supplement to manage an unwanted symptom, instead of undergoing medical testing that would reveal the root cause of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, a 44-year-old woman came to Belardo for an evaluation. During the visit, the patient noted that, on a naturopath’s recommendation, she had been taking an iron supplement to treat anemia and fatigue, but she still felt tired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iron supplement itself didn’t concern Belardo. What did was that the naturopath had not probed the underlying problem. In hopes of figuring it out, Belardo sent the patient to a gastroenterologist, who performed a colonoscopy. The diagnosis: stage IV colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an extreme version of a type of situation that frustrates her most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Months, if not years, of opportunity for earlier detection and treatment had been lost,” Belardo said, “because her care was reduced to supplement prescriptions.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Lifestyle modification remains “a cornerstone” of MASLD management. Current guidelines advise against SSBs, but the evidence regarding LNSSBs remains “limited,” Liu explained in her presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the researchers analyzed data of 123,788 UK Biobank participants without liver disease at baseline who were followed for an average of 10.3 years. Beverage consumption was assessed through repeated 24-hour dietary questionnaires using the question: “How many glasses, cans, or cartons containing 250 mL (roughly 250 g) of SSBs or LNSSBs did you drink yesterday?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intake was averaged across at least two recalls, and participants were grouped into three intake categories: none, more than 0 to one serving per day, or more than one serving per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome was incident MASLD, and secondary outcomes included liver-related mortality and liver fat content measured using MRI-derived proton density fat fraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fully adjusted multivariable Cox model, compared with no consumption, consuming more than one serving of LNSSBs daily was associated with a 60% higher risk for MASLD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.599). The level of consumption of SSBs was associated with a 50% higher risk (HR, 1.469).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming more than one serving of LNSSBs daily was also associated with a higher risk for severe liver outcomes (HR, 1.555), while SSBs showed no significant association after adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither SSBs nor LNSSBs showed significant associations with all-cause mortality in fully adjusted models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substituting either beverage with water reduced the risk for MASLD by 12.8% for SSBs and 15.2% for LNSSBs, Liu reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both beverage types were positively associated with higher liver fat content. Consumption of more than one serving of SSBs and LNSSBs daily was associated with about 5% and 7% higher liver fat levels, respectively, than nonconsumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The higher sugar content in SSBs can cause rapid spikes in blood glucose and &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2089224-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, promote weight gain, and increase uric acid levels, all of which contribute to liver fat accumulation. LNSSBs, on the other hand, may affect liver health by altering the gut microbiome, disrupting the feeling of fullness, driving sweet cravings, and even stimulating insulin secretion,” Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The safest approach is to limit both sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened drinks. Water remains the best choice as it removes the metabolic burden and prevents fat accumulation in the liver, whilst hydrating the body,” she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Study Needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reached for comment, Sujit V. Janardhan, MD, PhD, director of the steatotic liver disease program, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, said the findings “certainly should cause one to take pause from the popular notion that diet or non-sugar-sweetened beverages are healthier than their sugar-sweetened alternatives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cautioned, however, that it would be “important to confirm cofounders are adequately addressed in this large population-based study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We must better understand what other exposure and characteristics were present in patients who had increased intake of non-sugar-sweetened beverages,” Janardhan told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, it’s possible people who drank more non-sugar-sweetened beverages had more cardiovascular or metabolic risk factors (which prompted them to switch to the ‘diet’ alternative) and that it is these comorbidities that drove an association with increased MASLD incidence and liver-related mortality,” Janardhan noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there is one finding that seems easy to take away from this study, it’s that people who drank more water in place of sweetened beverages had reduced risk of MASLD,” he told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, while awaiting results of mechanistic studies and careful confounder analysis, “plain old boring water is your best bet,” Janardhan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The study had no specific funding. Liu and Janardhan had no relevant disclosures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 13:01:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOb0QwbndaelUzSkF1SDZxOGJYSF9YMVNvdTVpT1pFUEZqbGphUklYeC1uSW1JNWQ5Nlpqblozb1hvYzJxVUg3bzY4bXhTLU5RZWdEVDQyS196WXA0c1hBd3pQLUtPZGFnNTJSaExBc3dPSm85Mm10ZlhVT1lZRTVOYUpqZ3ptbUtONGdQM3V5dGhORlF1QTVURw</guid></item></channel></rss>
